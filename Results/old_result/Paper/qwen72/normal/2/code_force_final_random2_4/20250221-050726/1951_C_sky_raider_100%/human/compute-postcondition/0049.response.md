The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables, which were previously defined in the initial state. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. **`n`**: Initially, `n` was set to a specific value. After the code execution, `n` is updated to the first integer read from the input.
2. **`m`**: Initially, `m` was the second integer read from the input. After the code execution, `m` is updated to the second integer read from the input.
3. **`k`**: Initially, `k` was calculated as `k - n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial `k`. After the code execution, `k` is updated to the third integer read from the input.

The other variables (`i`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c`) are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as they were initially defined.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (unchanged), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (which may change with each iteration), and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
