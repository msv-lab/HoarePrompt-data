Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.** 

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value `100000.0 + 1`, which evaluates to `100001`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
