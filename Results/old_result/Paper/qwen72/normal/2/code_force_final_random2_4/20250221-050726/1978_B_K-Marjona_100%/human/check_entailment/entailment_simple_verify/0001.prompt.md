You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the total cost for the buns is `a * n`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the total cost for the buns is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. The loop variable `_` is now equal to `t - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the maximum profit from selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the fixed price `a`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This choice is based on the idea that if `b` is greater than `a`, it is beneficial to use the promotional pricing for as many buns as possible, up to the point where the promotional price is still higher than the regular price `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the regular price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as the sum of the promotional prices for the first `k` buns plus the regular price for the remaining `n - k` buns. The formula used is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `b * k` is the total price if all `k` buns were sold at `b`.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price, which forms an arithmetic series.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the profit from the remaining buns sold at the regular price.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `b <= a` correctly by selling all buns at the regular price.
   - The program also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints (up to \(10^9\)).

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
