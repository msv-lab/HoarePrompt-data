Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 1) to `pans`. Therefore, regardless of the value of `s`, `pans` is now `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
