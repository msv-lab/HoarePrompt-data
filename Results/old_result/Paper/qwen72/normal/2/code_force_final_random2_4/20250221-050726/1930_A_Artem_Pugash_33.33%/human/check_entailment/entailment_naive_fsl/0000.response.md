Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it handles the input and processes the numbers. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `numbers` list is sorted and processed:

1. **Sorting Issue**: The program sorts the `numbers` list but does not convert the elements to integers before sorting. This means that the sorting is done lexicographically (as strings), which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the list `['10', '2', '3']` would be sorted as `['10', '2', '3']` instead of `[2, 3, 10]`.

2. **Conversion Issue**: The program converts the elements to integers only when they are popped from the list, which is too late. This can cause issues if the elements are not handled correctly during the sorting process.

To fix this, the program should convert the input to integers before sorting. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are sorted correctly and the logic for calculating the maximum score works as intended.
