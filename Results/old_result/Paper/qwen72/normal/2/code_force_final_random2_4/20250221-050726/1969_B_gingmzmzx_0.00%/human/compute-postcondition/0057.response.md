To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which in this case is `c` and `s`.

- The variable `c` will take on each value from the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string.
- `n` is 1 (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s` (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `cnt` is [0, 0] (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `ans` is 0 (this does not affect the loop directly).

To ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least one element. The variable `c` will be set to the first element of `s` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`**
