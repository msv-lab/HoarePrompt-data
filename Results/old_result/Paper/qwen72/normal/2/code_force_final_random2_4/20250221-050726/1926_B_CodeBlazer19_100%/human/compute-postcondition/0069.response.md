Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is an input string.**

The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new state includes the updated value of `s` as an input string.
