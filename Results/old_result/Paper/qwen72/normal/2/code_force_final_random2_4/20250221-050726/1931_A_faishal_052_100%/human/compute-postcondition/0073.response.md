Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1, 1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26, 1]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains [1]. In all cases, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.**
