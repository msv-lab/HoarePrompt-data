Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0
- `casos` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, or 3
- The current value of `n` is 4

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'..##..##'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will print the string exactly as it is.

Output: **..##..##**
