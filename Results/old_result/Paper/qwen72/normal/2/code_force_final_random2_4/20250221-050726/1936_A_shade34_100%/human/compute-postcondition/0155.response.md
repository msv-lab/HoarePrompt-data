To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1).
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.
- If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive of 1, exclusive of `n`).
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change between iterations.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1.**
