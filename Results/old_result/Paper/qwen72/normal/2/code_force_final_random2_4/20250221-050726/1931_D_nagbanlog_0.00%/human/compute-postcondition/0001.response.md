To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of specific data structures and values as described.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a non-empty list. The variable `case` will take the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is a list with at least one test case, and `case` is the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
