The provided code snippet assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of `input` from its default (which reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and strips a trailing newline) to reading the entire input stream until EOF.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a. `input` now refers to the function `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input stream until EOF.**
