Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list of 30 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '1' and the rest of the list remains unchanged. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` are both '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[i]` is set to '-1', and `s[i + 1]` remains '1'. If `flag` is 0 and the condition `s[i] == s[i + 1]` and `s[i] == '1'` is not met, the list `s` remains unchanged, and `flag` is still 0.***
