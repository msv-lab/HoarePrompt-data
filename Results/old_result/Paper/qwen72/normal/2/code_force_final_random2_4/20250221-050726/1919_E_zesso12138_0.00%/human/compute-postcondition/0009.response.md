Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the value of `p` to a list of `n` integers, which are extracted from the slice `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers.
- The initial state specifies that `index` is 2 and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. Therefore, the slice `data[index:index + n]` extracts `n` elements starting from the third element (index 2) of the `data` list.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
