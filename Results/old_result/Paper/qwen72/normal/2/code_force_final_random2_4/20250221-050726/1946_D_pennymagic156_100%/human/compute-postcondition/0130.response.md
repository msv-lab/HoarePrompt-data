The code `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 2 elements
- `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 27
- `op` is the 28th bit of `val`
- `ai` is 0
- `val` is the second element in the list `a`

The impact of the code:
- `ai` is updated to the result of `ai ^ val`. Since `ai` is initially 0, `ai` will now be equal to `val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 2 elements
- `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 27
- `op` is the 28th bit of `val`
- `ai` is `val`
- `val` is the second element in the list `a`

Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the second element in the list `a`.**
