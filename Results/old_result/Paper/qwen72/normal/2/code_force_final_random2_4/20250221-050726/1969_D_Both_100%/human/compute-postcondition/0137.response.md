Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `current_profit` to 0. This does not affect any other variables, so the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The updated state reflects this change in `current_profit`.
