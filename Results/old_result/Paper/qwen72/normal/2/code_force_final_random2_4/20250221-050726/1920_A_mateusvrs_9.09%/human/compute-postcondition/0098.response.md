To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `n` is 0
- `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input
- `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1
- `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2
- `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `i` is the last element in `cx`
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of such elements up to the last iteration.

Code Snippet:
```python
r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `tmp`:**
   - If `i` (the last element in `cx`) is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that also fall within this range.
   - If `i` is outside this range, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range up to the last iteration.

2. **Calculate the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`:**
   - This expression calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx`, adds 1, and then subtracts `tmp`.

3. **Append the result to the list `r`:**
   - The result of the expression is appended to the list `r`.

Output State:
- `n` is 0
- `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input
- `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1
- `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2
- `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2
- `bx` is less than `ax`
- `i` is the last element in `cx`
- `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax` if `i` is within the range, otherwise it is the count of such elements up to the last iteration
- `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the last element in `cx`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax` if `i` is within the range, otherwise it is the count of such elements up to the last iteration, `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
