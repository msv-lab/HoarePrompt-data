The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` being less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 (specifically, `m` must be greater than 3 for `_` to be less than `m - 2`).

State: **`_` is 2, `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.**
