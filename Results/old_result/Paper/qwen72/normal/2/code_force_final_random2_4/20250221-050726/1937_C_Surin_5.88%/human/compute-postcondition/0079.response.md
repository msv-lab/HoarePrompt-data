Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `prev` to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `prev` while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
