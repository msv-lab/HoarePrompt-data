Functionality: ** The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves calculating the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selecting up to `k` items from a list of items. Each item has a price (from the `prices` list) and a bonus (from the `bonuses` list). The function reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n` (the number of items) and `k` (the number of items to select), along with the `prices` and `bonuses` lists. It then calculates the maximum profit by considering the combined effect of prices and bonuses, ensuring that the selected items maximize the total profit. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the variables used in the last test case, with `test_cases` being 0. **
