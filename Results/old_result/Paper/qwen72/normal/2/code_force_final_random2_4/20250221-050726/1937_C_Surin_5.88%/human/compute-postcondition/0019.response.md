Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then the current value of `r` is `<`.** 

Explanation: The value of `v1` is updated to be equal to the value of `v2`, which is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
