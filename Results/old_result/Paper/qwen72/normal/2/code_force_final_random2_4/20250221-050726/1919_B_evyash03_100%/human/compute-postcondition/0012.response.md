Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` is the number of "-" characters in `expression`.** 

Explanation: The variable `sub` is calculated as the difference between the total length of the string `expression` and the number of "+" characters (`count`). Since `expression` consists only of "+" and "-", `sub` represents the number of "-" characters in `expression`. The other variables remain unchanged.
