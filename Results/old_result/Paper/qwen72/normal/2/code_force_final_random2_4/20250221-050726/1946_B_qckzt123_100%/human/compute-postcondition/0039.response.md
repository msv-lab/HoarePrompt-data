Output State: **`t` is now the remainder of `t` divided by `MOD`, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the last element processed in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is now `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD + t % MOD`, `i` is 2, `k - 1` must be greater than 2, `ans` is now `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD + t % MOD) % MOD`.**
