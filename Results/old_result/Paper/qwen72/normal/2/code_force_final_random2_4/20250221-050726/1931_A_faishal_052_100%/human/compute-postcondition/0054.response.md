Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive), `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], `arr` is [26].**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since `lex` was initially an input integer between 28 and 51, subtracting 26 from it results in a new value for `lex` that is between 2 and 25.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
