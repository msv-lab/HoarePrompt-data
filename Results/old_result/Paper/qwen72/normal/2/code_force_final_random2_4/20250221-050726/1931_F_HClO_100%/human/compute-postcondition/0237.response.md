The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 3
- `a3` is the first integer from the input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element

After executing the code snippet:
- `a3` is reassigned to the first integer from the new input.
- `l3` is reassigned to a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged.
- The value of `val` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` as its last element.**
