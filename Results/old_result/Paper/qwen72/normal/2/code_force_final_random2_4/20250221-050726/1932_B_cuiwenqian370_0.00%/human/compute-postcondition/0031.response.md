The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of signs, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function returns the result based on the following cases:
- Case_1: For each test case, the function processes the periodicities of the signs and returns a specific output based on the periodicities.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of signs), and `path` (a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs). It processes the periodicities for each test case and returns a specific output based on these periodicities.**
