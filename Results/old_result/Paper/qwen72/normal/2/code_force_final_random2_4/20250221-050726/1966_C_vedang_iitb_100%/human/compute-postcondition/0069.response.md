Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the following rules: If the smallest positive integer not present in the list (MEX) is greater than the maximum number of stones in any pile, the winner is Alice if MEX is even, otherwise Bob. If the MEX is less than or equal to the maximum number of stones, the winner is Alice if MEX is odd, otherwise Bob. The function prints the winner for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, leaving `t` greater than 0, `tc` equal to `t-1`, `n` as the last input integer, `a` as the last sorted list of integers, `maxsize` as the maximum value in the last list, and `mexsize` as the smallest positive integer not present in the last list. **
