Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of the previous `ans` value divided by `MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t * 2`.
- Since `t` was initially the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, after multiplying by 2, `t` is now the new remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`.
- The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains the same as it was not modified by the code.
