Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `0` and the original value of `tmp`, `tmp` is now `0`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is set to `0`, overriding its previous value.
- `t` retains its value as the maximum of `0` and the original value of `tmp`.
- `_` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
