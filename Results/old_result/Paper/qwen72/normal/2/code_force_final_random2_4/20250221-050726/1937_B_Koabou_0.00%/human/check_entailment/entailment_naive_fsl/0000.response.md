Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string is flawed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`. This approach is not comprehensive and may miss other valid paths that could yield a lexicographically smaller string.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0101
     0000
     ```
     The correct lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, but the program will incorrectly output `01000`.

2. **Path Counting Logic**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also flawed. The variable `t` is used to count the paths, but the way it is calculated does not accurately reflect the number of valid paths.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     0000
     0000
     ```
     The correct number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string `00000` is `2`, but the program will output `1`.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
1
4
0101
0000
```
The program will output:
```
01000
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
00000
2
```

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
