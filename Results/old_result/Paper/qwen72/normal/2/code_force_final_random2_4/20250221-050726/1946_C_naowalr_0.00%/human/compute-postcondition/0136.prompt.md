You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `z` is `t - 1` (which is the total number of iterations completed), `n` and `k` are the last values read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variable `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R - L <= 1`, and `L` is the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) are met, and `R` is `L + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these parameters according to some logic (not specified) and returns a result based on the input values. The exact nature of the return value is not provided, but it is likely related to the constraints and relationships between the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
