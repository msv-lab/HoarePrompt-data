You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: The loop terminates when `low` becomes greater than `high`. At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum value of `profit_mid` encountered during the loop iterations. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `low` and `high` will have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, but their final values depend on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and the results of `func_1`.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) encountered during the loop iterations, which is the highest value of `profit_mid` found while adjusting `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (with 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) and returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) calculated during the loop iterations, which is the highest value of `profit_mid` found while adjusting `low` and `high`. The input parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) encountered during the loop iterations, which is the highest value of `profit_mid` found while adjusting `low` and `high`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
