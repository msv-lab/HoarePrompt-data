Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a[0]` matches the first character of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
