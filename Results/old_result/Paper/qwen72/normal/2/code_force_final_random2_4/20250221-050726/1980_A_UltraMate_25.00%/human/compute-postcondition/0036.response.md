Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `ans` is 0, `t` is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `t` is now `t - 1`, as specified in the initial state.
