To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is -1.
   - `el` is the first character of `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is 0.
   - `preOne` is an empty list.
   - `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all '<' characters in `s1`.
   - `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s1` is a string, but its exact content is not provided.
   - `el` is the first character of `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is 0, indicating no '1' characters have been counted.
   - `preOne` is an empty list, indicating no prefix sums of '1' characters have been computed.
   - `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all '<' characters in `s1`.
   - `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`.

3. **Analyzing `ans`:**
   - The `ans` list is computed based on the positions in `s1`.
   - Since the exact content of `s1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values in `ans`.
   - However, we know that `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`.

4. **Output of `print(*ans)`:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Without the exact content of `s1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in `ans`, but we can describe the output in terms of the computed values.

Output: **the computed values for each position in the string s1 (where s1 is the input string and ans contains the computed values for each position in s1)**
