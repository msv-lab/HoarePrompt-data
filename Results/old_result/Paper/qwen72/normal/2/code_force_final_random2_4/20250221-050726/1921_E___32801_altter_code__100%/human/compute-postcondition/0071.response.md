The value of `y2` is decremented by `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `y2` was initially `r[5]`, after the operation, `y2` becomes `r[5] - a`.

The conditions `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `y1 <= y2` are still valid, but `y2` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `b` is `(r[4] - a) - r[2]`, `t` is `abs(r[5] - 1)`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `y1 <= y2`.**
