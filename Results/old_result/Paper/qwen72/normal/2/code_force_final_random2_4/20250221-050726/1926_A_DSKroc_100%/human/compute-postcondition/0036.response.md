The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ac` was either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` was 'A' or not. If `i` was 'A', `ac` was 1 and now becomes 2. If `i` was not 'A', `ac` was 0 and now becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `s` is a new input string that must contain at least two characters, `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1.**
