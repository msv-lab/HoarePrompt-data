Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is either `req` or `req - 2`. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice. If `k` is not 0, the program continues executing the next part of the code.***
