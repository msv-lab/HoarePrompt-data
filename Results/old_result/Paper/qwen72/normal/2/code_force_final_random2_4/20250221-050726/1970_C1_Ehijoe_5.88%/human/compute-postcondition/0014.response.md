The code snippet `tree.append(u)` adds the integer `u` to the end of the deque `tree`. Since `tree` was initially an empty deque, after appending `u`, `tree` now contains only one element, which is `u`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` (which is now `u`) but is equal to the last element of `tree` (which is also `u`) still hold true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` but is equal to the last element of `tree`.**
