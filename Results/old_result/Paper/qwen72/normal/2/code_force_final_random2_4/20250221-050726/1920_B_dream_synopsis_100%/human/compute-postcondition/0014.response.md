The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`, `i` is not 0, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
