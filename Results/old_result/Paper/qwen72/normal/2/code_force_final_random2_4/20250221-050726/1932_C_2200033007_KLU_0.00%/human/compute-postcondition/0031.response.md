Output State: **`b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p * v, p]`, `p` is the product of the last element and the second-to-last element of `b`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the end of the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains `[p * v]`.
- After appending `p`, `ans` now contains `[p * v, p]`.
- All other variables (`b`, `v`, `n`, `p`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
