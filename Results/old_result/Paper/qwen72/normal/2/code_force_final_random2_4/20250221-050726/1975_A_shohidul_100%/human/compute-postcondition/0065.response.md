To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **_ is 1**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**: This variable is also not used in the print statement.
3. **n must be greater than 2**: This indicates that the list `a` has at least 3 elements.
4. **a is a list of integers read from the input**: This is the list of integers that we are working with.
5. **check_all is True if the list a is non-decreasing from index 1 to n-1, otherwise False**: This checks if the elements from index 1 to n-1 are in non-decreasing order.
6. **i is 2**: This is just an index variable, not used in the print statement.
7. **new is a list containing all elements of a starting from index 2 to the end of the list**: This is a sublist of `a` starting from the third element.
8. **check_all_new is True if all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], otherwise False**: This checks if all elements in the sublist `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`.
9. **new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, otherwise False**: This checks if the elements in the sublist `new` are in non-decreasing order.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state. The print statement itself does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned; it simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
