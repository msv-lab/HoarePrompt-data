Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is overly simplified and does not account for the iterative process of removing players from the game according to the rules specified. Specifically, the function only checks if the first element of the sequence `a` is less than or equal to the number of players `b`, which is insufficient to model the game's rules. The game involves multiple rounds where specific players are removed based on the sequence `a`, and this process continues until no more players can be removed. The program needs to simulate this process accurately to determine the number of winners for each `n_i`.
