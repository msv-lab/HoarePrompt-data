Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[2] == b[1]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans1` now contains the elements at index 2 of `b` appended to its previous content. If `b[2] != b[1]`, and `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[2] != b[3]`, `l` now includes the element at index 2 of `b`. If `b[2] == b[3]`, `l` remains unchanged.***
