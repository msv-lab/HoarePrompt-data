The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains elements based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, the string 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, the string 'no' is added to `results`.**
