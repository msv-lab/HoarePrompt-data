Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000.
- `numCases` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.

Given that `numbers` is an empty list, there are no integers to form pairs, and thus no minimum values to sum. Therefore, `suma` will be 0.

Output: **0**
