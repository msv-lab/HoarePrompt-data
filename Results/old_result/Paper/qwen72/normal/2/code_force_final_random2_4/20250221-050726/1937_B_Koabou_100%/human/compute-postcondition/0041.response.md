Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is at least 1, `y` is 0, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke. If the substring `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the substring `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
