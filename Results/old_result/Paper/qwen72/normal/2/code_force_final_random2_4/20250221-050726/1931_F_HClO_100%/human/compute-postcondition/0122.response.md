The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several pieces of information about the variables and objects in the program:
  - `_` is set to `m-3`, where `m` is at least 3.
  - `a3` and `l3` will be set by the second tuple in `val`.
  - `val` is a list containing at least two tuples.

However, none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
