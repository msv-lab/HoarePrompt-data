Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 2, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, plus 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, plus 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[2]` and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list and `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `zero_perc` is calculated based on the updated formula, which divides by `i + 1` instead of `2`.
- The rest of the conditions and variables (`one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, etc.) remain as they were in the initial state.
