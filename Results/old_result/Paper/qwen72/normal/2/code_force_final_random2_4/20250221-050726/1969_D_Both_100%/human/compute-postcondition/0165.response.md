Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now one element shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last one, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` adjusted by either subtracting `item[1]` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or adding `item[0]` if the sum is less than 0, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than the original `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by `item`, and `removed_item` is not None.**
