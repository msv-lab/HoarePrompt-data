Based on the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements, which can be either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `result` is the second element in the `results` list.

When the `print(result)` statement is executed, it will print the second element of the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the results list, which can be either 'YES' or 'NO')**
