Output State: **`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` for any tuple in `val`, the program prints 'no' and exits the loop. If all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition, the program prints 'yes'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains `m-3`.
- The variable `m` is at least 3.
- The variables `a3` and `l3` are set by the last tuple in the list `val`.
- The list `val` contains at least `m-2` tuples.
- For each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, the loop checks if `l3` is equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.
- If any tuple does not satisfy this condition, the program prints 'no' and exits the loop.
- If all tuples satisfy the condition, the program prints 'yes'.
