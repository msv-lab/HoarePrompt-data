Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
