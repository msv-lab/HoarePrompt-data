Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is either `k % 1` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0]) - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.***
