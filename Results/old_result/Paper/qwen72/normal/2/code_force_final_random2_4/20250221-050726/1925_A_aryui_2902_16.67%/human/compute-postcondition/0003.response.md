The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers within the range 1 to 26. It returns a string composed of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.**
