The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop variable since it's not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Since the state before the loop includes `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), we can assume that `t` is the number of times the loop should run. Therefore, the input should be `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the input is `t`**
