Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or "a0cd", `x` is 0, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', then `y` is set to 1. Otherwise, `y` remains 0.***
