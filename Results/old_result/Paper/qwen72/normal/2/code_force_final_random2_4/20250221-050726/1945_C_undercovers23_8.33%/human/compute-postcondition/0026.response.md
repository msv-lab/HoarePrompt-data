The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i < n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 or 0, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
