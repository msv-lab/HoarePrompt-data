To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`.
   - `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is calculated based on `num2`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must still be less than or equal to `median`.
   - Given that `new_median` is initially equal to `b[ma]` and `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `new_median` will be greater than `median` after the increment.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `new_median` is already greater than `median` after the increment, the loop condition `new_median <= median` will no longer be true.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states in the loop head for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will not execute again because the condition will be false.

### Final State:
Since the loop will not execute again, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` (which is `median`), `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.**
