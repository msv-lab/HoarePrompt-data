### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m` is 1, it directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot always corresponds to some order.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the lists `l1` and `l2` (excluding the author of the screenshot).
   - It checks if the lists `l11` (filtered `l1` to exclude `a2`) and `l22` (filtered `l2` to exclude `a1`) are equal. If they are not, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.

3. **Finding the Insertion Points**:
   - The program initializes indices `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the positions where `a2` and `a1` should be inserted to make the lists match.
   - It updates the indices and positions based on the conditions found during the iteration.

4. **Handling the Insertions**:
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, it inserts `a2` into `l2` or `a1` into `l1` to create a consistent order.
   - If `m` is 2, it prints "yes" and continues to the next test case.

5. **Validating Remaining Screenshots**:
   - For the remaining screenshots, it reads each one and checks if the list `l3` (excluding the author `a3`) matches the constructed list `l`.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial checks and the processing of the first two screenshots.
- It correctly identifies the insertion points and constructs the consistent order.
- It validates the remaining screenshots against the constructed order and prints the appropriate result.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
