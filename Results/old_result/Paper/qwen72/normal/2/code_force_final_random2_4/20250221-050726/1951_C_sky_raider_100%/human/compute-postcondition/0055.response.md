To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop starts, but in the context of the loop, `i` should start from 0 (or another initial value depending on the range).
- The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be set to 0, as this is the typical starting point for a loop counter.
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, and `c` is 0**
