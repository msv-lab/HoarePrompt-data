Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0. `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0. `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decremented by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, and `ans[n-2]` is updated based on the comparison between `ol` (which is `totalOne`) and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`). If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `ans[n-2]` is set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans[n-2]` is set to `- func_1(preOne, zr + 1) + func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to include `i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is updated based on the comparison between `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) and `ol` (which is `totalOne`). If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
