Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. A line of input has been read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
