Output State: **The function reads from standard input, but does not modify any variables or states directly. The initial state remains unchanged: The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases t is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The input data is split into a list called `data`. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.**
