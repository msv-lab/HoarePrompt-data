Output State: **`i` is the length of `l` minus 1, `ans1` is a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2, `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the elements starting from the `n`-th element to the end, `req` is equal to the new value of `k`, if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
