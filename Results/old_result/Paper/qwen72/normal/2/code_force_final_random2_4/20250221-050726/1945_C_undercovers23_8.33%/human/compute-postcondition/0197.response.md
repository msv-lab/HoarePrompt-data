The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `lst`.

State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` of `lst` is also equal to `mini`, then `final` contains both the first and the second elements of `lst`. `lst` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`.**
