Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers read from the input, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each iteration. The loop has executed `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of all `t` test cases.**

This means that the loop has completed all its iterations, processing `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` were read from the input, a list of `m` friendships was constructed, and the function `func_1` was called with these parameters, printing the result for each test case. After all iterations, `t` is now 0 or has been decremented to 0 if it was initially positive. The final state reflects the completion of all test cases, with each `result` printed as specified.
