The code snippet sets the variable `b` to the string `'SQUARE'`. This impacts the value of `b` regardless of the conditions described in the initial state. However, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, as well as the value of `a` which depends on the content of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` remains 0 if `s` contains no '1' characters or if `s` contains more than one '1' character, otherwise `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.**
