Output State: **`sumo` is now `a[bets - 1] + a[bets] + int(a[i])`, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 2, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets + 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[i])` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `sumo` is now `a[bets - 1] + a[bets] + int(a[i])`.
