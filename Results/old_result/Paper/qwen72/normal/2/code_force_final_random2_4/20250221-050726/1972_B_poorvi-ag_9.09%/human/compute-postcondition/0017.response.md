The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This changes the content of `results` but does not affect the other variables. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `results` is a list containing ['no', 'no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise ['no', 'no'].**
