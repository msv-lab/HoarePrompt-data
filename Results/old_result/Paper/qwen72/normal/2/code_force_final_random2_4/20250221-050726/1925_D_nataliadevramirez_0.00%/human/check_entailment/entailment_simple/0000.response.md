### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen.
   - The final answer should be calculated as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
     - It iterates over each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)` and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total result.
     - The formula used is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
     - This formula calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value `f`.
     - The result is accumulated in the `result` variable and returned modulo `MOD`.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the `m` friendship tuples.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Formula Verification:**
     - The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` correctly calculates the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair over `k` excursions.
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is indeed `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

   - **Modulo Operation:**
     - The use of `% MOD` ensures that the result fits within the required constraints and avoids overflow.

   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friendships) correctly by returning 0.
     - The program also handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly by returning the initial friendship values.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The use of modular arithmetic and the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers are appropriate and correctly applied.
