The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1 and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.**
