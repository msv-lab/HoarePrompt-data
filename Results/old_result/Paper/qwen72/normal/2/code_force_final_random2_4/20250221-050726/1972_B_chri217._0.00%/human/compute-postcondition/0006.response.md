Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, where `s` is a sequence of characters "U" and "D" representing the states of coins. It counts the number of "U" characters in the string. If the count of "U" is odd, the function returns 'YES'. If the count of "U" is even, the function returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input string `s`. **
