Output State: **`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, and the length of `path` is at least 1; `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of integers with length `n`, where each element of `dp` has been updated according to the rules specified in the loop. The final value of `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- `path` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n` remains the length of `path`.
- `dp` is a list of integers with the same length as `path`.
- Each element of `dp` has been updated based on the corresponding element in `path` and the previous elements in `dp` according to the rules specified in the loop.
- The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n - 1`, so the final value of `i` is `n`.
