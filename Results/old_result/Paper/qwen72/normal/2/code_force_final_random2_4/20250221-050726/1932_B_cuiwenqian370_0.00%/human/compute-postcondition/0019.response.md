Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 5, `path` is `data[index-2]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so the total increment from the initial state is 5.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[index-1]`, which is now `data[index-1]` after the increment.
- `path` is updated to `data[index-2]` because `index` has been incremented by 1.
- `results` still includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content, as no changes were made to `results` in the given code snippet.
- The condition for `t` remains unchanged.
