Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`. The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
