Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The length of `s` is greater than 1.
- The string `s` contains at least two different characters.
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains a randomly shuffled version of `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides conditions about the variables `t`, `s`, and `s2`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Output: **Yes**
