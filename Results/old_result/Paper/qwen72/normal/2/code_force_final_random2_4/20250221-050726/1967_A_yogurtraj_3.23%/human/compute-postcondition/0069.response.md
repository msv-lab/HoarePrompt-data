Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`, and `y` is 0.***
