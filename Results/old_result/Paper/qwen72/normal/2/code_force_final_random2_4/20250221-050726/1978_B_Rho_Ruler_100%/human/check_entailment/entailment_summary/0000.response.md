Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can make from selling buns under specific pricing conditions. The solution involves two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given value of `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
   - The formula used is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), which correctly accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the modified prices and the constant price for the remaining buns.
   - The function is mathematically sound and correctly implements the logic for calculating the profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `min(n, b)` respectively, and iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and the next midpoint (`mid + 1`).
   - The function updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits at each step and adjusts the search range accordingly.
   - The binary search ensures that the function efficiently finds the maximum profit within the constraints.

The combination of these two functions correctly addresses the problem statement. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found, and `func_1` accurately calculates the profit for any given `k`. The program handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
