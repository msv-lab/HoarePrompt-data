Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Variables:
- `n`: A positive integer within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `k`: A positive integer within the range \( 1 \leq k \leq n \).
- `v`: The value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is 2, `v` will be 1 because there is no `i` that equals `n` in the given context.
- `i`: 2.
- `cnt`: `k`.
- `l`: 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
- `l` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `v` is 1 (as explained above).

So, the expression `i * v` evaluates to `2 * 1`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `? 1 2` with a flush to ensure immediate printing.

Output: **? 1 2**
