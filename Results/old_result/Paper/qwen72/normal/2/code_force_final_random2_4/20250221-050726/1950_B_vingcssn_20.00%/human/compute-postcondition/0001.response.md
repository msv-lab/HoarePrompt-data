The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `casos`. If `casos` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the variable `c` should be initialized to 0, and `casos` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`c` is 0, `casos` must be greater than 0**
