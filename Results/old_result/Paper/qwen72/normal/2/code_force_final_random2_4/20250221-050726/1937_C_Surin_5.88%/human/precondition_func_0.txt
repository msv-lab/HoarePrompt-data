The function operates within an interactive environment where it interacts with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function receives input through a series of queries and outputs the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
