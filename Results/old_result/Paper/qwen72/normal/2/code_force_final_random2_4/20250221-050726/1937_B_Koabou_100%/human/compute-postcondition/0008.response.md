Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: After the loop completes its execution, the list `a` contains exactly two elements, each of which is a user input. The first element is the input provided during the first iteration, and the second element is the input provided during the second iteration.
- **`_`**: The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Since the loop runs twice (`range(2)`), the final value of `_` is 1 (it starts from 0 and increments to 1).
