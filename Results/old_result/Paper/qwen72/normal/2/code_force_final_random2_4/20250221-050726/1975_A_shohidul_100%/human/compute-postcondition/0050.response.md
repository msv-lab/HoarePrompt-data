The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements from the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. Since `i` is 1, `new` will contain all elements of `a` starting from index 1.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`
- `i` is 1
- The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`

After executing the code:
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.**
