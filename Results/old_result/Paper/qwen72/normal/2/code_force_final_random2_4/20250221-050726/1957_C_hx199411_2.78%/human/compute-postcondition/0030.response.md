Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is `k - 1`; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input. `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations. `m` is `n - num`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.**
