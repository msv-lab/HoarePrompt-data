Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until it is empty.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Must still be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Initially a sorted list of strings in ascending order, but after the loop completes, it becomes an empty list because all elements have been popped out.
- **`suma`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the `numbers` list. After the loop completes, `suma` will contain the total sum of these minimum values.
