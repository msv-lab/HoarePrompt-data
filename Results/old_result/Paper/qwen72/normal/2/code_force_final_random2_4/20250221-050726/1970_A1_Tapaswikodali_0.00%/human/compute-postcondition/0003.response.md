The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `char`, and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string input by the user, and it is expected to be a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `balance` is 0.
- `details` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least one character. The variable `i` will start at 0, and `char` will be the first character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, `balance` is 0, `details` is an empty list**
