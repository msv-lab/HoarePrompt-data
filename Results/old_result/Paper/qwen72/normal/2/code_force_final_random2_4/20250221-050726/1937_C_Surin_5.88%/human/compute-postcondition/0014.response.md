The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then the current value of `r` is `<`.**
