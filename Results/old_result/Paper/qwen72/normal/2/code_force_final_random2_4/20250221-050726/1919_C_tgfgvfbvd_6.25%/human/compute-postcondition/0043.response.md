Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is set to 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, and if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `b` (or both), then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In all cases, `a` and `b` maintain their roles as the first integer in the list `l` and the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists.***
