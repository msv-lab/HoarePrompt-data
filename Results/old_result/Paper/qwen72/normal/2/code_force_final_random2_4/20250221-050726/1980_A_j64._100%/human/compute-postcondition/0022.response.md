Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a string). It calculates and returns the total number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The function does not modify the input parameters and only returns the computed integer value. **
