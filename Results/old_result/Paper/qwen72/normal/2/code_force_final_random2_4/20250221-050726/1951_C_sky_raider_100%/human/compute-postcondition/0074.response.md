Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the constraints on daily purchases and ticket prices. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the total cost for each test case. The final state includes `k` being reduced to 0 or a non-negative integer less than the initial `k`, `l` being a sorted list of ticket prices, and `c` holding the total cost of the tickets bought. **
