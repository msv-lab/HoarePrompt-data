Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list unless `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the tuple with the highest second element from `combined` and, if the if condition is true, the last element of `combined` before the operation, plus the tuple that was just popped from `combined`. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it is one element shorter.**
