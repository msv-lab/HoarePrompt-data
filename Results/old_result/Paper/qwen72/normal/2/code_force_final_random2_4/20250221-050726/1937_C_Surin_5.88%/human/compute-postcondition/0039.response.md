Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is 2, if `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
