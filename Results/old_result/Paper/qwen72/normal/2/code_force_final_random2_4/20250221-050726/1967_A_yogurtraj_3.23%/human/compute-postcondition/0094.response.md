The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 0.

State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
