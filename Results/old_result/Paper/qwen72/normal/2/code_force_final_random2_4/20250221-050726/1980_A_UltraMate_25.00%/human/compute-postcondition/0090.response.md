The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Given these parameters, the function's output is not specified in the problem statement. Without further details on the expected output, I cannot provide a specific return value. However, I can describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000; `n`, an integer between 1 and 50; `m`, an integer between 1 and 5; and `a`, a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
