Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the right side of `tree`. If neither of these conditions is met, the conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v` remain unchanged.***
