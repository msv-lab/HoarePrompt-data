Postcondition: ***The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. If `m` is 2, then: if `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is set to `n-2`; if `idx1` was initially -1 and `idx2` was a non-negative integer, `idx1` is set to `n-2`, `idx2` remains a non-negative integer, and `p2` is set to 1; if `l2[i + p2] == a1` was true for any `i`, `idx2` is set to that `i` value, and `p2` is set to 1; if none of the conditions involving `l1[i + p1] == a2` were met throughout the loop, `idx1` remains -1, and `p1` remains 0. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) retain their initial values. `val` is now an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. If `m` is not 2, all variables retain their initial values.***
