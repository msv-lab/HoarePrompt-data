Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
- `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.
- The output will always be the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
