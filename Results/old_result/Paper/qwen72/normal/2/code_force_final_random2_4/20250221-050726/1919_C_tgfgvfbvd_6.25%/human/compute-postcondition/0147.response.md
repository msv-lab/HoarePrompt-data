Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements encountered during the loop, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the specific update conditions within the loop.**
