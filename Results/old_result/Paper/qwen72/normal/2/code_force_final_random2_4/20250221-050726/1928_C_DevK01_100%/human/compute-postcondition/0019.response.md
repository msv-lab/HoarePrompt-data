Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 2, and `M` is `[1, q, 2, q // 2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `q // i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is 2, the new element added to `M` is `q // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
