Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), and `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.***
