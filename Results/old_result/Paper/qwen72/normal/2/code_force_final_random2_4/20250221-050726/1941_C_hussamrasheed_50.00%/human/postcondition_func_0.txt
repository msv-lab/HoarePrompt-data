The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all instances of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state includes `t` (the number of test cases), `i` (the index of the last test case processed, which is `t-1`), `n` (the length of the last input string), `s` (the last input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed), `m` (the count of 'map' in the original last input string), and `p` (the count of 'pie' in the modified last input string).
