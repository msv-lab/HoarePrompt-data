The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `bx`, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be set to the larger of `x` and its current value. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer provided by user input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value.**
