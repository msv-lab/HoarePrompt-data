Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is less than `b`. The condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` holds true, meaning the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**
