The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by adding one more element to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new user-provided integer
- `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative
- `x` is the new user-provided integer
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements
- `sums` is `sums + a[k]`

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new user-provided integer
- `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative
- `x` is the new user-provided integer
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus the value of `sums`)
- `sums` is `sums + a[k]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus the value of `sums`), `sums` is `sums + a[k]`.**
