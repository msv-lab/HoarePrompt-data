Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates Python files for each `.html` file found in subdirectories whose names fall within a specified range. However, the program provided defines a different function `func_1` that reads input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's in a string. These two programs serve entirely different purposes and are not related. Therefore, the program is incorrect with respect to the given problem description.
