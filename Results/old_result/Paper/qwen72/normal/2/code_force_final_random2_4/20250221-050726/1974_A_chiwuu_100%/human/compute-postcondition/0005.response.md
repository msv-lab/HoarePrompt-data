Output State: **`t` is equal to `b`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value).** 

The value of `t` is now equal to the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
