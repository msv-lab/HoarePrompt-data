Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `index` is incremented by 4, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The value of `index` is incremented by 4.
- The value of `path` remains `data[index-1]`, which is now `data[(index-4)-1]` or `data[index-5]`.
- The list `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.
- The condition for `t` remains unchanged.
