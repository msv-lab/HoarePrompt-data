Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]`, `arr` is `[26]`.**

Explanation:
- `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52. After subtracting 26, `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26.
- The `info` list is updated to reflect the new value of `lex` in the second sublist.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
