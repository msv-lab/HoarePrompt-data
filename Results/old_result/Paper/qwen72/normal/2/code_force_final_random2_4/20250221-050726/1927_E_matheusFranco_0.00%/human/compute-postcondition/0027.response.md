To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.
2. **Current State**:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `n`.
- Given the current state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `1 + k` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The condition `1 + k < n` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.
- Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the condition `1 + k < n` is already satisfied by the given constraints.

### Final State:
Since the condition `1 + k < n` is already satisfied by the given constraints, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is now `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus two, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.**
