The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The values of `u` and `v` are determined by the user input, but they are expected to be integers. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers.**
