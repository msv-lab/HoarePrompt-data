Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the year when the nth sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a different problem, specifically one involving a path with characters `@` and `*`. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `@` characters that can be collected while avoiding `*` characters.
     - The function does not match the requirements of the given problem. It does not handle periodic occurrences of signs or sequential waiting times.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - Since `func_1` is not designed to solve the given problem, the entire program will not produce the correct output for the specified problem.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` is designed to handle a path with characters `@` and `*`, and it uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `@` characters that can be collected while avoiding `*` characters.
   - The annotations also show that `func_2` reads input, processes test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The annotations do not indicate any handling of periodic occurrences or sequential waiting times, which are essential for solving the given problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions are designed for a different problem and do not implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur based on the given periodicities.

Final: **False**
