You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `y` is 0, and `rem` is 0. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of card types (`n`), the number of coins available (`k`), and a list of initial card counts (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of new cards that can be bought such that the total number of cards of each type is as equal as possible, given the constraints of the number of coins. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, but the printed output for each test case represents the solution to the problem.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each with a certain count.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program sorts the counts of the cards (`a`).
   - It iterates through the sorted list to find the point where the remaining coins (`k`) are insufficient to balance the counts of the next card type.
   - If `k` is sufficient, it continues to the next card type, adjusting `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` is insufficient, it calculates the maximum possible value of `r` (the minimum count of any card type after buying additional cards) and the remainder (`rem`).
   - Finally, it calculates the maximum score based on the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases, and for each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the counts of the cards.
   - **Sorting**: Sort the counts of the cards.
   - **Iterate and Adjust**:
     - For each card type, check if the remaining coins (`k`) are enough to balance the counts.
     - If not, calculate the maximum possible value of `r` and the remainder (`rem`).
     - If `k` is still non-zero after the loop, adjust `r` accordingly.
   - **Calculate Score**:
     - The score is calculated as `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `k` is zero or very large.
   - It correctly calculates the score even when the counts are already balanced or when additional cards are needed to balance the counts.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The calculations for `r`, `rem`, and `y` are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the sorting, iteration, and score calculation accurately.
