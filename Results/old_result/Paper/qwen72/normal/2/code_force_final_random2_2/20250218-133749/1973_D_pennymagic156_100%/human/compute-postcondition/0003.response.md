Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `v` is 1.
- `i` is `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `i` is equal to `n`.
2. The expression `i * n` is therefore `n * n`, which is `n^2`.

So, the print statement will output:
- The string `? 1` followed by the value of `n^2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 [n^2] (where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4)**
