Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element in the list `l`.
- The value of `t` is `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- Therefore, `c` becomes `s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
