You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

            print(*ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` from the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` from the last iteration, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` from the last iteration, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\). `l1` is a list of strings from the input. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\), \(k - 2^i + 1\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `arr` is an empty list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence must equal `k`, and the sequence must contain exactly `n` elements. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the sequence will have exactly `n` elements when `k` is less than `n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 3 2
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program will output:
```
1 1 0
```
However, this output is incorrect because the sum of the sequence is `1 + 1 + 0 = 2`, which is correct, but the number of 1s in the binary representation of `1 | 1 | 0` is 1, which is not maximized. A correct output could be:
```
2 0 0
```
This output satisfies both conditions: the sum is `2` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of `2` (which is `10` in binary) is 1, which is the maximum possible for `k = 2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
