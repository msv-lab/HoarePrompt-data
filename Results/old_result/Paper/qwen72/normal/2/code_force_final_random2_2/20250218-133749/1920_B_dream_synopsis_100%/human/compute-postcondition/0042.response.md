The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively.

- `n` is now the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is now the second integer read from the input.
- `x` is now the third integer read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and the length of `ans` is `k + 1`. The loop has executed one more time, and `t - 1` iterations remain.**
