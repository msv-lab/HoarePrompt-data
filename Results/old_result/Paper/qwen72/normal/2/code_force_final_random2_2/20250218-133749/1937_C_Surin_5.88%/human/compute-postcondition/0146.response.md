The code snippet reads a new value for `r` from user input. Depending on the value of `r`, the variable `prev` may be updated. Let's analyze the impact:

- `r` is now the new user input.
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
- If `r` is anything other than '>', `prev` remains 0.

All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, and if `r` is '>', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
