The code snippet `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. This new value is calculated by taking the last element of `suffZero`, adding `i + 1` to it, and appending the result to `suffZero`.

Given the initial state:
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.

Let's calculate the new value:
- The last element of `suffZero` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The new value to append is `0 + (n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

Therefore, `suffZero` will now contain two elements: 0 and `n`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is not '>'**.
