Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `i` is set to 28.
- `u` is assigned the value of `x` right-shifted by 28 bits, and then bitwise ANDed with 1. This effectively checks the 29th bit (from the right) of `x`.
- `v` is assigned the sum of the results of right-shifting each element in the list `a` by 28 bits and then bitwise ANDing with 1. This effectively sums the 29th bits (from the right) of all elements in `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
