Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, and `x` is greater than 0 while `y` is equal to 0. Additionally, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and either `x` is not equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0.**
