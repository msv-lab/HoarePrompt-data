To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `n`: The upper bound of the range.

For the loop to execute, the range `range(0, n - 1)` must contain at least one element. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (not relevant to the loop).
- `ii` is 2 (not relevant to the loop).
- `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from user input (not relevant to the loop).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop).
- `i` is `n - 1` (this is the initial value of `i` outside the loop, but inside the loop, `i` will be controlled by the loop itself).
- `y` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
- `r` is `a[0]` (not relevant to the loop).
- `rem` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).

The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0**
