Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `num` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and control moves to the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
