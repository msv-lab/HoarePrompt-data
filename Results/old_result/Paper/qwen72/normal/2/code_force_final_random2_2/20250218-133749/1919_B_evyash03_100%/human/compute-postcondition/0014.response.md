The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. The function returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
