Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` (which is initially 1) by the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`). Therefore, `prod` is now equal to `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
