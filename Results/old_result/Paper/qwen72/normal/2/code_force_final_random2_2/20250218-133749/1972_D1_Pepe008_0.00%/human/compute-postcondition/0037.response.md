Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\), `suma` is updated to `a + (a - 2) // 4 + 1 + (a - 6) // 9 + 1` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `suma` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1 + (a - 6) // 9 + 1\).** 

Explanation:
- The value of `suma` is incremented by `x`.
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `suma` was initially set to `a + (a - 2) // 4 + 1` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `suma` was set to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- Since `x` is \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\), `suma` is now `a + (a - 2) // 4 + 1 + (a - 6) // 9 + 1` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `suma` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1 + (a - 6) // 9 + 1\).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
