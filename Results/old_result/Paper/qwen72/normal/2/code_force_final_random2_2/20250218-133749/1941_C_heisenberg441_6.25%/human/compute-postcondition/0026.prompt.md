You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. Additionally, s is not equal to 'mapie'.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. `s` is not equal to 'mapie', does not contain the substring 'map', and may or may not contain the substring 'p'. `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 3 * `ans` (1 ≤ n - 3 * `ans` ≤ 10^6). `s` does not contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. `s` is not equal to 'mapie'. `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` and returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found in `s`. If the substring 'pie' is found, it returns the total number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1.

Case_2: The program returns the total number of times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
