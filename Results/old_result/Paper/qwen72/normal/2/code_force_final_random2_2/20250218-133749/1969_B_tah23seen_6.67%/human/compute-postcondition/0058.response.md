Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the smallest index such that `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `right` until it either finds a '0' in the list `s` or reaches the end of the list.
- After the loop completes, `right` will either point to the first occurrence of '0' in `s` or will be equal to `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
- The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `i`, and `left`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
