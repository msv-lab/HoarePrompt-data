Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is specified that `n` is not equal to 1, not equal to 2, and the current value of `n` is 3.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, the output will be the exact string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
