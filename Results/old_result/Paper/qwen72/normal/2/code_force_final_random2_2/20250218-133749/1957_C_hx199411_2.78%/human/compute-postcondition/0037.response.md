To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `i` is 4.
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except:
  - `dp[1]` which is 1,
  - `dp[2]` which is 3,
  - `dp[3]` which is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`,
  - `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `m + 1`.
- The loop variable `i` starts at 3 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 4.
- `m` must be at least 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue if `i` is still less than or equal to `m`.

### New State:
- `i` will be incremented to 5.
- `m` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[4]` which is `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
