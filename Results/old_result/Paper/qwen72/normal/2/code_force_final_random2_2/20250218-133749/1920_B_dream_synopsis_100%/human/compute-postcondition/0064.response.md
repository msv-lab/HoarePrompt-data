Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and the second element is also `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `t - 1` iterations remain, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
