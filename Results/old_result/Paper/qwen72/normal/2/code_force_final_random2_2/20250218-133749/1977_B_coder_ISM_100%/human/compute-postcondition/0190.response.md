Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1 or 0, and `flag` is 0. Additionally, `s[0]` is `'1'`, and `s[1]` is also `'1'`.**
