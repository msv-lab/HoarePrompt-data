Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 0, `x` and `a` are integers provided by user input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing `[a]`.***
