Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 52, `arr` is either an empty list if `lex` > 78 or contains the element 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is updated to `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 27, or `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, `arr` is updated to contain the element 26 appended to its previous contents, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, and `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
