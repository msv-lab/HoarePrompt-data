Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` will be an integer between 1 and 100, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, `info` will be a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr`. Each `arr` will contain three elements, where the first two elements are either 1 or 26 (depending on the value of `lex` during the iteration), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the operations inside the loop. The exact values of the elements in each `arr` depend on the input values of `lex` provided during each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, the variable `i` will be one less than the total number of iterations (`cases - 1`), and the list `info` will contain `cases` arrays, each with three elements sorted in ascending order. The elements in each array depend on the value of `lex` input during that iteration.
