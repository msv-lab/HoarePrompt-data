### Reasoning:

Let's break down the requirements and the function `func_1` to see if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Requirements:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Function Analysis:
- **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
- **Sorting**: The function sorts both the digits and letters in ascending order.
- **Validation**:
  - **Digit Order**: The function checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - **Letter Order**: The function checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - **No Digit After Letter**: The function attempts to check if no digit comes after a letter with the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:`. However, this check is incorrect because it only compares the last digit with each letter, which is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

#### Counterexample:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  5
  a1b2c
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```

The function incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the correct logic. The correct logic should ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the password.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that no digit appears after a letter. This can be done by iterating through the password and checking the relative positions of digits and letters.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if no digit comes after a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
