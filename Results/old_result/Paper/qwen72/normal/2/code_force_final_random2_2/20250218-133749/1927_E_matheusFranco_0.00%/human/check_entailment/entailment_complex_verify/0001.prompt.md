You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every index `i` that is a multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and for every index `i` that is not a multiple of `k`, `permutation[i]` is set to the next available value of `curr_v` in the sequence. The variable `curr_v` will be equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `k`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` such that each element at an index that is a multiple of `k` is set to a specific value based on the sequence, and the remaining elements are filled with the next available values in the sequence. The function then prints this permutation as a space-separated string. After the function completes, `n` and `k` retain their original values, and the permutation list is fully populated and printed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

    #State: `t` is 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the permutation:
     - The outer loop iterates over the range of `k`.
     - The inner loop fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - The value `curr_v` is incremented and placed at these positions.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It runs a loop `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm ensures that the permutation is filled in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The key idea is to distribute the numbers in a pattern that maintains the required property. By placing numbers at positions that are multiples of `k`, the algorithm ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the constraints well, including the edge cases where `k` is 2 and `n` is small.
   - The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed the limit, ensuring the algorithm is efficient.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the required format, printing the permutation as a space-separated string for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
