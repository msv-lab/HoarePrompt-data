The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1.

State: **The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The input provided must be greater than 0.**
