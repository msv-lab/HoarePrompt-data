To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is an integer input by the user.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\). This means \(i\) is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged (though they are not used in the construction of `ans`).
   - `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - Start with the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
     - Extend this list by appending `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19, except `i`.

2. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - The initial part of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - For each `j` from 0 to 19, append `1 << j` to `ans` unless `j == i`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `k = 10`.
   - The largest `i` such that \(1 << i \leq 10\) is 3 (since \(1 << 3 = 8\)).
   - The initial part of `ans` is:
     - `k - (1 << i) = 10 - 8 = 2`
     - `k + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i) = 10 + 1 + 8 = 19`
   - So, `ans` starts as `[2, 11, 19]`.
   - Now, append `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `j = 3`:
     - `1 << 0 = 1`
     - `1 << 1 = 2`
     - `1 << 2 = 4`
     - `1 << 4 = 16`
     - `1 << 5 = 32`
     - ...
     - `1 << 19 = 524288`
   - The final `ans` list will be `[2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **2 11 19 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288** (where `k` is the user input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), and the list is constructed as described).
