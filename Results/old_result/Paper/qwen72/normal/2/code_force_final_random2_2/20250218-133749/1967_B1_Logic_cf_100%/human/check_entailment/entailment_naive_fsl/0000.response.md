Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by iterating over `b` and adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the answer. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic used here is flawed and does not match the problem's requirements.

2. **Handling of GCD**: The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is a crucial part of the problem's condition. Without computing the GCD, it is impossible to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Range of Iteration**: The program iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`, but this range might not cover all possible values of `b` up to `m`. Additionally, the iteration logic does not correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` or `m` is 1, the program should return a specific result, but the current logic does not ensure this.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output should be `3` (valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`). However, the program will produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
