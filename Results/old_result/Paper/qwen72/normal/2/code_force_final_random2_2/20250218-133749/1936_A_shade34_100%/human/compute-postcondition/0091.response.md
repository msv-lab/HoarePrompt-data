Postcondition: ***`mak` is 0 or `len(pans)`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `len(pans) + 1`. The standard output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is "<", `mak` is updated to `len(pans) + 1`.***
