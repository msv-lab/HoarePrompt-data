Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` now contains `a1` inserted at position `n - 3`, `l` is now a reference to `l1`.**
