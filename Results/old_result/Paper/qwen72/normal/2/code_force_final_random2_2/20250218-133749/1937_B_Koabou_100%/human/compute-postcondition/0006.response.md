The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop iterates a fixed number of times (2 times in this case), and the value of `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already run once. Since the loop is set to run twice, it will execute one more time regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time. The state remains the same, except that the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is managed by the `range(2)` function) is incremented.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing four input strings.**
