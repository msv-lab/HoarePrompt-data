The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 1, ensuring that `i` (which is now 1) is less than `k - 1`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2 * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1**
