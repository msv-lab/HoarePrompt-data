The code snippet provided constructs a new list `nums` by converting the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` to a list of its digits and appending the integer at index `i` in `arr` to this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `m - 2`
- `ans` remains True

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `i` is `m - 2`.
2. `arr[i - 1]` accesses the element at index `i - 1` in `arr`.
3. `str(arr[i - 1])` converts this element to a string.
4. `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts each character in this string back to an integer, creating a list of digits.
5. `[arr[i]]` creates a list containing the element at index `i` in `arr`.
6. The two lists are concatenated using the `+` operator to form `nums`.

Therefore, the new list `nums` is constructed as follows:
- The first part of `nums` contains the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr`.
- The second part of `nums` contains the integer at index `i` in `arr`.

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, plus the new value of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**
