### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum sum of a subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum subarray sum in linear time.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum (`t`), we can repeatedly add this sum to the total sum of the array to maximize the result.
   - The initial sum of the array (`s`) plus the maximum subarray sum (`t`) gives the base value for the first operation.
   - For subsequent operations, the maximum subarray sum (`t`) is doubled and added to the result, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.
   - **Initial Sum Calculation**: It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
   - **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: It uses a loop to find the maximum subarray sum (`t`) using a similar approach to Kadane's algorithm.
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - The initial result is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
     - For each subsequent operation, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to the result, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Output**: The final result is printed for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles negative sums and ensures that the result is always non-negative by using the expression `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - It correctly handles the case where the array is entirely negative by setting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative, ensuring that the maximum subarray sum is non-negative.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in \(O(n)\) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output format correctly, and the algorithm used is appropriate for the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
