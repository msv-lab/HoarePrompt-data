The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. The loop iterates `m - 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `m - 2` is positive.

State: **`_` is 1, `m` is greater than 2**
