The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This operation updates the values of `a` and `x` based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `r` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1)
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set
- Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`, and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` and `x` are updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`, and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2.**
