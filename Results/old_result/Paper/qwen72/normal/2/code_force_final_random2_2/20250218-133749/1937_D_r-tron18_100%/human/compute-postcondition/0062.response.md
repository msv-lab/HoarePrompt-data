To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to the variable `zeroInd`.
   - The values of `el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - All other variables retain their initial values.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**
