Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is the input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2])], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as it is the input integer and is not modified within the loop.
- **`line`**: Remains unchanged as it is the input string and is not modified within the loop.
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is a list of integers derived from `line` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` starts with `[1000]` and grows with each iteration of the loop. After `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **`result`**: This is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces. The final value of `result` will reflect the contents of `a` after all iterations of the loop.
