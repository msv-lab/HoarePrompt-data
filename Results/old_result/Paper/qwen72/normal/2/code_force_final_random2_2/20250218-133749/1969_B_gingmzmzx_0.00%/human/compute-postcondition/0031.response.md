The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, and `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `c` can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`.**
