The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `i` is set to 2.
  - `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
  - The condition checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the condition is met. Otherwise, the absolute difference is odd.

- **Code Execution**:
  - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It always prints the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
