The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. 

- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is updated to `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0 or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1. Since `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.
- `cnt[0]` is 0.

Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - 0`, which is simply `zeroes`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is [0, 1], `ans` is `zeroes`, `c` is 1**.
