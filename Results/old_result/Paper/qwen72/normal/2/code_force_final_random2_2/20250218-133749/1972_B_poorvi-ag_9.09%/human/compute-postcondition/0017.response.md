The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains one additional element, which is `'no'`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no' followed by an additional 'no', `arr` is an input string.**
