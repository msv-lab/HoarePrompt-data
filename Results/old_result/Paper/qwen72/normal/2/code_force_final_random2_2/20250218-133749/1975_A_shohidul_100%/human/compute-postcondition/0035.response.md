To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `check_all` is False.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False.
   - `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
