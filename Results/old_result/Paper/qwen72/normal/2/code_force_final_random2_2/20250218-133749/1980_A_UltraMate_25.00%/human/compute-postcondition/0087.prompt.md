Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'F'. `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is a variable that will take the value of each key in `hmp` during the loop iterations, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
