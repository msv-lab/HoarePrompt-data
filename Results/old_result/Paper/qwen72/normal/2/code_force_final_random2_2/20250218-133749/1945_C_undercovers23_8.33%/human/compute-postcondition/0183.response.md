The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least two elements, and `ele` should be the second element in `lst`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`.**
