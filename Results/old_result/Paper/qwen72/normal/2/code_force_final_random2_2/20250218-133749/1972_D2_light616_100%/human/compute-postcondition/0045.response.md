To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

### Current State:
- `n` is at least 20.
- `x` and `y` are integers.
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.
- `y` is increased by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `(x + y) * x <= n`**
   - This condition depends on `x`, `y`, and `n`.
   - Since `y` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the value of `(x + y) * x` will increase.
   - To ensure this condition remains true, `n` must be large enough to accommodate the new value of `(x + y) * x`.

2. **Condition 2: `(x + y) * y <= m`**
   - This condition depends on `x`, `y`, and `m`.
   - Similarly, since `y` is increased by 1, the value of `(x + y) * y` will increase.
   - To ensure this condition remains true, `m` must be large enough to accommodate the new value of `(x + y) * y`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
- Since `y` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that the new values of `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` still satisfy the conditions.
- Therefore, `n` and `m` must be large enough to allow the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
Given that `n` is at least 20 and `y` is increased by 1, the loop can execute one more time if `n` and `m` are sufficiently large to satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

State: **`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers, `y` is increased by 1, and `n` and `m` must be large enough to satisfy `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`**.
