#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
def func():
    loop = int(input())

        less = []
        
        big = []

        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)

            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is the final calculated value based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints where `a` is 1, `less` for constraints where `a` is 2, and `no` for constraints where `a` is 3. It then calculates the number of valid solutions (`num`) that satisfy the conditions: `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting for any values in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. The function prints the number of valid solutions for each test case. If no valid solutions exist for a test case, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged.
