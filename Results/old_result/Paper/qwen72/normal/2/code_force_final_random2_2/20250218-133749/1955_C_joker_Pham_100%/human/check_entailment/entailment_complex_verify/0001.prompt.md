You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` being greater than `r` or `k` being 0. The variable `sunks` will contain the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. The values of `a` will be modified according to the operations performed within the loop, potentially reducing some elements to 0 or altering their values based on the conditions checked. The values of `n` and `k` will remain unchanged from their initial values, except for `k` which may be reduced as per the operations inside the loop.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. This count is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by repeatedly reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function terminates when either the entire list has been processed or `k` is exhausted. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some of its elements reduced to 0 or altered, and the function returns the total count of elements that have been fully processed (reduced to 0 or removed). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, except for `k` which may be reduced as a result of the operations performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, in which case it breaks out of the loop.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks the ship and increments `sunks`.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` accordingly.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar checks and updates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship or when `k` is insufficient to sink any more ships.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
