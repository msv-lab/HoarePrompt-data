Postcondition: ***`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + n - 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.***
