The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `False`. This changes the value of `ans` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The list `nums` is not sorted.**
