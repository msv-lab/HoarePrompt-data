Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the values returned by `func_2()` to the list `bonuses`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `neg_prices` are not affected by this line of code.
- The lists `heap`, `remaining_items`, and `combined` remain empty.
- The variables `current_profit` and `max_profit` retain their descriptions as the final profit after processing all items and the maximum profit observed during the loop execution, respectively.
