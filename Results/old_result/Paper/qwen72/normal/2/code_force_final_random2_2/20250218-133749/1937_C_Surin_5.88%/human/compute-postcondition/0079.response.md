Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `prev` to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `prev` while keeping the rest of the variables the same.
