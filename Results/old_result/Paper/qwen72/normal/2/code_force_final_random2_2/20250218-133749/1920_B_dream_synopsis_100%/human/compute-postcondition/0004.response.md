Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers.** 

The list `a` was originally sorted, and now it is reversed, meaning the order of elements in `a` is inverted. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`) remain unchanged.
