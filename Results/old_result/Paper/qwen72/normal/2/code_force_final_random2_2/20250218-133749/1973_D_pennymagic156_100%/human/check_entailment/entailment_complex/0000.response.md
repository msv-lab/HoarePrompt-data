Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading the values of `n` and `k` using `func_3()`. This is correct as it aligns with the problem statement where `n` and `k` are provided as input.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The function then enters a loop to find the maximum value `v` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `r`. This is done by querying the smallest `r` for each `i * n` and checking if `v` equals `n`.
   - If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to the current `i` and breaks out of the loop. This step is crucial for finding the maximum possible value `m` that can be used to split the array.

3. **Splitting the Array**:
   - After finding `v`, the function attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has a value of `i * v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to perform queries and check if the subarrays can be formed. If successful, it prints the result and returns.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid split, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where no valid split is found by printing `-1`.
   - The function also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the allowed limit by carefully managing the loop conditions.

5. **Interactive Queries**:
   - The function correctly uses `print` with `flush=True` to ensure that the queries are sent to the judge and the responses are read using `func_2()`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The function prints the final result and reads the response from the judge to confirm the correctness of the answer.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_5` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, performs the necessary queries, and outputs the correct result based on the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
