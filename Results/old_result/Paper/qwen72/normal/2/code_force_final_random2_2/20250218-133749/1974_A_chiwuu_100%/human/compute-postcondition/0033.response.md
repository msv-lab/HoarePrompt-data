Output State: **`a` is an integer, `t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `b`, `t1`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
