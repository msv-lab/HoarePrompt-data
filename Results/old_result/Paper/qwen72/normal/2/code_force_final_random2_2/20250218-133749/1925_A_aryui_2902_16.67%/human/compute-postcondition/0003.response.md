The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`. The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case provides a new pair of `n` and `k`. For each test case, `n` represents the length of the string to be generated, and `k` represents the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to 26. The function returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26`. It returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times for each test case.**
