The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the inputs and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Specifically, it computes a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) and \( q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \), simplifies the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, and then prints the modular inverse of the simplified fraction. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
