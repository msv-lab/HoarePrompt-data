The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `char` is '+', `count` is 1, and otherwise `count` remains 0, the new value of `count` will be 2 if `char` is '+', and 1 if `char` is '-'.

Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 2, `char` is the second character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.
