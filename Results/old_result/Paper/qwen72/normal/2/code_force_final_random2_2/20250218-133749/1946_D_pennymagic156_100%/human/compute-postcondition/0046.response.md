The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least two elements.
   - `val` is the second element in `a`.
   - `i` is an integer (its value is not specified, but it is assumed to be within the range of valid bit positions for the integers in `a`).

2. **Bitwise Operation Explanation:**
   - `val >> i`: This shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
   - `val >> i & 1`: This takes the result of the right shift and performs a bitwise AND with 1, which isolates the least significant bit of the shifted value.
   - `op ^= val >> i & 1`: This performs a bitwise XOR between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`, and assigns the result back to `op`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `op` is updated based on the result of the bitwise operation.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, and `val` remain unchanged.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `op` is now the result of `op` XORed with the least significant bit of `val` shifted right by `i` positions.
   - The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `val`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least two elements, `val` is the second element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**.
