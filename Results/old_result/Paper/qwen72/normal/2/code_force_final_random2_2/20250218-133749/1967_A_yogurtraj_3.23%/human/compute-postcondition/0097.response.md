Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1.
- Therefore, `rem` is `k % 1`, which is always 0 because any number modulo 1 is 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
