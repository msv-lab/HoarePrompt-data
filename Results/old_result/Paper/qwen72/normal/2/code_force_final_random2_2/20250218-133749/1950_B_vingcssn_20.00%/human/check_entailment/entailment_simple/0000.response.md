Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by handling specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). However, the problem description specifies that \( n \) can be any integer between 1 and 20, inclusive. The program fails to handle cases where \( n > 4 \), which means it does not generate the correct checkerboard for these values of \( n \).

Additionally, the program prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") for any \( n \) outside the hardcoded cases. This is incorrect because the problem requires the program to generate a checkerboard for any valid \( n \) (1 to 20), not to print an error message.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
