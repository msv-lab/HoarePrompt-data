The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `sumo` was initially set to `prod // a[bets - 1]`.
- `a[i]` is now equal to `prod // a[i]`.

The new value of `sumo` will be the previous value of `sumo` plus the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is currently equal to `bets`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[bets]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `sumo` is `prod // a[bets - 1] + prod // a[bets]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is now equal to `prod // a[bets - 1] + prod // a[bets]`, `a[bets - 1]` is now equal to `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `a[bets]` is now equal to `prod // a[bets]`.**
