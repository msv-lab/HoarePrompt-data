Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` remains 0, `bets` remains an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input but now each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]` (where `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`), `prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`. Additionally, the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a` (`prod`).**
