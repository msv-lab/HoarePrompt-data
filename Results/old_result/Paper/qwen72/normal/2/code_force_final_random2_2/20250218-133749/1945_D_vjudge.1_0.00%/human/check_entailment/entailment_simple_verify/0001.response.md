### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - Moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to simplify the logic for handling positions from the end of the queue.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to accumulate the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` positions to find the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `k` positions.
   - For each position `i` in the range `[n - k, n)`, it calculates the total cost to move to that position and updates the minimum cost.

3. **Code Review**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Reversal of Lists**: Reversing the lists simplifies the logic for calculating the cost of moving to earlier positions.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The loop from `0` to `n - k` ensures that Kirill considers moving to positions within the first `k` positions.
     - The inner logic correctly updates `pref` and `soma_b` to account for the minimum cost.
     - The final loop from `n - k` to `n` calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the first `k` positions.
   - **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are small or large within the given constraints.
   - The use of `float('inf')` ensures that the initial value of `resultado` is set to a high value, which is necessary for finding the minimum cost.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Reversal of Lists**:
  - The reversal of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is a clever optimization to simplify the logic. This allows the algorithm to start from the end of the queue and work backwards, which is more intuitive for this problem.

- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The first loop (`for i in range(n - k)`) correctly accumulates the cost of moving to positions within the first `k` positions.
  - The second loop (`for i in range(n - k, n)`) correctly calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the first `k` positions by considering the current accumulated cost (`soma_b`) and the cost of moving to the current position (`lista_A[i]`).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles the case where `n` is equal to `k` correctly. In this case, the first loop does not run, and the second loop directly calculates the minimum cost.
  - The code also handles the case where `n` is much larger than `k` by efficiently accumulating the costs and finding the minimum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

Final: **True**
