You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The variable `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`. The variable `char` is the last character of `s`. The variable `balance` is 0 because the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. The variable `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(balance, -i, char)` representing the balance at that point, the negative index, and the character itself.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-empty, balanced parentheses sequence from the input, processes it, and prints a transformed version of the sequence. The transformation involves maintaining a balance count of parentheses and recording details about each character. After processing, the function sorts these details and constructs a new string from the sorted data, which is then printed. The final state of the program includes the original string `s` remaining unchanged, and the printed output being a potentially reordered version of the original balanced parentheses sequence.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence up to each character. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, negative index, and character in a list called `details`. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

5. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `s` directly from the standard input, which is appropriate for the given problem description.

6. **Output**: The program prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the steps required to produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
