The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over a fixed range from 0 to 19 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is extended to include the value `1`, and `j` is 1.**
