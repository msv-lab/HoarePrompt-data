### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`). For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array itself (`case`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The condition `if num2 > 10000` is indeed problematic. The problem statement does not specify any special handling for large arrays, and this condition introduces an arbitrary behavior that is not aligned with the problem requirements. This condition should be removed.

3. **Array Parsing**: The array is correctly parsed from the input string using list comprehension and filtering out non-digit characters.

4. **Sorting and Median Calculation**:
   - The array is sorted (`b = sorted(a)`).
   - The median index is calculated based on whether the length of the array is even or odd.
   - The current median is stored in `median`.

5. **Increasing the Median**:
   - A loop is used to increment the value at the median index until the new median is greater than the original median.
   - The number of operations (`op`) is incremented each time the value is increased.
   - The array is re-sorted after each increment to ensure the new median is correctly identified.

6. **Output**: The number of operations required to increase the median is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The condition `if num2 > 10000` is not necessary and incorrect. It should be removed.
- **Re-sorting**: Re-sorting the array in each iteration of the loop is inefficient. However, since the array is only modified at the median index, re-sorting is not strictly necessary. We can directly increment the median value and count the operations without re-sorting.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for _ in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = num2 // 2 - 1
        else:
            ma = num2 // 2
        
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        op = 0
        
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            new_median = b[ma]
        
        print(op)
```

### Correctness:
The original program has issues with the edge case handling and inefficiency in re-sorting the array. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
