The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n` as input. It processes the string `s` to create two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` contains characters from `s` that were present in a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets at the time they were processed. If the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in the set when the loop reached it, it is added to `s2`; otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the value of `s2`.
