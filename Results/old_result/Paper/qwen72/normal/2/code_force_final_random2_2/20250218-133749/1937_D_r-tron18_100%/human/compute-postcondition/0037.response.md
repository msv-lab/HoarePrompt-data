Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `ol` and `zr` are updated to `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1` respectively.
- All other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `ol` and `zr` are directly assigned from `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively.
