To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `mak` is 0 or `len(pans)`.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=".
- `i` is `len(pans)`.
- `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`.
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, but no other variables have been modified.
- If the user input is "<", `mak` is set to `len(pans)`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(pans)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(pans) + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `len(pans) + 1` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`mak` is 0 or `len(pans)`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `len(pans) + 1`.**
