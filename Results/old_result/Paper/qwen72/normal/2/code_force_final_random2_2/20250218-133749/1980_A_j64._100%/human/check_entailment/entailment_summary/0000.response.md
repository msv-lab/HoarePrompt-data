Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the string `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the counts of 'A' to 'G') and iterates over the string `a` to populate this list with the frequency of each character.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The function then iterates over the `count` list to determine how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems per difficulty level. If the count for any difficulty level is less than `m`, the difference is added to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of additional problems needed.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, correctly calculating the number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
