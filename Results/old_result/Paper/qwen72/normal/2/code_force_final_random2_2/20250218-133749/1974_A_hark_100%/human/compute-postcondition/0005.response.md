Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` is greater than 0, `ap` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, and `bxsfory`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `t` is an integer within the specified range, `y` is greater than 0, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0, are still valid.
- `bxsfory` remains the ceiling of `y / 2`.
