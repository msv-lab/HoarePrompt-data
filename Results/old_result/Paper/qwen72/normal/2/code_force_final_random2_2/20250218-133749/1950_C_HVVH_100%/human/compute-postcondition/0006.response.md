Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` are integers representing the minute from the input string respectively.**

Explanation: The code snippet `day = 'AM'` sets the variable `day` to 'AM'. Since `day` was already set to 'AM' in the initial state, there is no change in the value of `day`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
