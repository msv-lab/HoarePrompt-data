The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to the range limit, which is 20. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and it must still be less than 20 for the loop to continue.

State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is extended by appending `1` to it, and `j` is 1.**
