The code reads an integer value from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This value represents the number of test cases.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007.**
