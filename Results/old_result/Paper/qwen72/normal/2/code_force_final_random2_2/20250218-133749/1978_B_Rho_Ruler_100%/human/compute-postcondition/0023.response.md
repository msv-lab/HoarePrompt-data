Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` to the variable `profit_next`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_mid`) remain unchanged.
- The new variable `profit_next` now holds the result of the function `func_1` evaluated at `mid + 1` with the same parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`.
