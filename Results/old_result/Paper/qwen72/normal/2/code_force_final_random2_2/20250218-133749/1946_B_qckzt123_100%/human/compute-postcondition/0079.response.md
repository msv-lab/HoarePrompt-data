Output State: **`t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t % MOD) * 2`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `(t % MOD) * 2`.
- The value of `tmp` remains the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` must still be greater than 2.
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `t` to its current value. The new value of `ans` is `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t % MOD) * 2`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
