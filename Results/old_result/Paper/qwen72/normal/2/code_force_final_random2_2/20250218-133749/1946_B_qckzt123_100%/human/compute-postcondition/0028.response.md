The code snippet `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `t` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` was initially `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- `t` is `(2 * t) % MOD`.

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` will be `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD`.

All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2 * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD`, `i` is 0.**
