To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 49\).
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `m` is an input integer such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `ans` is a boolean variable that starts as `True`.

### Logic:
- The variable `ans` is set to `True` initially.
- The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 (i.e., `i = 1`).
- For each iteration, it checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and if the list `nums` is not sorted.
- If both conditions are met, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
- If the loop completes without breaking, `ans` remains `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement uses a list with two elements: `'NO'` and `'YES'`.
- The index `[ans]` is used to select between these two elements.
- If `ans` is `True`, the index `[True]` is equivalent to `[1]`, so `'YES'` is selected.
- If `ans` is `False`, the index `[False]` is equivalent to `[0]`, so `'NO'` is selected.

### Final Output:
- If the list `arr` remains sorted throughout all iterations, `ans` will be `True`, and the output will be `'YES'`.
- If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the list `nums` is not sorted, `ans` will be `False`, and the output will be `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'YES' if the list `arr` remains sorted throughout all iterations, otherwise 'NO'**.
