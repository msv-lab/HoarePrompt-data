Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
