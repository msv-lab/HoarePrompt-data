The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `palka`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `palka`.

State: **`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value that is incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `d`, or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `d`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is a list that now contains the third element of `palka` (if it was not already present). `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, and `i` is in `pl` if it was not already present.**
