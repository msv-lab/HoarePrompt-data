Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times as specified by the loop head `for _ in range(2)`.
- After the loop completes its execution, the list `a` will contain exactly 2 input strings, as it appends one input string per iteration.
- The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- Therefore, the final state after the loop finishes executing is that `a` contains 2 input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.
