Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints where `a` is 1, `less` for constraints where `a` is 2, and `no` for constraints where `a` is 3. It then calculates the number of valid solutions (`num`) that satisfy the conditions: `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting for any values in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. The function prints the number of valid solutions for each test case. If no valid solutions exist for a test case, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged. **
