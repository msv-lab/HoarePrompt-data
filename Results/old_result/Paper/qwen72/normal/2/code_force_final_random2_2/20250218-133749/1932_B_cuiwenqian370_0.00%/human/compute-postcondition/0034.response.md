Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path` containing space-separated integers. The function calls another function `func_1` with the `path` for each test case and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value directly but outputs the results of `func_1` for each test case. **
