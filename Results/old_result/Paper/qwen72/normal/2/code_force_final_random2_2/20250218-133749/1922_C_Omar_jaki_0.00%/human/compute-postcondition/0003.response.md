The value of `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `queries`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the start and end cities for each query. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads input and returns a map object of integers.**
