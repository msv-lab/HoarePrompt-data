Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
7 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

### Actual Output:
```
2
YES
6 1
```

### Explanation:
- The program sets up only 2 stalls with prices `[6, 1]`.
- Alice has 7 coins.
- At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel (spending 6 coins), leaving her with 1 coin.
- At the second stall, Alice cannot buy any more jewels because she only has 1 coin left, which is not enough to buy a jewel priced at 1 coin (since she needs at least 1 coin to buy a jewel).

Thus, Alice ends up buying only 1 jewel instead of the required 3 jewels. This shows that the program does not correctly handle this case, making it incorrect.
