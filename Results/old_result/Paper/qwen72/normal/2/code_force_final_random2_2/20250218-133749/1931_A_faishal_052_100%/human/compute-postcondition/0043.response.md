The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order based on the first element of each sublist. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `cases` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `info` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `j` is 1 (unchanged).
- `arr` is one of the following: `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]` depending on the initial value of `lex`.

### Sorting Analysis:
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`, the sorted `arr` will be:
  - `[1, 1, lex]` and `[1, 26, lex]` will come before `[26, 1, lex]` and `[26, 26, lex]`.
  - The exact order of `[1, 1, lex]` and `[1, 26, lex]` depends on the second element, which is 1 and 26 respectively.
  - The exact order of `[26, 1, lex]` and `[26, 26, lex]` depends on the second element, which is 1 and 26 respectively.

Given the initial state, the possible sorted `arr` could be:
- `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`
- `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`
- `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`
- `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]`

Since the exact initial `arr` is not specified, we can generalize the sorted `arr` as:
- `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]` (or any permutation of the last two elements).

### Output State:
- `cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `info` is an empty list.
- `j` is 1.
- `arr` is sorted as `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]` (or any permutation of the last two elements).

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted as `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, `[26, 26, lex]` (or any permutation of the last two elements).**
