Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (999 - T[0]) - T[1], 999 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it now ranges from -1 to 10^4 - 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
