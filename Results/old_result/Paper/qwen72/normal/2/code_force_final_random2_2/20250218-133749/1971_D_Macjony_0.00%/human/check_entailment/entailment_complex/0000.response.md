Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Count Initialization**: It initializes a variable `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.

3. **Flag Initialization**: A boolean variable `flag` is initialized to `False`. This flag is used to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string.

4. **Loop Through String**: The function iterates through the string `s` using a while loop. For each character `s[j]`:
   - If `s[j]` is different from `s[j + 1]`, it increments `count` because a transition between different characters indicates a potential cut.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character (since it has already been counted).

5. **Adjust Count**: After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This adjustment is necessary because the presence of at least one '0' followed by '1' means that the last transition counted might not be necessary for the final sorted string.

6. **Output Result**: The function prints the value of `count` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correct Handling of Transitions**: The function correctly counts the number of transitions between different characters in the string.
- **Adjustment for '0' to '1' Transition**: The adjustment for the presence of '0' followed by '1' ensures that the final count is minimized correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as strings with no transitions (e.g., "00000000") and strings with a single character (e.g., "1").

### Test Cases:
- **"11010"**: The transitions are at positions 2 and 3, giving `count = 3`.
- **"00000000"**: No transitions, so `count = 1`.
- **"1"**: No transitions, so `count = 1`.
- **"10"**: One transition, so `count = 2`.
- **"0001111"**: No transitions, so `count = 1`.
- **"0110"**: Two transitions, but one is from '0' to '1', so `count = 2`.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to handle all the test cases correctly and follows the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
