Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is a list containing `[a]`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing `[a, a]`.***
