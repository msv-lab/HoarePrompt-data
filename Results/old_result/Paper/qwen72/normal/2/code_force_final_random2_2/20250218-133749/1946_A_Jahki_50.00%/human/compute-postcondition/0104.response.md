Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0. If `num2` > 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the loop started, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the loop has completed, `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + op`, and `op` is the number of times the loop executed.**
