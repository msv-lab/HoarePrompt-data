The value of `soma_b` is incremented by the value of `lista_B[i]`. The value of `i` is `n - k + 2`, and since `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is a valid index for `lista_B`. The value of `resultado` remains the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 2]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 2]`, `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[n - k + 2]`**
