### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case to read the value of `n`.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - The function generates the correct checkerboard patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` as specified in the problem description.
   - However, the function fails to handle values of `n` greater than 4. According to the problem constraints, `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20.

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` are correct and match the expected output.
   - For any other value of `n`, the function prints "No esta en el rango", which is incorrect because the problem specifies that `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The function lacks a general approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is not scalable or correct for all possible inputs.
   - A correct implementation should dynamically generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the range 1 to 20.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle all valid inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and only provides specific hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
