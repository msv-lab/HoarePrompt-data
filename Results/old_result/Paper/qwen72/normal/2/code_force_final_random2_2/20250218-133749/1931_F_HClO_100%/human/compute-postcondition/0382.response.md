Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`), `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the next tuple in `val`, `_` is `m - 3`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`), `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
