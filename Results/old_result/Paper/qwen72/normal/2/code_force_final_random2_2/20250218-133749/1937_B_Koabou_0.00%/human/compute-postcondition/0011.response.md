To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `a` is a list containing two input strings
- The loop has executed 2 times
- `s` is an empty list
- `x` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than 1.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0 (the starting value of the range function).

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 1 to make the loop execute.
- Set `i` to 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` remains a list containing two input strings
- The loop has executed 2 times (this information is not relevant to the loop head)
- `s` remains an empty list
- `x` remains 0
- `i` is 0

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `i` is 0**
