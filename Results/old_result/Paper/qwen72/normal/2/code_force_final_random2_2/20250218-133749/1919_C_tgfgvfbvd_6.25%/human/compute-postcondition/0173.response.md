Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists) and must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and the element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the element at index `x` in the list `l`.***
