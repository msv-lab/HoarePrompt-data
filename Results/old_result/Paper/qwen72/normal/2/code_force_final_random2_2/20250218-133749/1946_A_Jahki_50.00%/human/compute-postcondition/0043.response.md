The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `16668`. The initial state provides several variables and their conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the value being printed by the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 to 10^9.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is a new input string.
- `op` is 0.

None of these variables or conditions influence the `print` statement, which simply prints the constant integer `16668`.

Output: **16668**
