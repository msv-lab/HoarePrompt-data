Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n \cdot (n - 1) / 2\). The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the output was either `n` if `n - k <= 1` or `1` otherwise.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` were integers read from the input, with `n` in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `k` in the range \(0 \leq k \leq n \cdot (n - 1) / 2\).
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- For each iteration, the output was determined by the condition: if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the output was `n`; otherwise, the output was `1`.
