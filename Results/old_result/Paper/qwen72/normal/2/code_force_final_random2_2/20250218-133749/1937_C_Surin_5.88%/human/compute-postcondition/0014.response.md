The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values.**
