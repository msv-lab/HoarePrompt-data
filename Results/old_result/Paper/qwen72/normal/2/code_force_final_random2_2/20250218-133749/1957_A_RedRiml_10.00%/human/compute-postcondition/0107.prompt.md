Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value that is incremented by 1 (if `i` already exists in `d`) or set to 1 (if `i` does not exist in `d`), `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, and `i` is in `pl` if it was not already present.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value that is incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `d`, or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `d`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is a list that now contains the second element of `palka` (if it was not already present). `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, and `i` is in `pl` if it was not already present.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value that is incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `d`, or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `d`. `pl` is a list that contains the third element of `palka` if it was not already present, and `i` is appended to `pl` if it was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, and `i` is in `pl` if it was not already present.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
