Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is the minimum value between the new `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)`, `t` is `t + n * s`, `k` is `k - (n-1) * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The list `l` is sorted in ascending order.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, `t`) retain their previously calculated or provided values, except for the changes due to the sorting of `l`.
