The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The previous value of `index` was `3 + n`, so after the increment, `index` becomes `3 + n + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2*n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
