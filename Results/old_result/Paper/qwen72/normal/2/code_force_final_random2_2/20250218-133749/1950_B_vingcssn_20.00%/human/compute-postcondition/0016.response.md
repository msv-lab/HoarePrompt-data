The given `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints a fixed string.

Here's the breakdown:
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is currently 3.
- `n` is not equal to 1 or 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('..##..')
```

This statement will print the string `..##..` regardless of the values of `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Output: **..##..**
