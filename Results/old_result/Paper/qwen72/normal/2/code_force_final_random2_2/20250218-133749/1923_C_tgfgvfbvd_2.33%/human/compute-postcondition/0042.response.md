Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed). For each iteration, `a` and `b` were integers provided by user input. The value of `s` was calculated as the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, adjusted by subtracting `p[a-2]` if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` was checked, and 'YES' was printed if the condition was met; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `m` is now 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The variables `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial values. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were provided by user input, and the value of `s` was computed based on the cumulative sums in `p`. The loop checked whether the subarray from index `a` to `b-1` had a sum `s` that was at least twice its length, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
