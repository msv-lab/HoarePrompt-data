Initial State: `n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Code:
```
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Step-by-step calculation:
1. `x` is 1 and `y` is 2.
2. `(x + y)` is `1 + 2`, which equals 3.
3. `((x + y) * x)` is `3 * 1`, which equals 3.
4. `((x + y) * y)` is `3 * 2`, which equals 6.
5. `n // 3` is calculated, where `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3.
6. `m // 6` is calculated, where `m` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 6.
7. `min(n // 3, m // 6)` is determined.
8. `cnt` is incremented by the result of `min(n // 3, m // 6)`.

Since `n` is at least 3 and `m` is at least 6:
- The minimum value of `n // 3` is 1 (when `n` is 3).
- The minimum value of `m // 6` is 1 (when `m` is 6).

Therefore, `min(n // 3, m // 6)` is at least 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.**
