Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then processing each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation list in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1.
   - The loop iterates over `k` positions, and for each position, it fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current position with the next available value of `curr_v`.

3. **Correctness of the Permutation**:
   - The permutation is constructed such that the values are distributed in a way that ensures the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` are as close as possible.
   - The condition `\max(s) - \min(s) \le 1` is satisfied because the values are distributed evenly across the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the permutation as a space-separated string, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values within the given constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
