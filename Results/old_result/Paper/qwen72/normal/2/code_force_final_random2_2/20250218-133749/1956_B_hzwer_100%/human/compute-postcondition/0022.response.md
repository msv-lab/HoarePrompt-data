Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
