Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes the list `a` according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`, creating a new list `b` where elements from `a` are appended to `b` from the left or right end based on the characters in `s`. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of `b`. The final state of the program is that the function returns a list of cumulative products corresponding to the elements in `b`. **
