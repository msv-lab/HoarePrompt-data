You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `s` was a string input by the user. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` was 1, the program printed 'NO'. If the length of `a` was greater than 1, the program printed 'YES', and then it printed either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or in descending order, depending on whether `s` was already sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string has a length of at most 10 and consists of lowercase English letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
