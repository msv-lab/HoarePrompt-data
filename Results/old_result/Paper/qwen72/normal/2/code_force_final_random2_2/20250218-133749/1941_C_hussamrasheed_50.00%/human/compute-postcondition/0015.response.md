The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
