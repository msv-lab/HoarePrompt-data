To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is an integer input by the user.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\). This means `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged (not relevant to the length calculation).
   - `ans` is initially constructed as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

2. **Construction of `ans`:**
   - The list `ans` starts with three elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - The list `ans` is then extended by appending `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19, except for `i`.

3. **Counting the Elements in `ans`:**
   - Initially, `ans` has 3 elements.
   - We append `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19, which is a total of 20 elements.
   - However, one of these 20 elements (specifically `1 << i`) is not appended because it is excluded.

4. **Total Number of Elements in `ans`:**
   - Initial elements: 3
   - Appended elements: 20 - 1 = 19
   - Total elements: 3 + 19 = 22

Therefore, the length of the `ans` list is 22.

Output: **22**
