You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed into the function `func_2`. However, the function expects input from stdin where the first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, k, and d representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The subsequent n lines contain m space-separated integers representing the depths of the river cells in each row.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every contiguous subsequence of k elements in the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, representing the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. The next `n` lines contain `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The function processes this input but the specific output or return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
