To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2.
- `k` must be a positive integer.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the variables in the `print` statement:
- `l` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that exists in the context where this code is running.

Given the information:
- `l` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `v` is an unknown variable, but it must be defined in the context where this code is running.

The `print` statement will format the string with the values of `l` and `i * v`. Since `l` is 1 and `i` is 2, the output will be:
- `? 1 2 * v`

Since `v` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is a variable that must be defined in the context.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 [2 * v] (where v is the value of the variable v)**
