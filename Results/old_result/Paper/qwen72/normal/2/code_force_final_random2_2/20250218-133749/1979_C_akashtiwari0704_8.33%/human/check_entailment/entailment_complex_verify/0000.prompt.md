You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. The variable `T` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `bets` was an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` was a list of integers read from the user's input, and each element `a[i]` was updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. The variable `prod` was the product of all elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` for each iteration. The variable `i` was `bets - 1` at the end of each iteration, and `sumo` was the sum of the updated elements in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`. If `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod` for any iteration, `-1` was printed. Otherwise, a string `ans` containing all elements of the updated `a` list separated by spaces was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of outcomes and their respective multipliers. For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers and then updates each multiplier to the product divided by the original multiplier. It sums these updated multipliers and checks if the sum is less than the product. If so, it prints the updated multipliers as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` unchanged, but the internal variables used in the function (like `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans`) are no longer accessible.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. This approach does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
27 41 12
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
- The program calculates `prod` as \(3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\).
- It then sets the bets as \(a[0] = 42 / 3 = 14\), \(a[1] = 42 / 2 = 21\), and \(a[2] = 42 / 7 = 6\).
- The sum of the bets is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\).
- The program checks if \(41 \geq 42\) and prints `-1` because the condition is true.

However, a valid solution exists where the bets are \(27, 41, 12\), and the total sum of bets is \(27 + 41 + 12 = 80\). For each winning outcome:
- If the first outcome wins, you get \(3 \times 27 = 81\) coins.
- If the second outcome wins, you get \(2 \times 41 = 82\) coins.
- If the third outcome wins, you get \(7 \times 12 = 84\) coins.

All these values are strictly greater than 80, which satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to find a valid solution in this case.
