Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'. `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `n` is odd. If the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no'.***
