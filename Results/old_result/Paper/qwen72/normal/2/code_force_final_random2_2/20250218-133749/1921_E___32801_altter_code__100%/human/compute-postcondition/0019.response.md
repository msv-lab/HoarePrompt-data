Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` with specific constraints on their values.
- `n` is equal to `h`.
- `m` is equal to `w`.
- `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1`.
- `x2` is equal to `x_b`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`.

Given these conditions, the print statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
