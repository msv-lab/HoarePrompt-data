Output State: **`t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans` is now equal to `(((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t % MOD) * 2) % MOD`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` was previously `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t % MOD) * 2`.
- The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`.
- Therefore, `ans` is now `(((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t % MOD) * 2) % MOD`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tmp`, `s`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
