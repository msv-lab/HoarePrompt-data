The provided Python code snippet reads two inputs and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the initial state already defines `a` and `b` as integers, the new values of `a` and `b` will be the integers read from the input.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The line `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`.

2. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are updated to the new integer values read from the input.
   - Other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.

3. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `a` is now the first integer read from the input.
   - `b` is now the second integer read from the input.
   - All other variables retain their initial values.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is set to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
