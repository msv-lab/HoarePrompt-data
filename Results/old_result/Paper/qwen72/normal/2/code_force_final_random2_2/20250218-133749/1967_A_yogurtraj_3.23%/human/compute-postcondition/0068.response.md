The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` modifies the value of `k` based on the current values of `i` and the elements of the list `a`. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is currently 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` calculates the difference between the second and third elements of the list `a` (since `i` is 1), multiplies this difference by 2 (since `i + 1` is 2), and subtracts this result from `k`.

Let's assume the values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` are `a1` and `a2` respectively. The calculation becomes:
- `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) = 2 * (a2 - a1)`

Thus, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a2 - a1)`.

The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `y`, `rem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `k` is now `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**
