The code snippet updates the value of `num` using the formula `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the new value of `num` will be `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `x` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `num` is updated to `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`.
- The condition "If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1" is not affected by this code snippet, so `count` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`, and `count` remains unchanged.**
