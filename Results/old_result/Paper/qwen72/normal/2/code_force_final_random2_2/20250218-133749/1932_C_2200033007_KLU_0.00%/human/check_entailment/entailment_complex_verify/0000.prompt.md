You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1

        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])

        else:

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`. If `s[i] == 'L'`, the element at index `l - 1` from `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] == 'R'`, the element at index `r` from `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented by 1. The final state of `b` will be a permutation of the elements in `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in the original order (not reversed).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes the list `a` according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`, creating a new list `b` where elements from `a` are appended to `b` from the left or right end based on the characters in `s`. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of `b`. The final state of the program is that the function returns a list of cumulative products corresponding to the elements in `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` before removing an element according to the command. Instead, it appends the element to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not match the problem description, which requires computing the remainder of the product of the current state of the array before each removal.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
0 0 0 0
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
- Initial array: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
- Command `L`: 
  - Expected: `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 24 % 6 = 0`
  - Actual: The program appends `3` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `R`:
  - Expected: `1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2`
  - Actual: The program appends `2` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `R`:
  - Expected: `1 * 4 % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4`
  - Actual: The program appends `4` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.
- Command `L`:
  - Expected: `1 % 6 = 1`
  - Actual: The program appends `1` to `b` and later computes the product of `b` in reverse order.

The program fails to correctly compute the remainder of the product of the current state of the array before each removal, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
