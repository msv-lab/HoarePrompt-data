The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given the initial state, `ax` is initially 1000000007, and `x` is an input integer. The new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two values.

Let's evaluate the possible outcomes:

- If `x` is less than 1000000007, then `ax` will be updated to `x`.
- If `x` is greater than or equal to 1000000007, then `ax` will remain 1000000007.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `x`:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer.**
