### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes a variable `x` to keep track of the point where the path switches from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the columns from 0 to `n-2` (since the last column is always included).
   - For each column, it checks if the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0'. If this condition is met, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to the current column and the suffix of the bottom row starting from the current column. It also sets `x` to the current column index and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such switch point is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will store the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the columns up to `x` and checks if the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It then prints the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string seems correct. It correctly identifies the point where switching to the bottom row would result in a smaller string and constructs the string accordingly.
- The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. It correctly counts the number of ways to reach the switch point and the number of ways to continue from there.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
