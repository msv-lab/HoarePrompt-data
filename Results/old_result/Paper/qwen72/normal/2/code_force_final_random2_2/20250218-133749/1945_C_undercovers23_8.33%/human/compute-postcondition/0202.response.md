Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order, but the length of `final` is 0. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, `c1`) remains unchanged, except `c1` which is now equal to `o * 100 // n`.** 

Explanation: The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the integer division of `o * 100` by `n` and assigns the result to `c1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
