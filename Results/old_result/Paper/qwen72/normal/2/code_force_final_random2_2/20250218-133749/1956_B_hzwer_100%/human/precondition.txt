t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The list a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
