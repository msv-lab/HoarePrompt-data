Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is `beautiful_count + freq[(x - num % x) % x, num % y]`, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[(x - num % x) % x, num % y]` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous definitions and values.
