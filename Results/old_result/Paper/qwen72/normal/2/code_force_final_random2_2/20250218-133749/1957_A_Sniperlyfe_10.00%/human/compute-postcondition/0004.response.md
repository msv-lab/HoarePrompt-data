The code updates the frequency count of the second element in the list `arr` within the dictionary `freq`. Initially, `freq` contains the first element of `arr` with a frequency of 1. After executing the code, the frequency of the second element `n` in `arr` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` (the second element in `arr`) and its value is 2, `n` is the second element in `arr`.**
