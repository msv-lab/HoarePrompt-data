### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.
   - The return from the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total bet should be less than the minimum return from any outcome.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and sums up all the bets.
   - If the total sum of bets `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product of all multipliers `prod` is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Distribution:** Each bet `a[i]` is set to `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the return from the i-th outcome is `a[i] * k_i = prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - **Sum Check:** The sum of all bets `sumo` is checked against `prod`. If `sumo >= prod`, it means the total bet is not strictly less than the return from any outcome, and the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Output Format:** The bets are printed in the correct format as required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where a valid distribution exists by printing the bets.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Overflow:** The product of all multipliers `prod` can become very large, potentially causing overflow issues. However, since the constraints are relatively small (`1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20`), the maximum value of `prod` is manageable within the limits of Python's integer type.
   - **Division by Zero:** The division `prod // a[i]` is safe because `a[i]` is guaranteed to be at least 2, so there is no risk of division by zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no valid distribution exists. The algorithm is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
