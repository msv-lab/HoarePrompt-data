Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]], `i` is 2, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` refers to the second element of `a`, which is `1000 - T[0]`.
- `T[i - 1]` refers to the second element of `T`, which is `T[1]`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
