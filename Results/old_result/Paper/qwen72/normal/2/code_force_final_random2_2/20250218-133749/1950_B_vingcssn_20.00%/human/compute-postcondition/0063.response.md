The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c` being less than `casos`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `c` is 1
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive)

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `casos` must still be an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive) and must be greater than `c` for the loop to continue.

State: **`c` is 2, `casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` remains unchanged based on its initial value (1, 2, 3, 4, or any other value).**
