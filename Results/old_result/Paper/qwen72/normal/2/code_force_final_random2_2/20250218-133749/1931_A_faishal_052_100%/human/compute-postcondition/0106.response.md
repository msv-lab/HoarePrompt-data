The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `2` (the upper limit of the range). The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions provided for `lex` and how it affects `info` and `arr`, these values do not change in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. The state of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `arr` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 1, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[1]`, `arr` is `[1]`, and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[]`, and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.**
