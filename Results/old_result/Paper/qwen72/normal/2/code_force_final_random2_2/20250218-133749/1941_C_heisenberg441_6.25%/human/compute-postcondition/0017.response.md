The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` contains the substring 'pie', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 3 (1 ≤ n - 3 ≤ 10^6). `s` is not equal to 'mapie', does not contain the substring 'map', and may or may not contain the substring 'pie'. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 3 (1 ≤ n - 3 ≤ 10^6). `s` is not equal to 'mapie', does not contain the substring 'map', and must contain the substring 'pie'. `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`, plus 1.**
