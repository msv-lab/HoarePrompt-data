Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t_initial + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.***
