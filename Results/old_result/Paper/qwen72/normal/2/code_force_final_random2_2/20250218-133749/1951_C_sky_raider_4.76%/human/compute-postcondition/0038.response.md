Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k) - (n-1) * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations the loop will run.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: After each iteration, `k` is reduced by `min(m, k)`. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced by `n * min(m, k) + (n-1) * min(m, k)`.
- **`l`**: The list `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The value of `s` is set to `min(m, k)` in each iteration, but since `k` decreases, `s` will also decrease over time.
- **`c`**: The value of `c` is updated in each iteration by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. After `n` iterations, `c` will be the sum of these updates for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The final value of `c` can be expressed as `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2 for j in range(n))`.
