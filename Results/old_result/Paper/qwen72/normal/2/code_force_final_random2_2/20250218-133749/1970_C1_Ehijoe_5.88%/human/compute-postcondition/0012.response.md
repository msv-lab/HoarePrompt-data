The code `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the integer `u` to the left side of the deque `tree`. Since `tree` was initially empty, after this operation, `tree` contains only one element, which is `u`. The value of `v` remains equal to the first element of `tree`, which is now `u`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, and the current value of `v` is equal to `u`.**
