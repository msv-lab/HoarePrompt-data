Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, and `func`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
