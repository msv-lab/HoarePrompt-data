Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `gcd` is calculated using the `math.gcd` function, which computes the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
