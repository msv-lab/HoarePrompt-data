The code snippet `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of the element in the list `E` at the index `out_aa` by 1. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The next pair `(in_aa, out_aa)` will be the next elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively. The value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
