Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases, t, is provided at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the last element in the list `l` that was either greater than or equal to the previous `a` or less than the previous `a` but closer to it than `b`, `b` is the last element in the list `l` that was either greater than the previous `b` or less than the previous `b` but closer to it than `a`, `c` is the count of elements in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`, `y` is the index of the element `b` in the list `l` or `n-1` if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the last element in the list `l` that was considered during the loop, `b` is the second last element in the list `l` that was considered during the loop, `c` is the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was met and `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or `l[x] - a < l[x] - b` was true, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed its iterations).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop, `b` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop, `c` is the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
