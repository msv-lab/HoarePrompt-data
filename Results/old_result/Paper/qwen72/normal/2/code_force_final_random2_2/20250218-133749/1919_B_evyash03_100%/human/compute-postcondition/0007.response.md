Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 2, `char` is the second character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.***
