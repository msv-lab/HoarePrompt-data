The code snippet `pairs_in_D -= 1` decrements the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, the value of `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value (which was greater than 0), the value of `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**
