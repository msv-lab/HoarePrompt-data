Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is flawed. The program incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the answer, which does not correspond to the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient solution involves using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and number theory to count the valid pairs more efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly. However, this approach is still inefficient for large inputs. For an optimal solution, you would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm that leverages number theory properties.
