The code snippet modifies the string `s` by removing the first occurrence of the substring 'pie' and the character immediately following it. Since `s` originally contains the substring 'pie' and does not contain the substring 'map', the removal of 'pie' and the next character will reduce the length of `s` by 3 characters.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The length `n` of `s` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
- `s` is not equal to 'mapie'.
- `s` does not contain the substring 'map'.
- `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.
- `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

After executing the code:
- The first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it are removed from `s`.
- The length of `s` is reduced by 3.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged because no 'map' substrings were removed.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 3 (1 ≤ n - 3 ≤ 10^6). `s` is not equal to 'mapie', does not contain the substring 'map', and may or may not contain the substring 'pie'. `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**
