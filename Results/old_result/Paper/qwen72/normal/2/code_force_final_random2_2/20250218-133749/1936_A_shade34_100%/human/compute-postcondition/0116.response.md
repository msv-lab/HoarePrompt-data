The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`mak` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `s` is the new user input string. If `s` is "<", `mak` and `mak2` are both set to 1, and `pans` is [1]. If `s` is not "<" but is either "=" or any other value, `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is "<" or "=", otherwise `pans` is [1]**.
