Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, and `k` is reduced by 2 for each such occurrence. `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration. `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now `n-1`.
- `ans1` contains elements from the list `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, with each duplicate element appended twice to `ans1`.
- `k` is reduced by 2 for each occurrence of consecutive duplicates in `b`.
- `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, as determined during the loop's execution.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
