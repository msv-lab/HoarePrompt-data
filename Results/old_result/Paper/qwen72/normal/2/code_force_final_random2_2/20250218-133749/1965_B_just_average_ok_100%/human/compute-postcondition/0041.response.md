Output State: **If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1, and `i` is 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`. The length of `nums` remains 21, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**
