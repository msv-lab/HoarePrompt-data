Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. The logic in the function `func_1` needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Case when `n` equals `k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` equals `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is a valid solution.
   - Output: `YES\n1\n1`

2. **Case when `n` is less than `k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is less than `k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she does not have enough coins.
   - Output: `NO`

3. **Case when `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and not equal to `k`:**
   - The program sets up a list `costs` with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` accumulates the total number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, the program correctly prints `NO` because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `2`, `YES`, and the elements of `costs`.

However, there is a logical issue in the implementation:
- The program always prints `2` stalls, regardless of whether the calculated `h` is sufficient to buy `k` jewels. This is incorrect because the number of stalls should be printed only if the solution is valid.
- Additionally, the program does not handle the case where more than 2 stalls might be needed to achieve the desired result.

To fix this, the program should:
- Ensure that the number of stalls is printed only if the solution is valid.
- Consider the possibility of needing more than 2 stalls to achieve the desired result.

Given the current implementation, the program does not always produce the correct output for all cases, especially when more than 2 stalls are required.

Correctness: **False**
