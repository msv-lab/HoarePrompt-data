Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `max(0, x // i)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
