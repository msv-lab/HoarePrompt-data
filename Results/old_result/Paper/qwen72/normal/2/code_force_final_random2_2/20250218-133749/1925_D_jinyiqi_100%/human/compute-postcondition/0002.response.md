To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with specific constraints.
- Other variables like `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` have specific constraints.
- The loop iterates over the range of `t`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter and will start from 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.
- The variable `i` should start from 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
