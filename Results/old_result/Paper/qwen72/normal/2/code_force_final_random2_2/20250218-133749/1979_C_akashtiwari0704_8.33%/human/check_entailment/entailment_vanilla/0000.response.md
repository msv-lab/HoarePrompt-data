### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we get back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet should be less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]` and sums up all the bets to get `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product of all multipliers `prod` is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation:** Each bet `a[i]` is set to `prod // a[i]`, which ensures that the total amount bet is `sumo = sum(prod // a[i])`.
   - **Sum Check:** The condition `if sumo >= prod` checks if the total amount bet is greater than or equal to the product of all multipliers. If true, it prints `-1` because it means there is no valid distribution.
   - **Output:** If the condition is false, it prints the bets, which are valid according to the problem constraints.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of bets is equal to or greater than the product of multipliers correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where the number of outcomes is small and the multipliers are large, ensuring that the bets are within the allowed range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and outputs the bets or `-1` as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
