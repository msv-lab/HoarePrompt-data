Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
