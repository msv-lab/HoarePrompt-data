Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order, `suma` is 0.** 

The initial value of `suma` was not specified, but the code snippet sets `suma` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
