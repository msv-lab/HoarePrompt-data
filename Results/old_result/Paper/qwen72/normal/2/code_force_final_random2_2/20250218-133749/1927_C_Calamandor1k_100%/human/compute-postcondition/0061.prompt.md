Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even), followed by two lists of integers a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) of lengths n and m respectively. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, m, k, a, b in cases:
    unique_a = set(a)
    unique_b = set(b)
    relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
    relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
    only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
    only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
    both = relevant_a & relevant_b
    if len(only_a) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if len(only_b) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
    if total_distinct < k:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, the first tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)` where `n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and `b` is a list of integers of length `m` (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6). `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common to both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. If `total_distinct` (the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, the next tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES', 'YES'. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct < k`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop. If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, the program continues to the next line of code, and all variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, the next tuple in `cases` is the second tuple, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES', 'YES', 'YES'. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct < k`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop. If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next line of code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
