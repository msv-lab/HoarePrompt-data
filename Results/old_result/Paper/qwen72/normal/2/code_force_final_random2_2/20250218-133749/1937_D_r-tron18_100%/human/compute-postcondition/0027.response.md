Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list [0, n], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * n - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `oneInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The function `func_1(preOne, zr)` is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and its result is multiplied by 2 to get the value of `oneInd`.
