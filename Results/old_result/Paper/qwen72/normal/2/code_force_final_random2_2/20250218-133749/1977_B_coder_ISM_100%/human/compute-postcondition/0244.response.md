The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(length)
```

Based on the initial state:

- `i` is 29
- `length` is 30
- `nalla` is `t`
- `t` is greater than `t - 1`
- `x` is an input integer
- `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`
- After 29 iterations, any consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` pairs in the list `s` have been transformed such that the `'-1'` is moved one position to the left and becomes `'0'`, and the `'1'` remains unchanged. This transformation continues until no more such pairs exist.

The `print` statement only involves the variable `length`, which is explicitly stated to be 30. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **30**
