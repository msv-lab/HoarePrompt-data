The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution, and the final state is that `t` lines have been printed, each line containing either "Bob" or "Alice" based on the condition evaluated for each test case.
