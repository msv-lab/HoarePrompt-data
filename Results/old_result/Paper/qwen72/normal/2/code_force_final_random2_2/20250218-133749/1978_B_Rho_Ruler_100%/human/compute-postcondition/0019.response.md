Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `low` remains 0 or is updated to `mid + 1` if the condition was previously met. `high` is updated to the minimum of `n` and `b` if `profit_next > profit_mid`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.***
