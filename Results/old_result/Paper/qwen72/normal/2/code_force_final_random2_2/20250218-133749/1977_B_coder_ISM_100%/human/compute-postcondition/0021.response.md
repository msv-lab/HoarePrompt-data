Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` corresponds to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `flag` is initialized to 0.
- The initial state variables `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The list `s` still contains 30 elements, each representing a bit of the binary representation of `x`.
- No other changes occur in the initial state variables.
