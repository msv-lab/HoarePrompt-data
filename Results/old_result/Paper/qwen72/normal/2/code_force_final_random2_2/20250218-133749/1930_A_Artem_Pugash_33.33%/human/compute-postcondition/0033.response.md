Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `b` is `a`, `suma` is `2 * a`, and `numbers` now contains one less element starting from the second element onwards.**

Explanation: The code `suma += min(a, b)` adds the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `suma`. Since `a` and `b` are both equal to the same integer value (the first element of `numbers` before the pop operation), `min(a, b)` is simply `a`. Therefore, `suma` is updated to `suma + a`, which results in `2 * a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
