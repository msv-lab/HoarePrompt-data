The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It reverses both lists and then computes a value `resultado` which is the minimum of a specific calculation involving elements from `lista_A` and `lista_B`. The final value of `resultado` is printed. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed but otherwise remain unchanged. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
