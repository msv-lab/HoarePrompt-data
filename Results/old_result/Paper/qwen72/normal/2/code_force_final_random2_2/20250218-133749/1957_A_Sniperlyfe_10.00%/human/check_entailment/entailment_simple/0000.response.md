Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a given set of sticks. The logic implemented in `func_1` counts the frequency of each stick length and then divides each frequency by 4 (using integer division) to determine how many squares (or other 4-sided polygons) can be formed from sticks of that length. However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers the formation of 4-sided polygons, which is not what the problem statement requires. The problem asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, which can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the formation of polygons with any number of sides (3 or more) and not just 4-sided polygons. For example, if there are 6 sticks of the same length, they can form two triangles (3-sided polygons) instead of one square (4-sided polygon).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
