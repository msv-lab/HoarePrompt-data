The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is set to 2. Otherwise, `num` is set to 4.**
