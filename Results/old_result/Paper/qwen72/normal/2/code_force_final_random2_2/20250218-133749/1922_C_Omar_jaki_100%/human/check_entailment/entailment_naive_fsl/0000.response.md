Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the program uses a list `b` to store cumulative costs but does not correctly account for the cost of traveling to the closest city using 1 coin. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
1 4
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program may produce a different result due to the incorrect handling of the closest city travel cost.

The program should correctly identify the closest city and use the 1-coin travel option when it is cheaper than direct travel. The current implementation does not seem to handle this logic correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
