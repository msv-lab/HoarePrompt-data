Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and contains at least one element, `a` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `b` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, and `numbers` now contains one less element starting from the second element onwards.**
