Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns under the given promotion rules. The solution involves two main functions:

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \). This formula correctly reflects the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The binary search is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a point and then decreases). The function iterates over possible values of `k` and keeps track of the maximum profit found.

The binary search ensures that the function efficiently finds the optimal `k` without checking every possible value, which is crucial given the large upper bounds on `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The overall structure of the program is correct:
- It reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually.
- For each test case, it calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
