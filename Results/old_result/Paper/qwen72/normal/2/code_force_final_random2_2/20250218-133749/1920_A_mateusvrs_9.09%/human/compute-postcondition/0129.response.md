Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.***
