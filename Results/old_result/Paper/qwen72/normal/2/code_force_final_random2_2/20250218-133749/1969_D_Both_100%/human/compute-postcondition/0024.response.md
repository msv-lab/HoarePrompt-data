The code snippet `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)` updates the value of `current_profit` by calling the function `func_3` with the arguments `combined` and `heap`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we assume that `func_3` returns a value that is assigned to `current_profit`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `max_profit` is 0
- `current_profit` is 0
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values. Additionally, `combined` is not empty.

After executing the code snippet:
- `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`

Since the exact value returned by `func_3` is not specified, we represent it as `func_3_result`.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is `func_3_result`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values. Additionally, `combined` is not empty.**
