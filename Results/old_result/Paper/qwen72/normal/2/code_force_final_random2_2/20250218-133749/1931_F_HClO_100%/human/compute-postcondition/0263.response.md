Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
- The first integer from this line is assigned to `a1`.
- The remaining integers are collected into the list `l1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `val`, `idx2`, `l`, `n`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
