The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of other variables such as `cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, or `lex`. The specific values of `arr` depend on the conditions given for `lex`.

Let's consider the different cases for `lex`:

1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex]` since `lex` is already greater than 1.
2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`. Sorting this list will result in `[26, 26, lex]` since `lex` is already greater than 26.
3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`. Sorting this list will result in `[26, 26, lex]` since `lex` is already greater than 26.
4. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[lex]`. Sorting this single-element list will not change it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and `lex` is reduced by 2 if `lex` is less than 28, by 52 if `lex` is between 28 and 78 inclusive, and remains unchanged if `lex` is greater than 78.**
