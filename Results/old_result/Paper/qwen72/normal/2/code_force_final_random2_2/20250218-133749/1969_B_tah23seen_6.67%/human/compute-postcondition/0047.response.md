Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the original `right` position or the length of `s` if no '0' is found, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `left` until it finds the first occurrence of '1' in the list `s` or until `left` reaches the length of `s`.
- After all iterations, `left` will either point to the first '1' in the list `s` or will be equal to the length of `s` if no '1' is found.
- The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `right`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
