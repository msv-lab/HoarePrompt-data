Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`.
- `char` is the last character of `s`.
- `balance` is 0.
- `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, sorted in the order they appear in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(0, -i, char)`.
- `result` is a string equal to `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")".
- `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`.
- `char` is the last character of `s`, which could be either "(" or ")", but since `s` is a balanced sequence, the last character must be ")".
- `balance` is 0, which is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `details` is a list of tuples, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `result` is a string that is equal to `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)**
