### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes `s` as an empty list and sets `x` and `y` to 0.
   - It iterates through the grid to find the optimal path that results in the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The logic checks if moving right (to `a[0][i + 1]`) or down (to `a[1][i]`) would result in a '0' or '1' and updates `s` and `x` accordingly.
   - If a position `i` is found where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` with the remaining characters of `a[1]` starting from `i`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 1, representing the number of paths.
   - The program then checks for the number of valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by comparing substrings of `a[1]` and `s`.
   - If a match is found, `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the characters of the grid and constructing the string `s` accordingly.
- The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct, as it checks for the number of valid paths that yield the smallest string by comparing substrings.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
