Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` remains unchanged, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, or if `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` remain undefined.***
