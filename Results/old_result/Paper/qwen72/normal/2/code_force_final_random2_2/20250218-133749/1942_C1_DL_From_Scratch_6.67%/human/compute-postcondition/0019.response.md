Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, `i` is `x - 2`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `x - 1` times, where `x` is the number of distinct integers in `list0`.
- For each iteration, the variable `num` is calculated as the difference between the current element and the next element in `list0` minus 1.
- If `num` is 1, the `count` is incremented.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `x - 2` because the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until it reaches `x - 2`.
- The final value of `count` will be the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
