Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` (which means `k` and `k0` are the same).
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
- `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of l1)**
