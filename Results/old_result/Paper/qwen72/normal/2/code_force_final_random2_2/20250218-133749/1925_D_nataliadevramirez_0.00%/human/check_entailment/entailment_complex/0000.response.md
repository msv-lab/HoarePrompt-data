Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a chosen friend pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The solution involves computing the sum of the initial friendship values multiplied by the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which represents the total increase in friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Parameters**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
- **Logic**:
  - The function iterates over each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)` in `friendships`.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `MOD`.

This logic correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over \( k \) excursions. The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` correctly represents the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is the total increase in friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Logic**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
  - It calls `func_1` with the read parameters and prints the result.
  - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input and output are processed as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement. They handle the input and output as specified, and the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correct.

Correctness: **True**
