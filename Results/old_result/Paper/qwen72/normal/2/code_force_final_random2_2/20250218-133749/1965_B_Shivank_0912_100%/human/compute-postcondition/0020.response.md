The code appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 2, the value `1 << j` is `1 << 2`, which equals 4. Therefore, the value 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

If `j` is not equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`. After appending 4, the new state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 4]`.

If `j` is equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending 4, the new state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 4]`.

The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), `j` is 2, and `ans` is either `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 4]` if `j` is not equal to `i`, or `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 4]` if `j` is equal to `i`.**
