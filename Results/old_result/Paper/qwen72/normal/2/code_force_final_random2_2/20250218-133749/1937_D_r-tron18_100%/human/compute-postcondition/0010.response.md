To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is 0.
- The current value of `ol` is less than or equal to the current value of `zr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`.
2. **Argument Values**:
   - `suffZero` is a list with a single element `[0]`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
3. **Function Behavior**: The behavior of `func_1` is not specified, but we assume it returns some value based on the arguments provided.
4. **Result Assignment**: The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to `zeroInd`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `zeroInd` is assigned a new value based on the result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1`, and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is 0.
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` which is 0, `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**
