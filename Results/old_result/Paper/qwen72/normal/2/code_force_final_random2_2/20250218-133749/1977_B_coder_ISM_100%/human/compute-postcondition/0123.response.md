Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first. `s[1]` remains unchanged, `s[0]` is '-1', `flag` is 1. In all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.**
