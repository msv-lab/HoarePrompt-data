Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` is still greater than 1, indicating that there are at least two nodes.
- The variable `k` retains its value as the second integer read from the input.
- The variable `adj` is now a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `a` and `b`, respectively, as specified by the input pairs.
- The variable `z` remains 2.
- The variable `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` hold the last pair of integers read from the input.
- The variables `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` retain their values as described in the initial state, which are related to the number of cuts required to achieve a certain `leftover` value.
