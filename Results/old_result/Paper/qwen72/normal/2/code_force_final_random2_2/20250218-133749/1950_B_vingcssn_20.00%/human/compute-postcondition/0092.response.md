Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from standard input (stdin). It expects the first line to contain an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it expects an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of a checkerboard to be generated. Depending on the value of `n`, the function prints a specific pattern of `#` and `.` characters to stdout. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard. For any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. **
