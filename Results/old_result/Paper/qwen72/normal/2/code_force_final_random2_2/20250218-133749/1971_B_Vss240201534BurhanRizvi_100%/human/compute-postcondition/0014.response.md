Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and the length of `s` is greater than 1. If all characters in `s` are the same, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.***
