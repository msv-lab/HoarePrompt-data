Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to run as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list (`n`).
- In each iteration, the value of `curr_v` is assigned to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list, and then `curr_v` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, meaning it will visit every `k`-th index in the `permutation` list.
- The loop stops when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds `n`.
- After the loop completes, `permutation` will have values at indices that are multiples of `k` (i.e., `0, k, 2*k, ...`), and these values will be `1, 2, 3, ...` respectively.
- The final value of `curr_v` will be `n // k + 1` because it increments once for each multiple of `k` up to the last valid index.
- The final value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `n` because it will be the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
