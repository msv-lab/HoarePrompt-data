You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters but expects input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of the checkerboard to be generated.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')

            print('##..##..')

    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, the value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is 4, the value of `n` remains 4. For all other values of `n` (including any value not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4), the value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from standard input (stdin). It expects the first line to contain an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it expects an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the size of a checkerboard to be generated. Depending on the value of `n`, the function prints a specific pattern of `#` and `.` characters to stdout. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard. For any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly and fails to handle other valid values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For example, if `n = 5`, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to handle any value of `n` within the specified range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
