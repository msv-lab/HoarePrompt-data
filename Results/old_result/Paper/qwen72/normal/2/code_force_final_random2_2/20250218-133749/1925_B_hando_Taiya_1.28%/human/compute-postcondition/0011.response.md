Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `max(0, x // i)`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.***
