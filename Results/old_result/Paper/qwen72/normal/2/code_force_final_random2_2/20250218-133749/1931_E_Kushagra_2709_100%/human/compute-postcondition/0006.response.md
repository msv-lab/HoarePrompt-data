The value of `tot` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since the condition about the last character of `num` does not affect the execution of the given code snippet, it remains part of the state.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last character of `num` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as is.**
