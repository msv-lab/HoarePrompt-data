Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each case to calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and prints the result for each test case. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for both types of icons seems accurate, taking into account the space each type of icon occupies and the total available space on a screen. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that any fractional part of a screen is rounded up to the next whole number, which is necessary since you can't have a fraction of a screen. The conditions for handling cases where either `x` or `y` is zero are also correctly implemented. Therefore, the program is correct.
