The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is initially `[1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is initially `[26]` if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 52.

After appending 26 to `arr`, the updated values of `arr` are:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 52.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is updated as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`; if `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 52.**
