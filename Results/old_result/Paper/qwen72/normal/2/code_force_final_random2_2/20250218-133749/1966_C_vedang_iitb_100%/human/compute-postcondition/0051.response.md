The only object in the loop head is the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `sz` will be the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element, and `sz` will be set to the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element of `a`**
