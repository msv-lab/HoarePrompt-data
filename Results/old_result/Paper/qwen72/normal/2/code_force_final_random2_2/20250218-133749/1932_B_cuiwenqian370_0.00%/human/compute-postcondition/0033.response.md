Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to process input related to multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of signs, and a string `path` containing space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns the result of processing these inputs, which is not specified in the given information.**
