The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers with constraints \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \) and \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9 \). It calculates and returns a value based on the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \). After the function concludes, the returned value represents the result of this calculation, and the input parameters remain unchanged.
