Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True unless the loop encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, in which case `ans` is set to False.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to 1.
- For each iteration, if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the digits of `arr[i - 1]` are split into a list `nums` and `arr[i]` is appended to it.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop breaks.
- If `nums` is sorted, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be 1 (since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches 1).
- The value of `ans` will be True unless the loop encountered a condition that set it to False.
