Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses a series of queries to determine the maximum XOR value between any two elements in the permutation. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element (`mak`)**: The program starts by finding an element `mak` that is part of the pair with the maximum XOR value. This is done by comparing each element with itself and updating `mak` if the current element is greater.

3. **Finding Potential Pairs (`pans`)**: After identifying `mak`, the program looks for other elements that could potentially form the maximum XOR pair with `mak`. It does this by comparing `mak` with every other element and collecting those that are equal to `mak` in terms of the bitwise OR operation.

4. **Determining the Final Pair**: Among the potential pairs collected in `pans`, the program finds the element that, when XORed with `mak`, gives the maximum value. This is done by comparing each element in `pans` with `mak`.

5. **Outputting the Result**: Finally, the program outputs the indices of the pair that gives the maximum XOR value.

The program adheres to the constraints and uses at most 3n queries, making it a valid solution for the problem.
