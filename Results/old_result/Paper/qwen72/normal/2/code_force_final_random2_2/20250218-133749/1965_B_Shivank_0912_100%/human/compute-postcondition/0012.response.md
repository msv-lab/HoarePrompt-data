To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(20):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the constant `20`. The loop will execute if `range(20)` generates a sequence of numbers, which it always does because `20` is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `tc` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\)
- `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`

Since the loop will always execute due to the `range(20)`, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that the initial state is correctly represented.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, `j` is 0**
