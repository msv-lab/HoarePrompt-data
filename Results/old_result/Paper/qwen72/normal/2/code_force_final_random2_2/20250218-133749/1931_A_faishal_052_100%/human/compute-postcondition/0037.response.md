Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is less than 1 or greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26, and `arr` is [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its original value. Since the initial value of `lex` was less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be less than 1 or greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
