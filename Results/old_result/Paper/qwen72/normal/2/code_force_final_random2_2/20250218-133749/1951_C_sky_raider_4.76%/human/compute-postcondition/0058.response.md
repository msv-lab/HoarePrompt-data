Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * s` (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`), `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: After each iteration, `k` is reduced by `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`. After `n` iterations, `k` will be `k - n * s`.
- **`s`**: `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and the original `k` at each iteration and remains consistent throughout the loop.
- **`c`**: The value of `c` is updated in each iteration by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. After `n` iterations, `c` will be the sum of these updates plus the initial value of `k * k / 2`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
