Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. The list `results` will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', the corresponding element in `results` is 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's but does not meet the exact two '1's and '11' condition, the corresponding element in `results` is 'yes'. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the corresponding element in `results` is 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, `r` is the first element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, `r` is the second element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `results` is a non-empty list containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop, `r` is the third element of `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
