The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially 0 if 'B' is present in the string `s`, or `m` if 'B' is not present in the string `s`.

If 'B' is not present in `s`, `ans` was initially set to `m`. After executing `ans += m`, `ans` will be `2 * m`.

If 'B' is present in `s`, `ans` was initially 0. After executing `ans += m`, `ans` will be `m`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'B' is not present in the string `s`, then `ans` is set to `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'B' is not present in the string `s`, then `ans` is set to `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `m`.**
