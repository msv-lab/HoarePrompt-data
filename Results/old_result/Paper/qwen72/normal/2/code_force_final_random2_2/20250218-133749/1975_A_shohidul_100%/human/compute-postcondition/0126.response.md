Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then, for each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If the list is not non-decreasing, it checks if there is a valid split point in the list such that the remaining sublist is non-decreasing and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If such a split point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
