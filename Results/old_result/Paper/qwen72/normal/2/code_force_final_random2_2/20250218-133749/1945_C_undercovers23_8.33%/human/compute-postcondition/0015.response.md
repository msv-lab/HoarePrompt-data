To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the expression `range(n - 1)` depends on `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0 (the starting value of the range).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
- **`i` is 0**: This is the initial value of `i` before the loop starts.

### Final State:
The other variables (`t`, `_`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0**
