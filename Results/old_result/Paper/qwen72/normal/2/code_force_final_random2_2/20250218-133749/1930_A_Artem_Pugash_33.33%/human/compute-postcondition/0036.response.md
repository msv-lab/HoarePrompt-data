Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the second element of `numbers` (after the pop operation), `b` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `suma` is `2 * b`, and `numbers` now contains one less element (the first element has been removed).**
