Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all the application icons, given the constraints and the sizes of the icons. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1×1 and 2×2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Screens:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to the number of 2×2 icons (`b`).
   - If `t` (number of 2×2 icons) is even, it is divided by 2. If odd, it is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This step ensures that the number of screens required to fit all 2×2 icons is correctly calculated.
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2×2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows × 3 columns), and each 2×2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If `t1` (remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1×1 icons), then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated by dividing the remaining number of 1×1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`) by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

**Verification:**
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2×2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and determining if additional screens are needed for 1×1 icons is also correct.
- The program handles edge cases such as when there are no icons (`a = 0` and `b = 0`).

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
