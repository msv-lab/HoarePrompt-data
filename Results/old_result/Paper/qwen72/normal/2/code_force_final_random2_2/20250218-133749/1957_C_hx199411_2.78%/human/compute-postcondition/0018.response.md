The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `c` and `r` are now determined by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.**
