Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2`, `k` is now `k - s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is `k - s`, which means `k` is reduced by the minimum of `m` and `k`.
