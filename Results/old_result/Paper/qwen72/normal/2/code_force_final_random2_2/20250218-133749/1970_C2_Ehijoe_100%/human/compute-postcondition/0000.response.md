The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` and `t` are already integers, and `t` is specifically set to 1. The input will overwrite these values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game.**
