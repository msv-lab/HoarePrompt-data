The value of `cost` is updated by adding the value of `right - left + 1`. Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, the expression `right - left + 1` evaluates to `1 - 0 + 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `cost` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order but with the first two characters swapped, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, and the second character of `s` (i.e., `s[right]`) is '1' while the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[left]`) is '0'.**
