### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during \(k\) excursions.
   - Each pair's friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship and multiplies the initial friendship value \(f\) by the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\).
     - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.
     - The formula \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\) correctly represents the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which is the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions.
     - However, this approach assumes that each pair is chosen exactly once in each excursion, which is not the case. The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), and the list of friendships.
     - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for the current test case and prints it.
     - The handling of multiple test cases is correct.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair.
   - The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\) for each pair.
   - The expected value for each pair being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \times f\).
   - Over \(k\) excursions, the expected value for each pair is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times f\).
   - The total expected value for all pairs is the sum of these expected values for all pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect for calculating the expected value.

Final: **False**
