Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to decode the encoded value into the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

- **Input:** `n = 55`
- **Expected Output:** `czz`
- **Actual Output:** `azz`

The program incorrectly assigns the first two characters as 'a' and 'z', which results in the word "azz" instead of the correct "czz".

To further illustrate, let's break down the logic:
1. The program checks if `lex` is less than 28, and if so, it appends 1 to the array and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
2. It then checks if `lex` is less than 52, and if so, it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
3. Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array and sorts it.

For `n = 55`:
- The first loop iteration will append 1 and subtract 1, making `lex = 54`.
- The second loop iteration will append 26 and subtract 26, making `lex = 28`.
- The third value will be 28, and the array will be `[1, 26, 28]`.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 26, 28]`, which translates to "azz".

However, the correct output should be "czz", which can be achieved by assigning the values 3, 26, and 26 to the array, resulting in "czz".

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
