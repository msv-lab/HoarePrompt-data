The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `R - L > 1`. Right before the loop, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. The difference between `R` and `L` is 100000, which is greater than 1, so the loop can execute without any adjustments.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`**
