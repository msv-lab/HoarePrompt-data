To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of the range (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (1). This means `m - 1` must be at least 1, which implies `m` must be at least 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m`**: Ensure `m` is at least 2.
- **`i`**: Initialize `i` to `m - 1`.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is True

We need to adjust `m` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True**
