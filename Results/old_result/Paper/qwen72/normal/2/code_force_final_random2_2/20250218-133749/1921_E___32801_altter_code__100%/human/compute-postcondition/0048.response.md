To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: This is determined based on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`.
     - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `t = abs(y_b - y_a + 1)`.
     - If `y1` < `y2`, then `t = abs(y_b - y_a - 1)`.
   - `r`: A list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
   - `n`: Equal to `h`.
   - `m`: Equal to `w`.
   - `x1`: Equal to `x_a + 1 + a`.
   - `x2`: Initially equal to `x_b - a`, but it is stated that `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - `x2 - x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `b`: Equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `y2` <= `y1`, then:
     - `y2` is set to 1.
     - `c` is set to `y1 - 1`.
     - `a` is adjusted based on the initial values of `y1` and `y2`.
   - If `y2` > `y1`, then:
     - `y2` is set to `m`.
     - `c` is set to `m - y1`.
     - `a` is adjusted based on the initial values of `y1` and `y2`.
   - Additional conditions:
     - Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1`, or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1`, or `x1 > n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('draw')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **draw**
