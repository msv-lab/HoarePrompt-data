Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2, `len(nums)` is 21. If `nums[2]` (which is \(2^2 = 4\)) is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
