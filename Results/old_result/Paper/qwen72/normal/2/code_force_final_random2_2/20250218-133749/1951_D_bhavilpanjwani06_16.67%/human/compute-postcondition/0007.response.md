Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(n)
```

The code will print the value of `n`. According to the initial state, `n` is a positive integer and it is equal to `k`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe it as a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^18.

Output: **n (where n is a positive integer and n is equal to k, with 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18)**
