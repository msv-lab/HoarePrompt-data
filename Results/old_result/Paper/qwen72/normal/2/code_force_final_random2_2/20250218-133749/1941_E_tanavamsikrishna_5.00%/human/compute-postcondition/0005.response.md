Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is now a list containing one element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`. `i` is 0, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.**
