Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, each within the range 1 to 10^9. It calculates and returns the maximum profit value (`max_profit`) that can be achieved based on these inputs. The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value, ensuring that the returned `max_profit` is the highest profit encountered during the search process. The original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The returned `max_profit` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. **
