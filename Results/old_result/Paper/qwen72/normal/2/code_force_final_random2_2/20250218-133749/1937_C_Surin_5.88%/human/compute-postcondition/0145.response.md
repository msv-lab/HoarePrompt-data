Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
