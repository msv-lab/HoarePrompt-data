To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the program state, let's break down the details:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- The condition `2 < n` will always be true for any valid `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `permutation` is a list or array.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is an index or list of indices.
   - `curr_v` is a value that will be assigned to the specified index in `permutation`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code assigns the value of `curr_v` to the position(s) in the `permutation` list specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, and the condition `2 < n` remain unchanged.

3. **Updated State:**
   - The `permutation` list is updated at the index or indices specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i` with the value `curr_v`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` remain within their specified ranges.
   - The condition `2 < n` remains true.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v`.**
