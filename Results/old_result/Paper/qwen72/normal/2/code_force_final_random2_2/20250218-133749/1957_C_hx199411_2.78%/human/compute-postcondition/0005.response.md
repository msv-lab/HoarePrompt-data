To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(k):
```

The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively.
- `num` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 0**
