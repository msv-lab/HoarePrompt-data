Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `(1 << i) - 1`, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. This value is calculated using the exponent `i`, which represents the number of times the loop executed, and `temp`, which is the largest power of 2 less than `k`. All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previously defined values.
