Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
