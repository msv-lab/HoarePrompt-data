Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `zero_perc` remains `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `i` is incremented by 1, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` includes `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.** 

Explanation:
- `lst.append(i + 1)` adds the value `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
- The values of `one_perc`, `zero_perc`, `i`, `zero`, and `one` are updated as described in the initial state.
- The condition for appending `i + 1` to `lst` is checked based on the updated values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
