The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is now an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` was even, `t` is now equal to `b // 2`. If `t` was odd, `t` is now even and equal to `(t // 2) + 1`. Additionally, `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
