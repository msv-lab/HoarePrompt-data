The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs `t` times).

State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[2]`, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**
