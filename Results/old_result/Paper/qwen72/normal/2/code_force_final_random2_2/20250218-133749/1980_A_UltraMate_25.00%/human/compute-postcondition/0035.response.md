Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `p = 'ABCDEF'` reassigns the variable `p` to the string 'ABCDEF'. Since `p` was already set to 'ABCDEF' in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `p`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
