### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The key points are:
- Signs occur sequentially.
- The i-th sign occurs every \(a_i\) years.
- The (i+1)-th sign starts occurring strictly after the i-th sign.

However, the provided functions do not align with the problem requirements:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function appears to be designed for a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters. It uses dynamic programming to count the maximum number of '@' symbols while avoiding '*'. This is completely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when the nth sign occurs.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is not designed to solve the given problem, the results produced by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

Given that the functions provided do not address the problem of finding the year when the nth sign occurs, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
