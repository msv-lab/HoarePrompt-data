The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the standard output buffer to flush, which means any buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0**
