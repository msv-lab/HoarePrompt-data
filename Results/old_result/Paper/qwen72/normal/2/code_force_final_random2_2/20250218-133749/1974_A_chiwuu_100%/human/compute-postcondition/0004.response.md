Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is now an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the variable `b` from a string to an integer. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged. The new value of `b` is an integer, reflecting the conversion from its original string representation.
