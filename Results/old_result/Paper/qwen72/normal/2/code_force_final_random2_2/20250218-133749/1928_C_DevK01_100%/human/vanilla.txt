- The program correctly implements the logic to find all possible \( k \) values that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The use of divisors and the check for the square root ensures that all potential \( k \) values are considered.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness:
