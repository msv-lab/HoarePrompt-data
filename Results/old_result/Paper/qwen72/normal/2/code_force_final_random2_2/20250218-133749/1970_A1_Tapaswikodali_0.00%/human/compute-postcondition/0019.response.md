The code appends a tuple to the `details` list. This tuple consists of the current `balance`, `-i`, and `char`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` is 2.
- `char` is the third character of `s`.
- `balance` is adjusted based on the first three characters of `s`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`details.append((balance, -i, char))`**:
   - `balance` remains the same as it was calculated based on the first three characters of `s`.
   - `-i` is calculated as `-2` because `i` is 2.
   - `char` is the third character of `s`.

Therefore, the tuple `(balance, -2, char)` is appended to the `details` list.

The output state is:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `i` is 2.
- `char` is the third character of `s`.
- `balance` is adjusted based on the first three characters of `s`.
- `details` includes the tuple `(balance, -2, char)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `s`, `balance` is adjusted based on the first three characters of `s`, `details` includes the tuple `(balance, -2, char)`.**
