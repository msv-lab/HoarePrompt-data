Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input.
- `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.
- `x` is equal to \((xb - xa) // 2\).
- The absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and \(ya - x\).
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and \(yb + x\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (xb - xa) // 2`
   - Since the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `x` will be an integer.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)`
   - This ensures that `l` is at least 1 and at most `ya - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
   - This ensures that `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition in the print statement is `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`.
   - This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true, the print statement will output `['Bob']`.
   - If the condition is false, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the condition, the output will be either `Draw` or `Bob` depending on whether the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true or false.

Output: **Draw or Bob (depending on whether the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is true or false)**
