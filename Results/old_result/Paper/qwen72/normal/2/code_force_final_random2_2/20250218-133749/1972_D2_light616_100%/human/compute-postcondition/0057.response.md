To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are input integers.
   - `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where:
     - `gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
     - `(x + y) * x <= n`.
     - `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Finding `x`:**
     - `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
     - For example, if `n = 15`, then `x = 4` because `4 * 4 = 16 > 15`.

   - **Finding Valid Pairs `(x, y)`:**
     - We need to find pairs `(x, y)` where `y` starts from 1 and increments.
     - For each `y`, check if `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
     - Check if `(x + y) * x <= n`.
     - Check if `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - Initialize `cnt` to 0.
   - Iterate over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - For each `y`, check the conditions:
     - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `(x + y) * x <= n`, and `(x + y) * y <= m`, increment `cnt`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of valid pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions gcd(x, y) == 1, (x + y) * x <= n, and (x + y) * y <= m)**
