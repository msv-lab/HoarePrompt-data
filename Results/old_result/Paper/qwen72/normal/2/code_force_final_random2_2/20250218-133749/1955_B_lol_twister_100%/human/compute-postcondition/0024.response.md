Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` contains the elements `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, and `a + k * c + d * h`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `h` is 2, the new element appended is `a + k * c + 2 * d`. The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged, and the list `li` now includes the new element.
