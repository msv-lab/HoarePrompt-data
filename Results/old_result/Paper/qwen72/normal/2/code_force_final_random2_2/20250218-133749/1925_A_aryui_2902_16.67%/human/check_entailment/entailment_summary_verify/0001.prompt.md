You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26`. It then constructs a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times. The function returns this constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a string `s` that consists of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters will appear as subsequences in the generated string `s`.

To understand why, consider the following points:
1. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem requires that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters must appear as subsequences in the output string `s`. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program's approach of repeating the first `k` letters `n` times (e.g., "aabb" for `n = 2` and `k = 2`) does not ensure that all these strings appear as subsequences.
2. **Smallest Length**: The program does not attempt to minimize the length of the output string `s`. The requirement is to print the shortest possible string that satisfies the condition. Repeating the first `k` letters `n` times often results in a longer string than necessary.

A correct approach would involve constructing a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once. However, the given program does not use this approach.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
