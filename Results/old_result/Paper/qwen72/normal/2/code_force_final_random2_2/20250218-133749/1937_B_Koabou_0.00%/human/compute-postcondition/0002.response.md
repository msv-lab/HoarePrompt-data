The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the range object `range(2)`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if the range object has elements to iterate over. Since `range(2)` generates a sequence from 0 to 1 (inclusive), the loop will always execute twice regardless of the other variables.

However, since the task specifies that we should adjust the states for the loop to execute, and given that the loop will always execute due to the `range(2)` definition, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. The state of `t`, `n`, and the binary strings do not affect the loop's execution directly as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged but explicitly stated for clarity:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and the loop will execute 2 times because of `range(2)`**.
