Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is either `n - 1 - j` where `j` is the index at which the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met, `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[j] + k // (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or the last element of `a` if the condition was never met, and `rem` is either `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or 0 if the condition was never met.***
