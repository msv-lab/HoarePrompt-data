To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `c`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `m` is a new input integer.
- `k` is updated to `k - n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`.
- `c` is computed as \( c = \frac{k^2}{2} + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}) \).
- `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`.

2. **Update `k`:**
   - `k` is updated to `k - n * s`.

3. **Compute `c`:**
   - The formula for `c` is \( c = \frac{k^2}{2} + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}) \).

### Explanation of the Formula:
- **First Term: \( \frac{k^2}{2} \):**
  - This term depends on the updated value of `k`.

- **Second Term: \( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}) \):**
  - This term is a sum over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - For each `j` in this range, it computes \( l[j] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2} \).
  - `l[j]` is the `j`-th element of the sorted list `l`.
  - `s` is the same value used in the first term.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c` after the above calculations.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the given formula and the initial state, the output will be the integer value of `c` as described.

Output: **int(c) (where c is calculated as \( c = \frac{k^2}{2} + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (l[j] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}) \), with `k` updated to `k - n * s` and `s` being the minimum of `m` and the original `k`)**
