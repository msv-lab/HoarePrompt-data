Output State: **After all iterations, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until it either finds a '0' in `s` or reaches the end of the list `s`. After all iterations, `right` will either point to the first occurrence of '0' in `s` or be equal to the length of `s` if no '0' is found. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `cost`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
