Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then `s` is further updated to `s - 2 * (b - a + 1)`. Otherwise, `s` remains as it was after the initial update (or remains unchanged if `a` is less than 2).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is adjusted to be the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
