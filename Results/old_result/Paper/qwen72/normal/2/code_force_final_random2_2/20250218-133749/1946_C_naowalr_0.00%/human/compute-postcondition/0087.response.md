Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, and `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`. This means that the loop will stop when `R - L` is either 1 or 0.
- During each iteration, `x` is set to the midpoint between `L` and `R`. The variable `numCuts` is reset to 0, and `leftover` is computed using `dfs(1, 1)`.
- If the number of cuts required (`numCuts`) is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will eventually converge to a point where `R - L` is 1. At this point, `L` will be the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `R` will be `L + 1`, and `numCuts` will be the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.
