The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
