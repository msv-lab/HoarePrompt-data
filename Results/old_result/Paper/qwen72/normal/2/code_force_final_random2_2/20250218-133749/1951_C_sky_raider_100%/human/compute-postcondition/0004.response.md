Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by user input, `t` is 0.** 

The variable `t` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `t` with the value 0.
