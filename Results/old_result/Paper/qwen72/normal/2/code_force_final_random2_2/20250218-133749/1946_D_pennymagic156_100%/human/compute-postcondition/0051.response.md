The code snippet updates the value of `op` using the bitwise XOR operation with the result of shifting `val` right by `i` bits and then applying a bitwise AND with 1. This operation effectively toggles the `i`-th bit of `op` based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements
- `val` is the third element in `a`
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`
- If `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Update `op`:**
   - `op ^= val >> i & 1` means `op` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR with the result of `val` shifted right by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1.
   - This operation toggles the `i`-th bit of `op` based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.

2. **Check `op` and update `cnt`:**
   - After updating `op`, if `op` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Since the exact values of `op`, `val`, and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and if `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
