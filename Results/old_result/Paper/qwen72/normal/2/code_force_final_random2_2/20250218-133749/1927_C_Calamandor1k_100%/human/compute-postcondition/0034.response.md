The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This changes the content of `results` but does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, the next tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**
