Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 2 or n - 3 (depending on its initial value), `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 and `k` is not 0, otherwise `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, and `k` and `a[l]` are updated accordingly if `a[l]` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. No changes are made to the variables in this step.**
