Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `m`, or `x`. The variable `s` remains unchanged because the code snippet provided does not modify `s`. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
