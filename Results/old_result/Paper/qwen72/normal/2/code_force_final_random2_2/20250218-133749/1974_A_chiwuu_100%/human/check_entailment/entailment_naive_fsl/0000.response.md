Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is odd and the remaining space on the last screen is insufficient to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t1` and subsequently `t2` and adjusting `t` can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input `(a=1, b=7)`:
- The program calculates `t` as `b // 2 + 1`, which is `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`.
- It then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is `4 * 15 - 7 * 4 = 60 - 28 = 32`.
- Since `t1` (32) is greater than `a` (1), it sets `t` to 4.
- However, the correct number of screens needed is actually 5, because 7 2x2 icons require 4 screens (since 7 is odd, one screen will have only one 2x2 icon), and the remaining 1 1x1 icon requires an additional screen.

This indicates that the program does not correctly account for the distribution of 1x1 icons when the number of 2x2 icons is odd and the remaining space is insufficient.
