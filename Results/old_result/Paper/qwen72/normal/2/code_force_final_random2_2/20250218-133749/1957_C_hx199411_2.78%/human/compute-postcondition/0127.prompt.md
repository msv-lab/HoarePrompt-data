Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made. If `m` is 1, `i` is `k-1`. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, each calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. If `m` is 0, the program continues with the current values. If `m` is 1, the program continues with the current values. If `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program remains in the same state. If `m` is 1, the program continues with `m` as 1. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m - 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
