### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands and compute the required remainders.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements being removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.

4. **Computing Remainders:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to compute the product of the elements.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and taking the modulus `m` at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the correct remainders are computed.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` to ensure the remainders are in the correct order.

5. **Output:**
   - The main loop prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Original Issue:**
  - The original code did not take the modulus `m` at each step of the product calculation, which could lead to overflow and incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
- The corrected code ensures that the product is taken modulo `m` at each step, preventing overflow and ensuring the correct remainders are computed.

### Verification:
- **Function Summary:**
  - The function `func_1` processes the commands and computes the cumulative products modulo `m` correctly.
  - The use of `p = (p * v) % m` ensures that the product remains within the bounds of `m` and prevents overflow.
  - The final state of the function is that it returns a list of cumulative products corresponding to the elements in `b`, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The corrected code addresses the original issue and correctly implements the required functionality.
- The function `func_1` and the overall program logic are now correct and meet the problem specifications.

Final: **True**
