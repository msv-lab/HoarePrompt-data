The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `n` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
