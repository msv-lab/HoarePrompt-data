The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, and `rem` is 0.**
