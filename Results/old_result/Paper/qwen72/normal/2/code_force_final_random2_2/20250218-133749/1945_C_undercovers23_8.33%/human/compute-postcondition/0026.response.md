To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is 100,000,000
- `i` is 0
- `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains `i` and `n`.
2. **Adjustment of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, the condition `i < n - 1` will still hold true after incrementing `i` by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 1
- `n` remains greater than 1

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is `[1]` if the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.**
