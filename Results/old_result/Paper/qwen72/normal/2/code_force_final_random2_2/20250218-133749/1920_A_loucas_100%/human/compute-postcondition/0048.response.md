The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `no`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `no`. If there are more elements in `no`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of the non-empty list `no`. For the loop to execute one more time, `no` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element of `no`.

State: **`i` is the third element of the non-empty list `no` that must have at least 3 elements. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.**
