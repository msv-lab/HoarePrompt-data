Postcondition: ***`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least three elements. `x` is the third element of `odds`, and `prev` is the second element of `odds`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the third element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.***
