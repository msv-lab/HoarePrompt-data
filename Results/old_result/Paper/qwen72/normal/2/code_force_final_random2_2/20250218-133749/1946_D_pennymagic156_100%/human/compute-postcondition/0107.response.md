Output State: **`i` remains 28, `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is the result of XORing the bits at position 28 of all elements in `a`, `a` remains a list with its original elements, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If the final `op` is 0, `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` where the bit at position 28 is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
