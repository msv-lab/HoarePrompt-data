Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`.** 

Explanation: The code sets `empty` to False, changing its value from its initial state (which could be True or False). All other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `tree`) remain unchanged.
