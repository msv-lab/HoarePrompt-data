Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` was odd or even.**

### Explanation:
- **`data`**: Remains unchanged as it is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- **`index`**: After `t` iterations, the loop increments `index` by 2 for each iteration (once for `n` and once for `s`). Therefore, `index` will be `2 * t + 1` after all iterations.
- **`t`**: Remains the same as the integer value of `data[0]`, which must be a positive integer.
- **`results`**: Contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the parity of the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s`. Each iteration appends one result to the list, so after `t` iterations, `results` will contain `t` elements.
