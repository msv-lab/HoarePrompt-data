Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is equal to `cases - 1`, `info` is a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2, and `range` is 3.**

### Explanation:
- **`cases`**: This variable remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 1 and 100.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `cases - 1`.
- **`info`**: This list now contains `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with the specified conditions.
- **`temp`**: After the final iteration, `temp` will be a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`.
- **`j`**: The inner loop runs 3 times for each iteration of the outer loop, so `j` will be 2 after the last iteration of the inner loop.
- **`range`**: The `range` function is used to iterate over the indices, and it remains 3 as specified in the code.
