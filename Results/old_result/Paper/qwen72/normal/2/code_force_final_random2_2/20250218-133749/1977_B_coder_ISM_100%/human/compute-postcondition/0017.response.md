The code snippet `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. Given the initial state, the list `s` initially contains two elements, and depending on the bit at position 0 in `x`, `s` could be one of the following combinations: `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']`. After appending `'0'`, the list `s` will have three elements, and the new element will be `'0'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing three elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is set (i.e., 1), then `s` is either `['1', '1', '0']` or `['0', '1', '0']`. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), then `s` is either `['1', '0', '0']` or `['0', '0', '0']`.**
