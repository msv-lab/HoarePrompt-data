Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `rem` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is equal to `a[3]`, and `y` is `n - 2`.***
