### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`), which is `n`.
   - It then reads the list of `2n` integers and splits them into a list called `numbers`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `numbers` is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.
   - This ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The function initializes a variable `suma` to store the total score.
   - It enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list `numbers`.
   - It adds the minimum of these two elements to `suma`.
   - This process continues until the list `numbers` is empty.
   - Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the first two elements will always be the smallest two elements, and thus the minimum of these two will be the smallest element, which is the optimal choice for maximizing the score.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the function prints the total score `suma`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Sorting**:
  - Sorting the list in ascending order ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first. This is crucial because the goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values of each pair.
  - By always taking the smallest two elements, we ensure that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible, which maximizes the score.

- **Loop and Popping Elements**:
  - The loop correctly processes the list in pairs, ensuring that exactly `n` pairs are processed.
  - The use of `pop(0)` to remove the first two elements is correct but inefficient for large lists due to the O(n) complexity of popping from the beginning of a list. However, for the given constraints (up to 100 elements per test case), this inefficiency is manageable.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list to ensure optimal pairing and correctly calculates the maximum score for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
