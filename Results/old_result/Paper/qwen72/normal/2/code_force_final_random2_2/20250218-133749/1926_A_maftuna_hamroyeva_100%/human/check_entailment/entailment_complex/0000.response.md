Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, iterates through each test case, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string, and prints the character that appears more frequently. The conditions and logic used in the program align with the problem requirements. The program handles all edge cases, such as when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, by printing 'B' (which is correct since 'B' is not less frequent than 'A' in this case).

Correctness: **True**
