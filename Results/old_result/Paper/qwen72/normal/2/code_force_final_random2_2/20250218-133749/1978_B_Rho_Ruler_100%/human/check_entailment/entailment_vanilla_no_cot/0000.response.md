Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements a binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula \( k \cdot b - k \cdot (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) \cdot a \) to compute the profit.
   - The term \( k \cdot b - k \cdot (k - 1) / 2 \) calculates the profit from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price.
   - The term \( (n - k) \cdot a \) calculates the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) respectively.
   - It iterates using a binary search approach, calculating the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher range.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower range.
   - It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

The solution correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the maximum profit is calculated efficiently. Therefore, the solution is correct.
