Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration or the next line of code outside the loop. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
