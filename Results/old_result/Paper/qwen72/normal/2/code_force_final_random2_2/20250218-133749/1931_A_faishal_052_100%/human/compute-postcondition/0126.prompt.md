Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr` (which was previously sorted based on the value of `lex`), `j` is 2, `arr` is now an empty list `[]`, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 0, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[1]`, `arr` is `[1]`, and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[]`, and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is updated to `[1, 1]` and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is updated to `[26, 1]` and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `arr` is updated to `[1]` and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is updated to `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is updated to `[26]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2. If `lex` is not defined, an error occurs and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `lex` is defined and less than 28, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `lex` is defined and less than 52, `arr` now contains the integer 26 at the end, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is defined and between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is defined and greater than 78, the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
