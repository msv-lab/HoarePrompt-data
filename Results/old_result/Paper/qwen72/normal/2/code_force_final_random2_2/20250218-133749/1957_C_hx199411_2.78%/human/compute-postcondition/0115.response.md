Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `dp[1] = 1` updates the second element (index 1) of the list `dp` to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The list `dp` is still of length `m + 1`, but now the element at index 1 is set to 1.
