You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed. `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string. The set `alphabet` will be reset to its original state (containing the first k lowercase English alphabets) if the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it; otherwise, `alphabet` will contain the remaining characters that were not removed during the loop's execution.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the value of `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring is a part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. The value of `s2` is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. It only checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is not sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, it constructs a missing subsequence by appending the same character repeatedly. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is indeed a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Handling of Alphabet Set**: The program uses a set `alphabet` to track the characters in the string `s`, but it incorrectly removes characters from the set and does not properly handle the construction of `s2`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. The current implementation does not do this.

- **Construction of Missing Subsequence**: The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending the same character repeatedly, which is not a valid approach. For example, if `n = 3`, `k = 3`, and `s = "aabbcc"`, the program might incorrectly output `"ccc"` as a missing subsequence, even though `"ccc"` is a valid subsequence of `s`.

To fix these issues, the program would need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If a missing subsequence is found, return it.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
