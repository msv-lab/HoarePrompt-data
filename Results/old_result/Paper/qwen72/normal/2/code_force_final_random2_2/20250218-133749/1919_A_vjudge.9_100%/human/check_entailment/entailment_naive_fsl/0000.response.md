Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This approach fails to consider the optimal strategy that both players would employ during the game. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 1
```

According to the provided program:
- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = 1\)
- \(|a - b| = |3 - 1| = 2\), which is even.
- Therefore, the program outputs "Bob".

However, let's analyze the game step-by-step:
1. Alice starts with 3 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 3 coins.
3. Bob now has 3 coins and must remove 1 coin, leaving him with 2 coins.
4. Alice has 1 coin and must remove 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins.
5. Bob now has 2 coins and must remove 1 coin, leaving him with 1 coin.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.

Thus, Alice wins the game, but the program incorrectly outputs "Bob".

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and therefore is incorrect.
