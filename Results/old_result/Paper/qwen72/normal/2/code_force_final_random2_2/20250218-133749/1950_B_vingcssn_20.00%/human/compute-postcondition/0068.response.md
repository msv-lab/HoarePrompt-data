The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..'`.

- The initial state provides information about variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'##..'` directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..**
