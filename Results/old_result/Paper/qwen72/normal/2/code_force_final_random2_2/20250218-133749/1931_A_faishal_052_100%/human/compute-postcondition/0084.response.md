Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 2`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times because `range(2)` specifies that `j` will iterate from 0 to 1.
- For each iteration, the value of `lex` is checked against the conditions:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` gets two 1s appended, and `lex` is decremented by 2.
  - If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` gets two 26s appended, and `lex` is decremented by 52.
  - If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` gets two 26s appended, and `lex` is decremented by 52.
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` gets two 26s appended, and `lex` is decremented by 52.
- After both iterations, `j` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution.
