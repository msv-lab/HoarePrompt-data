Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by repeatedly reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function terminates when either the entire list has been processed or `k` is exhausted. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some of its elements reduced to 0 or altered, and the function returns the total count of elements that have been fully processed (reduced to 0 or removed). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, except for `k` which may be reduced as a result of the operations performed. **
