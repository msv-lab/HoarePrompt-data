You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It then calculates a value `t` based on these inputs, which is the minimum number of 15 × 15 grid cells required to fit all the applications, considering the space occupied by both 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons. The function prints the calculated value `t` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `a`, `b`, and `t` in their final states for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is odd and the remaining space on the last screen is insufficient to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t1` and subsequently `t2` and adjusting `t` can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input `(a=1, b=7)`:
- The program calculates `t` as `b // 2 + 1`, which is `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`.
- It then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is `4 * 15 - 7 * 4 = 60 - 28 = 32`.
- Since `t1` (32) is greater than `a` (1), it sets `t` to 4.
- However, the correct number of screens needed is actually 5, because 7 2x2 icons require 4 screens (since 7 is odd, one screen will have only one 2x2 icon), and the remaining 1 1x1 icon requires an additional screen.

This indicates that the program does not correctly account for the distribution of 1x1 icons when the number of 2x2 icons is odd and the remaining space is insufficient.
