Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The list `dp` remains the same length and retains its initial values except for the updated `dp[i]`.
