### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of these icons.
     - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the space taken by the 2x2 icons. However, the adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The term `bxsfory * 15` assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells, which is not true. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the correct adjustment should be `x = x - y * 4`.
     - After adjusting `x`, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

   - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program correctly prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The calculation for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`) is correct.
   - The calculation for the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`) is correct.
   - However, the adjustment for the number of 1x1 icons when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is incorrect. The term `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be `x = x - y * 4`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0, which is a valid scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but contains a logical error in the adjustment of the number of 1x1 icons when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. This error will lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
