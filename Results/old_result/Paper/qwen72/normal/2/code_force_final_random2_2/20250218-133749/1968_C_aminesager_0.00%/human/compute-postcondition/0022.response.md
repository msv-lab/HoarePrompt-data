Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list containing elements calculated based on the values in `T`.
- The code snippet `a = [1000]` reassigns `a` to a new list containing only the element 1000.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
