The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'..##..'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state (`c`, `casos`, and `n`). Therefore, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **..##..**
