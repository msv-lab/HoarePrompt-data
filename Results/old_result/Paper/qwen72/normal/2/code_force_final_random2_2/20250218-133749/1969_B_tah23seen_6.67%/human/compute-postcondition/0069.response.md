Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string such that all '0's are moved to the front and all '1's are moved to the back. The original string `sChar` remains unchanged, and the function internally works with a list `s` that contains the characters of `sChar`. After the function concludes, the list `s` will have all '0's at the beginning and all '1's at the end, and the return value is the total number of swaps performed to achieve this arrangement. **
