The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `x` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2.**
