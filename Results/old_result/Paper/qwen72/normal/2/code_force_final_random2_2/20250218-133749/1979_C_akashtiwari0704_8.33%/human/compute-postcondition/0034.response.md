To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`.
   - `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
   - `T` is 0.
   - `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for \(0 \leq i < \text{bets}\) is equal to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

2. **Transformations:**
   - The list `a` is transformed such that each element `a[i]` is replaced by `prod // a[i]`.
   - `ans` is constructed as a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - After the transformation, `a` contains the new values.
   - `ans` is constructed by converting these new values to strings and joining them with spaces.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will print the space-separated string representations of the elements of the transformed list `a` from `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`.

Output: **space-separated string representations of the elements of the transformed list `a` from `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`**.
