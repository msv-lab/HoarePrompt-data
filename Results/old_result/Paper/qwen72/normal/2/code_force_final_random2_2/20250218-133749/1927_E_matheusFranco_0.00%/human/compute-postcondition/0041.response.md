To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
- The current state is:
  - `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
  - `2 < n` is true.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`.
  - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must still be true after the adjustments. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must still be less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should be such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`.

Since the exact value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is not provided, we can only express the condition that must hold for the loop to continue:

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`**.
