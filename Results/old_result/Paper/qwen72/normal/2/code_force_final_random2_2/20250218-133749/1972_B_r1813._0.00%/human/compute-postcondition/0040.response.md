The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two elements ('YES' or 'NO'), and `result` is the current element being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element beyond the current one being processed.

Since the exact number of elements in `results` is not specified, we can only say that `results` must have at least three elements for the loop to execute again, assuming the last processed element was the second one.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing at least three elements (either 'YES' or 'NO')**
