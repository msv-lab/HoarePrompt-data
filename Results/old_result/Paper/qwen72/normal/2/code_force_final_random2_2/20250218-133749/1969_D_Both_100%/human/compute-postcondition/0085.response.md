Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or contains the last element of the original `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus). If `combined` was not empty, it is now missing its last element. `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.***
