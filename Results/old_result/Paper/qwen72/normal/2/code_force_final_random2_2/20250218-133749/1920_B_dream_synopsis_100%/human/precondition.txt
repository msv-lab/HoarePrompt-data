t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
