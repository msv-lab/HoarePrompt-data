Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, and `func_2()` must be less than `n`. Additionally, `cnt` is currently 0, and `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `func_2()` is called, but since there is no information about what `func_2()` does, we cannot determine if it changes any variables.
- The initial state specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, but also states that `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`. This creates a contradiction, but without further details about `func_2()`, we cannot resolve this contradiction.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
