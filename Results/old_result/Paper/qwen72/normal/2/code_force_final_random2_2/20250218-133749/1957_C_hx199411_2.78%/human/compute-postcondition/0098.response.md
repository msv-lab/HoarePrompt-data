The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is set to 2. After the increment, `num` will be 2 if `c` equals `r`, or 3 if `c` does not equal `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 3.**
