Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` (which is also `b[0]`), and `ans1` now includes an additional element which is `b[1]`. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `l` now contains the value of `b[1]`.***
