Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description requires a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates files for HTML files within a specified range of folder names. However, the provided program defines a completely different function `func_1` that reads input from the user and performs a different set of operations, which are unrelated to generating files for HTML files. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
