Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0, and the `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

Explanation:
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is flushed to the terminal or output stream. This does not affect any of the variables.
- All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `prev` being updated to 1 if `r` is '>' or remaining '<' if `r` is '<' is still valid.
