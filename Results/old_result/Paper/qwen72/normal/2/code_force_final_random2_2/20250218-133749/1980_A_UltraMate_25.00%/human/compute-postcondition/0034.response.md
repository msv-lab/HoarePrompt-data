Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` is now explicitly set to 0.
