To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Final List Construction**:
   - `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order.
   - If `len(final) == 0`:
     - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains `[0]`.
     - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains the single element `n`.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `c1` is now equal to `o * 100 // n`.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the value of `final[0]`:

- **Case 1**: If `final` is not empty after the loop, `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list of elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.
- **Case 2**: If `final` is empty:
  - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will be `[0]`, so `final[0]` will be `0`.
  - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` will be `[n]`, so `final[0]` will be `n`.

Since the exact values of `lst`, `pk`, `mini`, `o`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

### Final Output:
- If `final` is not empty, `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list of elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.
- If `final` is empty and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final[0]` will be `0`.
- If `final` is empty and `c1` is less than 50, `final[0]` will be `n`.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first element of the sorted list of elements from lst whose absolute difference with pk is equal to mini, or 0 if c1 is greater than or equal to 50, or n if c1 is less than 50)**
