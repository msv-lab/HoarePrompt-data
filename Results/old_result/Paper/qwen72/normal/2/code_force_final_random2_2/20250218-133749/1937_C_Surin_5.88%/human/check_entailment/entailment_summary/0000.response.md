Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. Here's a breakdown of the logic and verification of its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\), which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - It compares \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\) with \(p_{v2} \mid p_{v2}\) (where \(v2\) is the current index in the loop).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `v2`. This step effectively finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Index**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - It compares \(p_{v1} \mid p_{i}\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\) (where \(i\) is the current index in the loop).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This step helps in finding the second index that maximizes the XOR with the maximum element found earlier.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - After the loops, the program prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the answer for the current test case.
   - It ensures that the output is flushed to the standard output.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program uses at most \(2n\) queries in total (one for each element in the first loop and one for each element in the second loop), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\).

Given the above steps, the program correctly identifies the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
