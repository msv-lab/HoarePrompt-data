You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters, either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

    t = int(input())

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string provided by the user. If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0. If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The function only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it is part of a triangle. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, but they must be arranged in a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.). The current logic will incorrectly identify any row with exactly one '1' as a triangle, even if it is part of a square.
- **Incorrect Square Detection**: The function assumes that if any row has more than one '1', it must be part of a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and the function does not check the pattern of these '1's.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly detect the shapes based on the problem description. It fails to account for the specific patterns required for triangles and squares.

### Correctness:
**False**
