Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 50000, inclusive; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(100000, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 200000. friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 1000000000.**
