Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings. If the loop finds a position `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from the `i`-th character, and `x` is set to `i`. If no such position is found, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `y` is the largest index `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', or 0 if no such index exists.**
