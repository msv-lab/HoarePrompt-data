### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna reverses the digits of a single number in the list. This operation does not change the total number of digits across all numbers.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha concatenates two numbers, reducing the total number of numbers by one but increasing the total number of digits in the remaining list.
   - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number has at least \(10^m\) digits; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list initially is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.
   - Each time Anna makes a move, the total number of digits remains the same.
   - Each time Sasha makes a move, the total number of digits increases by the number of digits in the concatenated number minus the number of digits in the two original numbers.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`zerocnts(num)`**: This function counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of a number. This is used to adjust the total digit count when considering the effect of Anna's moves.
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This function calculates the initial total number of digits (`tot`). It then adjusts this total by subtracting the count of trailing zeros for every second number in the sorted list of trailing zero counts. This adjustment simulates the effect of Anna's moves on the total digit count. Finally, it checks if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the initial total number of digits.
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts trailing zeros.
   - The adjustment in `func_1` by subtracting every second trailing zero count simulates the effect of Anna's moves, ensuring that the total digit count is reduced appropriately.
   - The final comparison `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
