Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 3 (or greater than 4 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1'). If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is 3 (or 4 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1'), `count` is 2 (or 3 if the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `j` remains 2 (or 3 if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1'), `count` remains 2 (or 3 if the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` remains True (if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False).***
