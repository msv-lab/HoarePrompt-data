Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters with at least one element.
- `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is set to 0.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` contains at least one character. Since `i` is 0, the code will print the first element of the list `a`.

### Output Calculation:
- The `print` statement will print the first element of the list `a`.
- The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline is added after the printed character.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**

This means the output will be the first character in the list `a`.
