To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is: `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`
   - This line computes `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` with different arguments.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `zeroInd` is assigned a new value based on the result of the function calls.
   - No other variables are directly modified by this code snippet.

4. **Function `func_1` Assumption:**
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we assume it returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index provided.
   - For the purpose of this analysis, let's denote the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` as `A` and the result of `func_1(suffZero, 1)` as `B`.
   - Therefore, `zeroInd = 2 * A - B`.

5. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `zeroInd` is now `2 * A - B`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
