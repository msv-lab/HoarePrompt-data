Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0]], `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list containing the single element 1000.
- The code appends a new element to `a` which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `a[0] - T[0]`, which is `1000 - T[0]`.
- The updated list `a` now contains the elements [1000, 999 - T[0]].
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
