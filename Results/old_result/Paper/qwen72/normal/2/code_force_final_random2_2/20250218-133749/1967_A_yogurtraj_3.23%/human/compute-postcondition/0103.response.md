Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is now `a[1]`, `rem` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.** 

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `a[1]`, which is the second element in the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
