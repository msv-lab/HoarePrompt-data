You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 32`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` lines have been printed, each containing either 'A' or 'B' based on the comparison of 'A' and 'B' counts in the corresponding input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This matches the problem statement where `t` is the number of test cases and \(1 \leq t \leq 32\).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Reading Each String**: Inside the loop, the program reads a string `a` of length 5. This string is expected to consist only of the characters 'A' and 'B', which aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Counting Characters**: The program initializes two counters, `l` for 'A' and `h` for 'B'. It then iterates over each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`; otherwise, it increments `h`. This correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string.

5. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting, the program checks which counter is greater. If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic correctly determines the most frequent character in the string.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the result for each test case, which is the most frequent character ('A' or 'B').

Given that all steps match the problem requirements and the logic is sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
