Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first, except `s[2]` which is now `'-1'`. `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1', `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged. In all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'. If `flag` is true and `s[2]` is '0', `s[0]` remains unchanged.**
