Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. The final state of `s` will depend on the initial values of `s` and the transitions made during the loop. Specifically, any consecutive `'1'` pairs will be transformed into `'-1'` followed by `'0'` (or vice versa) until no more such pairs exist, and any `'0'` encountered when `flag` is 1 will be left unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, the 30th element of `s` is now `'1'`. If `flag` is 0, or if `flag` is 1 but `s[29]` is not `'0'`, the `flag` remains 0 and the list `s` contains 30 strings as described.***
