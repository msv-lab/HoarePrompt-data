The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Based on the initial state, `s` is initially set to `['1']` if the bitwise AND of `x` and `2` is non-zero, otherwise `s` is `['0']`. After appending `'1'`, the value of `s` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is `['1', '1']` if the bitwise AND of `x` and `2` is non-zero, otherwise `s` is `['0', '1']`.**
