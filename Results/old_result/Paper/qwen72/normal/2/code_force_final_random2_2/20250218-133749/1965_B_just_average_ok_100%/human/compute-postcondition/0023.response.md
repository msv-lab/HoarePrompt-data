To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the modifications made to the list `nums`.

### Initial State:
- `nums` is the original list.
- New elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are appended to `nums`.
- The value `2^idx` is removed from `nums`.
- `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Original List**: Let's assume the original list `nums` is `[a, b, c, d, ...]`.
2. **Appending New Elements**:
   - `k - nums[idx]` is appended.
   - `k + 1` is appended.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended.
3. **Removing an Element**:
   - The value `2^idx` is removed from `nums`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `k = 5`
- `idx = 1` (for simplicity, assuming `idx` is 1)

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Original List**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
2. **New Elements**:
   - `k - nums[idx] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `k + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8`
3. **Appended List**: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 6, 8]`
4. **Removing `2^idx`**:
   - `2^idx = 2^1 = 2`
   - Remove `2` from the list: `nums = [1, 3, 4, 3, 6, 8]`

### Final Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the modified list `nums` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 3 4 3 6 8**

### General Case:
If the initial state and the values of `k` and `idx` are different, the output will vary accordingly. However, the process remains the same:
1. Append `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
2. Remove `2^idx` from `nums`.
3. Print the modified list.

Output: **[elements of the modified nums list separated by spaces]**
