Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `a`. If `a > 1`, then `suma` is set to `a` and `x` remains `a`. If `a` is 1, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains `a`.**
