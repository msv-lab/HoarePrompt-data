The function reads from standard input, processing every other line starting from the third line. Each processed line represents a list of integers (cards). The function counts the occurrences of each unique integer in the list, divides the count by 3 (using integer division), and sums these values. The result is printed for each line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the computed results. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a line of input containing a list of integers. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results have been printed for each test case.
