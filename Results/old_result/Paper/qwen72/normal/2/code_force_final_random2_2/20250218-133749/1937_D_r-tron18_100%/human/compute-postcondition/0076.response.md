The code snippet assigns the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` to the variable `zeroInd`. To determine the new value of `zeroInd`, we need to consider the current state of `suffZero`.

- `suffZero` is a list that has been updated to include a new element, which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- The last element of `suffZero` before the update is `suffZero[-1]`.
- The second-to-last element of `suffZero` before the update is `suffZero[-2]`.

Given this, the new element added to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2)`.

After the update, the new last element of `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2)`, and the second-to-last element remains `suffZero[-2]`.

Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as:
- `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`

Since `suffZero[-1]` is now `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2)`, the calculation for `zeroInd` is:
- `zeroInd = (suffZero[-1] + (n - 2)) + suffZero[-2]`
- `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] + (n - 2)`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated to include a new element which is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] + (n - 2)`**.
