The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i` or the contents of `pans`, we can only say that `i` has been added to `pans`. The other conditions (`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string, and `s` is not equal to `<`, and the current value of `s` is `=`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string and its current value is `=`, `s` is not equal to `<`, `pans` now includes the value of `i`.**
