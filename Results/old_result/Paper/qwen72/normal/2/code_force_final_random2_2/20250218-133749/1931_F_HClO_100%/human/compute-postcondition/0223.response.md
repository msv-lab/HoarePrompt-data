The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. This operation modifies the list `l1` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `idx2` is `n - 3`
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is not less than `idx2`
- `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`
- `a3` is the first integer from the input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`

After executing the code:
- `l1` now contains the value `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` now contains `a1` inserted at position `n - 3`.**
