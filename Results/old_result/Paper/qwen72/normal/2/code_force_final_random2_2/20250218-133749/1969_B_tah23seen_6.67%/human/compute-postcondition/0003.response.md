The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `sChar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. The loop iterates over each character in `sChar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first character of `sChar`, and `s` contains this first character.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sChar` must have at least one more character after the first one. Therefore, `sChar` must have a length of at least 2, and `i` will now be the second character of `sChar`.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the second character of `sChar`**
