### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.

3. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the function to check the most significant elements first, which is crucial for ensuring the array can be sorted.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If so, it means the array is not sorted at this point.

5. **Digit Splitting**:
   - If the condition is met, it splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the element `arr[i - 1]` is split into digits and the resulting list of digits is sorted. It should update `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list and continue checking the rest of the array.

6. **Update Array**:
   - The function updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list, but it does not re-evaluate the array after this update. This is a critical flaw because the updated array might still need further checks to ensure it can be sorted.

7. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements into their digits.
  - However, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the array needs to be re-evaluated after updating an element with its digits.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or contain only single-digit numbers.
  - It also handles cases where the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in any element. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically flawed because it does not re-evaluate the array after updating an element with its digits. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
