To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
   - `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice with different arguments.
   - The first call is `func_1(preOne, zr)`.
   - The second call is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
   - The results of these two calls are added together and assigned to `oneInd`.

4. **Variable Updates:**
   - `oneInd` is updated to the sum of the results of the two function calls.

5. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `oneInd` is now the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.**
