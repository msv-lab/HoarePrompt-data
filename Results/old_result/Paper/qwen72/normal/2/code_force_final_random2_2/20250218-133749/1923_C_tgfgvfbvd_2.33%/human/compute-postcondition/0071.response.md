The code assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means `s` now holds the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`.**
