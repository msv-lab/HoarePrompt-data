The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` (the second element in `arr`) and its value is 2, and `n` is the second element in `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` will be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 3 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` (the second element in `arr`) and its value is 2, `n` is the third element in `arr`.**
