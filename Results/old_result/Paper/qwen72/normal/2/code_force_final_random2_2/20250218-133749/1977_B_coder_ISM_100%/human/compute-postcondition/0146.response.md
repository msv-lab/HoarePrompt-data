Output State: **After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 31, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 31 elements. Each element in `s` will be either '1', '0', or '-1', depending on the transformations applied during the loop, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'. The `flag` is 1, indicating that a transformation is pending.**
