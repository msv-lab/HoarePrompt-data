To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. These variables are unpacked from each tuple in the list `cases`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple.
   - The first tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)`.
   - `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'.
   - `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
   - `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` is a set containing elements that are common to both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - `total_distinct` (the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`, `results` contains the string 'NO'.
   - If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, `results` also contains the string 'NO'.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if there are more tuples in the `cases` list.
   - The next tuple in `cases` will be unpacked into `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

### Adjusted State:
- The next tuple in `cases` will be unpacked into `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
- The `results` list will remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, the next tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'**.
