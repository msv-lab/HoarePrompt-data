To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `v2` is 1
- `r` is the user input
- `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the upper bound `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` should be 2.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.

### Updated State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `v2` is 1
- `r` is the user input
- `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is the user input, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**
