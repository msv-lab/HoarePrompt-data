Postcondition: ***`mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, and if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.***
