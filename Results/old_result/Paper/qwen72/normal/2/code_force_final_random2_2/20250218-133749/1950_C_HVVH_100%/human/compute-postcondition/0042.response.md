Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
   - `n` is now `n` (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string `s` respectively.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The string `s` is parsed to extract `h` and `m`.
   - Depending on the value of `h`, the following updates are made:
     - If `h` is 0, `h` becomes 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
     - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` remains 'AM'.
   - The print statement formats `h` and `m` to ensure they are always two digits (e.g., 05 for 5) and prints them along with the value of `day`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the formatted time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are the hour and minute from the input string s, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**

For example, if `s` is "14:30":
- `h` is 14, so `h` becomes 14 - 12 = 2 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- The output will be: **02:30 PM**

If `s` is "00:15":
- `h` is 0, so `h` becomes 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- The output will be: **12:15 AM**

If `s` is "12:45":
- `h` is 12, so `day` is set to 'PM'.
- The output will be: **12:45 PM**

If `s` is "07:20":
- `h` is 7, so `day` remains 'AM'.
- The output will be: **07:20 AM**

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are the hour and minute from the input string s, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**
