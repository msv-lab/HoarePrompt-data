Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop.
- `i` is 1.
- `curr` is 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the values step by step:

1. **Value of `n`**: `n` is 0.
2. **Value of `k`**: `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
3. **Value of `costs`**: 
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.
4. **Value of `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs`.
   - `n` is 0, so dividing 0 by any non-zero number results in 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 divided by `-k + 1` and 0 divided by 1, which is `0 + 0 = 0`.
5. **Condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`**:
   - According to the initial state, `h` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, from the calculation, `h` is 0, which contradicts the condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given this contradiction, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the initial state provided. However, if we assume the initial state is correct and `h` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`, then the `print` statement will execute as follows:

```python
print('YES')
```

Output: **YES**

This output is based on the assumption that the initial state is correct and `h` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`, despite the apparent contradiction in the calculation.
