Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, so `_` (the loop counter) will be `m - 2` when the loop finishes.
- The variable `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each representing the first integer and the list of remaining integers from each new input during the loop's execution.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not modified within the loop.
