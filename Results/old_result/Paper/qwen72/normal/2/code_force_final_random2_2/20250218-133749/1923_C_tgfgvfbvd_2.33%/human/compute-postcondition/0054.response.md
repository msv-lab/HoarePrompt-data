The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element in `l`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l` and the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, `c` is the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the third element in `l`.**
