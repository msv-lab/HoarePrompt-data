To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `ii` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `y` is either `n - 1 - j` where `j` is the index at which the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met.
   - `k` is not 0.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `rem` is either `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or 0 if the condition was never met.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
     - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
     - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` can be broken down as follows:
     - `r - 1` is the value of `r` minus 1.
     - `(r - 1) * n` multiplies this result by `n`.
     - Adding 1 to the result gives the final value to be printed.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the last element of the list `a` as `a_last`.
   - Therefore, `r = a_last + k // n`.
   - The expression becomes: `(a_last + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

5. **Simplification:**
   - Simplifying the expression:
     - `(a_last + k // n - 1) * n + 1`
     - `= (a_last * n + (k // n) * n - n) + 1`
     - `= a_last * n + k - n + 1`
     - `= a_last * n + k - (n - 1)`

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The final value printed is `a_last * n + k - (n - 1)`.

Output: **a_last * n + k - (n - 1) (where a_last is the last element of the sorted list a, n is the number of elements in the list a, and k is a non-zero integer)**
