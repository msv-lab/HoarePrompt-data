Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1 and `cx` contains `{x}`. `n` is now `n - 1`.**
