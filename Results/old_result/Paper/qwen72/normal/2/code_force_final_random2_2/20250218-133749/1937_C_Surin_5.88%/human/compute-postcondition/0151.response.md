Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. This does not affect the values of any variables, so all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
