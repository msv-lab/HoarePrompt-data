The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt[x]` was initially 1, it is now 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the rest of the `cnt` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `cnt[x]` which is now 2, `x` is the second element in `a`.**
