### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x` set to 0.
   - It iterates through the grid from left to right, checking if moving down at any point would result in a lexicographically smaller string.
   - If it finds such a point, it updates `s` to the concatenated string and sets `x` to the current index.
   - If no such point is found, `s` will default to the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It iterates through the first `x` characters to check if the prefix of `a[0]` matches the prefix of `s`.
   - If a match is found, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no match is found, `t` remains 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string is correct. It checks for the optimal point to move down and constructs the string accordingly.
- The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. It correctly identifies the number of valid paths that lead to the smallest string by checking the prefix matches.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
