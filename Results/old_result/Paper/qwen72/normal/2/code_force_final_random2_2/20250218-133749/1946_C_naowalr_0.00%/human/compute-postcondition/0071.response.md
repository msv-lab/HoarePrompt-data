Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 50001, `numCuts` is now 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Additionally, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and either `numCuts` is less than `k` or `leftover` is less than `x`.**
