Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end.**

Explanation:
- The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
- The list `c` now contains the same elements as before, but they are sorted in ascending order.
