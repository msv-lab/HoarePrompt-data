Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It then calculates a value `t` based on these inputs, which is the minimum number of 15 × 15 grid cells required to fit all the applications, considering the space occupied by both 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons. The function prints the calculated value `t` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `a`, `b`, and `t` in their final states for the last test case. **
