Output State: **If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be 0 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1, and the loop condition is `i > 0`). The value of `v` will be the last return value of `func_2()` unless `v` was set to `n` during one of the iterations, in which case `v` will be the value of `i` at that iteration. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 because the loop stops when `i` reaches 0.
- The value of `v` will be the last value returned by `func_2()` unless `v` was set to `n` during one of the iterations, in which case `v` will be the value of `i` at that iteration.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were before the loop started, since they are not modified within the loop.
