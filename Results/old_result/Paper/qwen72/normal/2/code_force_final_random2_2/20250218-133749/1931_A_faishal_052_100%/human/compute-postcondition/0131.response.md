To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the initial value when iterating over the range of `cases`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that after all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` will be an integer between 1 and 100, and `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`. However, for the loop to start executing, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described.**
