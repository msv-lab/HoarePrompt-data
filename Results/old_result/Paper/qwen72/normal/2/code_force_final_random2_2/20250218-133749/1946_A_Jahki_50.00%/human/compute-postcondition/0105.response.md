Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is 0, `i` is `num` (which is 0), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, `op` is the total number of operations performed across all iterations. If any `num2` was greater than 10000 during the iterations, the loop broke out early. Otherwise, for each valid `num2`, `a` was a list of integers extracted from the corresponding `case`, `b` was a sorted version of `a`, `ma` was set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` was even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` was odd, `median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` before the loop started, `new_median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` after the loop completed, and `b[ma]` was incremented until `new_median` became greater than `median`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `num` is 0.
- The loop variable `i` is equal to `num`, which is 0.
- `num2` holds the last input integer provided.
- `case` holds the last input string provided.
- `op` is the total number of operations performed to increment the median value across all valid test cases.
- If any `num2` was greater than 10000, the loop broke out early, and the corresponding output was printed.
- For each valid `num2`, the list `a` was populated with integers from the input string `case`, `b` was sorted, and the median was adjusted by incrementing the middle element until it was greater than the original median. The number of increments for each test case was added to `op`.
