The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`, and `results` is a list containing at least one 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must have at least one more element (since the loop iterates over each element in `results`). The variable `i` is not used in the loop head as an iterator, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, since the loop has already iterated through `t - 1` elements, the next element would be the `t`-th element.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least `t` elements, and the next element to be processed will be the `t`-th element.

State: **`t` is equal to the number of test cases provided initially, `i` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing at least `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
