Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing `t` tuples, `case` is the last tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case, `n` is the first value from the last `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from the last `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from the last `case['params']`, `a` is the array from the last `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the modulus results of each element in the last `a` with `x` and `y`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appears in the last `a`. `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in the last `a`, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`. The variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in the last `a`.**
