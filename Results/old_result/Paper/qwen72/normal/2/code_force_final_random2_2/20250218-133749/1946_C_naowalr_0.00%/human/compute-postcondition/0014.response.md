Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes an additional element `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The list `adj[a]` now includes an additional element `b`, making it one element longer.
- The list `adj[b]` already includes `a` as per the initial state.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, `i`, and the fact that `a` and `b` are updated to new integers read from standard input remain the same.
