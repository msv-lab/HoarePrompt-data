Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of occurrences of the character `chr(i + ord('A'))` in the string `a`, `i` is 0. If `count[0]` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[0]`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains 0.***
