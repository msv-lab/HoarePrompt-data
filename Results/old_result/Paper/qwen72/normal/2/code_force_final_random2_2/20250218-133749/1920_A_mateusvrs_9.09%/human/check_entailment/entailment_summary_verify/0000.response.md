### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). This ensures that `ax` and `bx` will be updated correctly as the constraints are processed.
   - The use of `1000000000.0 + 7` for `ax` is a bit unusual but effectively serves the purpose of setting an initial upper bound that is larger than any possible `x` value (since `x` is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^9\)).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This correctly sets the lower bound for `k`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This correctly sets the upper bound for `k`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This correctly keeps track of all values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list. This is correct because if the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, no integer can satisfy both bounds simultaneously.

4. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the number of invalid `k` values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done using the formula `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of invalid `k` values in the range.
   - The loop that iterates over `cx` to count the invalid `k` values is necessary and correctly implemented.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case. The use of `print(*r, sep='\n')` ensures that each result is printed on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints for each test case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
