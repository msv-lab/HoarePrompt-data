The code initializes a list `cnt` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means `cnt` will have indices ranging from 0 to `n`, inclusive, and each element will initially be 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers derived from user input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
