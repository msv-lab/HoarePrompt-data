Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `one_perc` based on the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions for `c1` and `final` remain as described in the initial state.
