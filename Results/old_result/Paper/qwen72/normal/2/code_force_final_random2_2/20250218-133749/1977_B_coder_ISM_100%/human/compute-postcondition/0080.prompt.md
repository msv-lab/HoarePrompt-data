Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements. The list `s` has been modified such that any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` was set have been flipped to '1'. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is flipped to '1', `length` is 31, and `s` contains 31 elements with the last element being '1'. If `flag` is not set or `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 30, and `s` contains 30 elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not. If the first character of the string `s` is '-1' and the second character of the string `s` is '0', then the first character of the string `s` is '-1' and the second character of the string `s` is '0'. Otherwise, the first character of the string `s` is not '-1' or the second character of the string `s` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not. If the third character of the string `s` is '-1' and the second character of the string `s` is '1', then the first character of the string `s` is '-1', the second character of the string `s` is '-1', and the third character of the string `s` is '0'. Otherwise, the first character of the string `s` is not '-1' or the second character of the string `s` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30 or 31, and the conditions on the string `s` remain unchanged. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[3]` is '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
