Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts of substrings. The approach taken by the function `func_1` involves identifying and swapping '1's and '0's in the string to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's, which is a valid strategy for sorting the string.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Mechanism**: The function attempts to swap elements directly when a '1' is found at the left pointer and a '0' is found at the right pointer. This approach does not correctly simulate a cyclic shift of a substring. A cyclic shift should move the last element of the substring to the front and shift all other elements to the right. Direct swapping does not achieve this effect and may lead to incorrect results.

2. **Loop Conditions and Pointer Movements**: The conditions in the while loop and the movements of the `left` and `right` pointers are not optimal. The loop continues as long as `left <= right`, which can lead to infinite loops if the pointers are not properly managed. Additionally, the way the pointers are incremented (`right += 1` and `left += 1`) does not guarantee that all elements are processed correctly.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` is intended to account for the length of the substring being shifted. However, since the actual cyclic shift is not performed, this cost calculation may be incorrect.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
