The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The initial state provides context about various variables and conditions, but none of these affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
