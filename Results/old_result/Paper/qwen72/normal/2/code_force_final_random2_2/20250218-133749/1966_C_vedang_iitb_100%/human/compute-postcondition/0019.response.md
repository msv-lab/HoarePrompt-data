Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `mexsize % 2` to decide what will be printed.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize` that is not in the list.
   - Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers, the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not in the list `a` could be any positive integer depending on the contents of `a`.

4. **Determining `mexsize % 2`:**
   - If `mexsize` is even, the print statement will output 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, the print statement will output 'Bob'.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize`. However, we know that `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not in the list `a` and it is greater than `maxsize`.
   - Therefore, the output will depend on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize` from the given information, we can only describe the output based on the condition:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`)**
