To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.
- `z` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.
- `adj[a]` now includes `b`.
- `adj[b]` now includes `a`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains the same, but it must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**
