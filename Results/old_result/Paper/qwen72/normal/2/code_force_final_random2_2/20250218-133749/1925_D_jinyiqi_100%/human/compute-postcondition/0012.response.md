Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial state conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are now the input integers read from the input.
