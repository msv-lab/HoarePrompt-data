The value `1 << idx` is removed from the list `nums`. The value `1 << idx` represents a bit shift operation that shifts the number 1 to the left by `idx` positions, effectively calculating `2^idx`. The rest of the list `nums` remains unchanged, including the newly appended elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The variable `idx` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is the original list with the new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended to it, but with the value `2^idx` removed, and `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).**
