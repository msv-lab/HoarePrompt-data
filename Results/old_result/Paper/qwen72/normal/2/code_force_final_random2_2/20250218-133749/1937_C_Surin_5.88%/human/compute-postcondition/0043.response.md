The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration), making `i` 3. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
