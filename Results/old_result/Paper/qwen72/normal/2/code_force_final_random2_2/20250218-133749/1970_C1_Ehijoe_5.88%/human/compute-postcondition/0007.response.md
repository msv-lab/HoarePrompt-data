Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[u]`, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, and the condition `empty` is True.**

Explanation:
- The value of `u` is appended to the deque `tree`.
- The deque `tree` now contains the single element `[u]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
