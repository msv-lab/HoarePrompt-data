Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1, while the conditions on `n` and the relationship between `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and `curr_v` remain unchanged.
