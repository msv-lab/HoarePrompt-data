Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is the new input string.
- `op` is 0.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `1`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **1**
