The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 1), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.**
