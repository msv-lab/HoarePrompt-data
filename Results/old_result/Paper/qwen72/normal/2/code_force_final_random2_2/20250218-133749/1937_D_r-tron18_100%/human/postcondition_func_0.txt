The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where `0 <= times <= len(arr)`). It returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)` from the end of `arr`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. In other words, it calculates the difference between the last element and an element that is `times` positions before the last element, ensuring that the index does not go out of bounds.
