The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the end of the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `info` is a list containing two elements
- `j` is 1
- `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[1]`, `arr` is `[1]`, and `lex` is reduced by 1.
  - If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` is reduced by 26.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.

After executing `arr.append(26)`, the value `26` is added to the end of `arr`.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 1, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 79, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28.**
