Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 2, `flag` is False, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', then `j` is 1 and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and `flag` remains False.***
