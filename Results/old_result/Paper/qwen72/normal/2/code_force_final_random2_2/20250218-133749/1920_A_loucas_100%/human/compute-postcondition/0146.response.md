Postcondition: ***`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the second element of `no`, `innerLoop` is the input integer. If `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.***
