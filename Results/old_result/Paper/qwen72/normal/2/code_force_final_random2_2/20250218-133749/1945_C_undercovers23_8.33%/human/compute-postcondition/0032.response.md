The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `i` is 1.
- `lst` initially contains `[1]`.

Therefore, `i + 1` is `2`, and appending `2` to `lst` results in `lst` being `[1, 2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0'; otherwise, `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is `[1, 2]`.**
