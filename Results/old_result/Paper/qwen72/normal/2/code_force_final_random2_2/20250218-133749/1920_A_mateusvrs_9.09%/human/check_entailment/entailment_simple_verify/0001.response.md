### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values that `k` should not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and subtracts the number of invalid values in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Bounds Calculation**:
  - The function correctly updates the lower bound `bx` and the upper bound `ax` based on the constraints. This ensures that the bounds are correctly set for each test case.
  
- **Invalid Values Handling**:
  - The function correctly identifies and excludes the invalid values from the set `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done by iterating through the set `cx` and checking if each value falls within the range `[bx, ax]`.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The function correctly checks if the bounds are feasible (`bx < ax`). If the bounds are not feasible, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, which is the correct behavior.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The function correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values from the total range. The formula `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is correct, where `tmp` is the count of invalid values within the range.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
