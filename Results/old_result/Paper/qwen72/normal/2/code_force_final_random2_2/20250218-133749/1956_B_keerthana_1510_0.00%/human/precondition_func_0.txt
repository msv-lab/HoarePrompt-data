t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
