To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 3.
2. `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, where `k` is a positive integer.
3. `cnt` is 0.
4. `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
5. `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
6. `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
7. `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3.
- The variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value from the context.
- The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`, which means it will print the string `!` followed by the product of `i` and `v`.

### Determining `v`:
- The initial state does not provide a direct value for `v`.
- However, since `l` is equal to `n + 1` and `l` is also `func_2() + 1`, we can infer that `func_2()` must be equal to `n`.
- Given that `func_2()` must be less than `n`, this creates a contradiction unless `func_2()` is not used in the print statement directly.

### Conclusion:
- Since `v` is not defined in the initial state and there is no information about its value, we cannot determine the exact value of `v`.
- Therefore, the output will include the string `!` followed by the product of `i` (which is 3) and an unknown value `v`.

### Final Output:
Output: **! 3 * v (where v is an undefined variable)**
