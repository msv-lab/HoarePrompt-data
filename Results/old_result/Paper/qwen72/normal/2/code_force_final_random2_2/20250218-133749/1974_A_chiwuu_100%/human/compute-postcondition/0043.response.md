Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `t` is equal to `b`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is equal to `b * 15 - b * 4`.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be equal to `b`. The value of `t1` is recalculated using the new value of `t`, which is now `b`, making `t1` equal to `b * 15 - b * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
