Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(b[0])` adds the first element of the list `b` to the list `l`.
- Initially, `l` was an empty list, so after the execution, `l` contains the first element of `b`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
