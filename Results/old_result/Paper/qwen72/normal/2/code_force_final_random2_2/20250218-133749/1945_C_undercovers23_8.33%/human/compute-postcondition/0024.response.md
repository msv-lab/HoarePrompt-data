The code `lst.append(i + 1)` adds the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

- `i` is currently 0.
- `i + 1` evaluates to 1.
- `lst` is initially an empty list, so after appending `1`, `lst` becomes `[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is `[1]`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Additionally, the percentage of '0's up to the current index (`zero_perc`) is at least 50%, and the percentage of '1's from the next index to the end of the string (`one_perc`) is also at least 50%.**
