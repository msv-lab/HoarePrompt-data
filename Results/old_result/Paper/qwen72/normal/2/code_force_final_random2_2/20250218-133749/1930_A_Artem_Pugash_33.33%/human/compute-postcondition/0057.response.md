Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 2 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numCases`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Initially a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, it becomes empty after all iterations of the loop because each iteration removes two elements from the list.
- **`suma`**: Initially 0, it accumulates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`. After all iterations, `suma` will be the sum of these minimum values.
