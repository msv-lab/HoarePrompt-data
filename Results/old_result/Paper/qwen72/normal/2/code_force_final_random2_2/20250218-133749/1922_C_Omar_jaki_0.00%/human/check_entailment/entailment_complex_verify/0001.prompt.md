You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `a` has been updated for each test case to a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the city positions read from input, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` for each test case contains the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The variable `u` is 0, indicating that all queries for the current test case have been processed. The variables `n`, `m`, and `queries` remain unchanged for each test case. The values of `c` and `d` are the last values returned by `r()` before `u` became 0 for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities positioned on a number line and a series of queries about the distances between specific pairs of cities. For each test case, it reads the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It then calculates and prints the cumulative sums of certain conditions based on the distances between consecutive city positions. Finally, it processes each query by calculating and printing the distance between the specified cities. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all input has been consumed and all results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and their positions `a`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **City Position Handling:**
   - The positions of the cities are stored in the list `a`, with padding at the beginning and end to handle edge cases.
   - The list `b` is initialized to store cumulative costs for traveling to the closest city.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates over the cities using `zip` to access four consecutive elements at a time.
   - For each city, it calculates the cost to travel to the next city and updates the cumulative cost in `b`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it determines the minimum cost to travel from city `c` to city `d` by using the precomputed cumulative costs in `b`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `a` is padded with very large negative and positive values to handle edge cases where the closest city might be the first or last city.
  - `b` is initialized to store cumulative costs.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The loop iterates over the cities and calculates the cost to travel to the next city.
  - The condition `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` ensures that the cost is added only if the current city is closer to the next city than to the previous or next-next city.

- **Query Processing:**
  - For each query, it uses the precomputed cumulative costs in `b` to find the minimum cost to travel from city `c` to city `d`.
  - If `c < d`, it calculates the cost from `c` to `d`.
  - If `c > d`, it calculates the cost from `d` to `c`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The padding with very large values in `a` ensures that edge cases are handled correctly.
- **Cumulative Cost Calculation:**
  - The logic for updating `b` seems correct, but the use of `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is a bit unconventional and might be hard to understand. However, it effectively adds the cost `v` if the condition is true.
- **Query Processing:**
  - The query processing logic is correct and efficiently uses the precomputed cumulative costs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the edge cases and efficient query processing. Therefore, the program is correct.
