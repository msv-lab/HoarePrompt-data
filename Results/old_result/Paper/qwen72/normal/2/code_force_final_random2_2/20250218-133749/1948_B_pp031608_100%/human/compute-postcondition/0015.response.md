Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` remains True unless the conditions within the loop body cause it to change, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**
