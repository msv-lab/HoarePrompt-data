### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, in which case it breaks out of the loop.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks the ship and increments `sunks`.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both the first and last ships. If so, it updates `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` accordingly.
   - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar checks and updates.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship or when `k` is insufficient to sink any more ships.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Correctness:
After reviewing the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
