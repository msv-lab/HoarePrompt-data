Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop, where each `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b` if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` assigns the integer value of `info[0]` to `a` and the integer value of `info[1]` to `b`.
- The initial state already specifies that `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, so these assignments do not change the values of `a` and `b`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with `a` and `b` explicitly stated as their respective integer values from `info`.
