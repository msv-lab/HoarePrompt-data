To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while R - L > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `R` and `L`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`
- `z` is 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input
- `x` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `x` is 25000
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call
- `numCuts` is 0
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is equal to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `R` is 25000

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `R - L > 1` must still hold true. This means that the values of `R` and `L` must be such that their difference is greater than 1.

Since the exact values of `R` and `L` are not provided, we need to ensure that the condition `R - L > 1` remains true. Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for `R` and `L` beyond ensuring that their difference is greater than 1.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `x` is 25000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`**
