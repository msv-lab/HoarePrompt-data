To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `d` contains each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element.
- `shapes` is 0 if the count of the element `j` in the dictionary `d` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is 1.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in pl:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `pl`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the list `pl` must have at least one more element to iterate over.
- The variable `j` is the current element being iterated over in `pl`.

### State Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `pl` must have at least 1 element.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 2 elements.
- The value of `j` will be the next element in `pl`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `pl` and the value of `j`.
- The other variables (`d`, `shapes`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`d` contains each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `pl`, `shapes` is 0 if the count of the element `j` in the dictionary `d` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln` remain unchanged.**
