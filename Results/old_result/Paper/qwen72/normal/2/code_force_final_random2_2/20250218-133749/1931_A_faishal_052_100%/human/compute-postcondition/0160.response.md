To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `range` is 3.

2. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is constructed by converting the elements of `info[2]` to their corresponding ASCII characters and then concatenating them.
   - Specifically, `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96` are used to get the ASCII values.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `info[2]` is a sorted array, let's assume it contains three elements, say `[a, b, c]`.
   - The ASCII values of these elements plus 96 will be:
     - `chr(info[2][0] + 96)`
     - `chr(info[2][1] + 96)`
     - `chr(info[2][2] + 96)`

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - If `info[2] = [1, 2, 3]`, then:
     - `info[2][0] + 96 = 1 + 96 = 97` -> `chr(97) = 'a'`
     - `info[2][1] + 96 = 2 + 96 = 98` -> `chr(98) = 'b'`
     - `info[2][2] + 96 = 3 + 96 = 99` -> `chr(99) = 'c'`
   - Therefore, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

5. **General Case:**
   - Without knowing the exact values of `info[2]`, we can generalize that `temp` will be a string of three characters, where each character is the result of converting the corresponding element of `info[2]` plus 96 to its ASCII character.

Given the initial state and the construction of `temp`, the output of the `print(temp)` statement will be a string of three characters derived from the elements of `info[2]` plus 96.

Output: **temp (where temp is a string of three characters derived from the elements of info[2] plus 96)**
