The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `suma` is now `a + (a - 2) // 4 + 1` if `a` is not 1, otherwise `suma` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**
