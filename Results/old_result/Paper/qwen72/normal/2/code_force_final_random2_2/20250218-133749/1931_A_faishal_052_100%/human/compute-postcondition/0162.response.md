The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing an encoded word. For each test case, the function outputs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, each on a new line.

Functionality: **The function reads from stdin a series of test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n`. For each `n`, the function outputs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, each on a new line.**
