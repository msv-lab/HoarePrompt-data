Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is a new input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
