Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `u` is not 0, `v` is even, `v` is non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is `val >> 28 & 1`, `a` is a list that must have at least one element, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` remains 28, `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`, `a` remains a list that must have at least two elements, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If the new `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` remains 28, `u` remains `x >> 28 & 1` (and `u` is not 0), `v` remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` (and `v` is even and non-zero), `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)` (where `val` is the next element in `a`), `a` remains a list that must have at least one element, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans` remain unchanged. If the new `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
