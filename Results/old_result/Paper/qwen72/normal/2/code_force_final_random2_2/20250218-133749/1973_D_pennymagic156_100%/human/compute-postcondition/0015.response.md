To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

- The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
- The loop condition is `i > 0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`. Since `i` is part of the loop head, it is the only variable that needs to be adjusted.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`, and `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will set `i` to `n - 2`.

The state of `v` and the function `func_2()` are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `v` remains the return value of `func_2()` unless `v` equals `n`, in which case `v` is updated to `n - 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
