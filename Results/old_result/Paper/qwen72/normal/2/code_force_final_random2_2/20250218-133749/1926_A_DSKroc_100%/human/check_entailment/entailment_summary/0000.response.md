Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. It then compares these counts and prints the character that appears more frequently. The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input, counting the characters, and printing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
