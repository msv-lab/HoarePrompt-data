Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders named with digits, and some of these subfolders may contain .html files. t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits, some of these subfolders may contain .html files, t must be greater than 0, n is an input integer, s is an input string, and cnt1 is the number of occurrences of '1' in s. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, if cnt1 is greater than 2 and is odd, or cnt1 is 1, the condition is met. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 or is even, and '11' is in s, the string '11' is present in s; otherwise, '11' is not a substring of s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits, some of these subfolders may contain .html files, t must be greater than 0, n is an input integer, s is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is odd, or `cnt1` is 1, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or is even, and '11' is in `s`, the string '11' is present in `s`; otherwise, '11' is not a substring of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: start and end are integers where start <= end, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits, some of which may contain .html files, t must be greater than 0, n is an input integer, s is the new input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is an even number, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and is odd, or `cnt1` is 1, the condition is met. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or is even, and '11' is in the new `s`, the string '11' is present in the new `s`; otherwise, '11' is not a substring of the new `s`. Regardless of the condition, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
