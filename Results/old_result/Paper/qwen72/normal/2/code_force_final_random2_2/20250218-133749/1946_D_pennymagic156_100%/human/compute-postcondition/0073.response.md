Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`. If `op` (the 29th bit of `val`) is 0, then `ai` is 0 and `t` now contains `val` as its last element. Otherwise, `ai` remains `val` and `t` is unchanged.***
