The value `1 << j` is calculated, which is `1 << 0` since `j` is 0. This results in `1`. This value is then appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
