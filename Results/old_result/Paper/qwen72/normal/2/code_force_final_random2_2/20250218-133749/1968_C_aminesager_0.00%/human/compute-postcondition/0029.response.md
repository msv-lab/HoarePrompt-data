Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T[:n-1])], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but not modified within the loop.
- **`line`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used to initialize `T`.
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is derived from `line` and not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` starts with `[1000]` and grows with each iteration of the loop. After `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements. Each element is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`. The final element in `a` will be `1000 - sum(T[:n-1])`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- **`result`**: This is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces. The final value of `result` will reflect the contents of `a` after the loop has completed.
