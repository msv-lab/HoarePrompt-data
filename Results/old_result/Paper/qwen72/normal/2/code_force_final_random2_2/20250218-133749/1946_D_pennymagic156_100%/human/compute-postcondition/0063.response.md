The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
