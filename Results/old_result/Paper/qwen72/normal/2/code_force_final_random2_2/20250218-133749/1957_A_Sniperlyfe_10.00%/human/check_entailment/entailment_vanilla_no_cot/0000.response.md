Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be constructed, but the problem statement asks for the maximum number of regular polygons (which can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3). The code divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which is specific to constructing squares. To correctly solve the problem, the code should consider the construction of polygons with any number of sides (3 or more), not just 4-sided polygons.

A corrected version of the function would need to find the maximum number of polygons for each possible number of sides (from 3 upwards) and then sum these values to get the total maximum number of polygons. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    max_polygons = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            max_polygons += count // sides
    return max_polygons
```

This function iterates over each unique stick length and for each length, it calculates how many polygons of different sides (starting from 3) can be formed and adds this to the total count. This ensures that all possible regular polygons are considered, not just squares.
