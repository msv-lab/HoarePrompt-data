Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is either 0 if `bx` â‰¥ `ax` for the corresponding test case, or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax` for the corresponding test case. `n` is 0, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 1 for the last test case, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs with `a` being 2 for the last test case (or 1000000007 if no such input was given), `cx` is a set containing all unique values from the inputs with `a` being 3 for the last test case, and `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax` for the last test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` is now 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The list `r` contains `t` elements, where each element corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the maximum value of `x` for type 1 constraints (`bx`) is greater than or equal to the minimum value of `x` for type 2 constraints (`ax`), the element is 0. Otherwise, the element is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique values from type 3 constraints that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- The variable `n` is 0 because it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- The variables `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, and `tmp` reflect the final state of these variables for the last test case processed by the loop. Specifically:
  - `bx` is the maximum value of `x` for type 1 constraints in the last test case.
  - `ax` is the minimum value of `x` for type 2 constraints in the last test case, or 1000000007 if no type 2 constraints were present.
  - `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` for type 3 constraints in the last test case.
  - `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` for the last test case.
