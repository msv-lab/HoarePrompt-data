Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 1 + 1`. If `c` is 0 in the else part, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 5`. If `c` is 1 in the else part, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `3 * zeroes - 1`.***
