Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if n <= x // i:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        elif n <= i:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is set to `max(0, x // i)`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is now 2, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 2. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `i` is 3. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` <= `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, and `n` > `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`. If `x % i != 0`, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1` without updating `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
