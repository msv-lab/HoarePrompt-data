Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is updated to `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 27, or `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is between 2 and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, `arr` is updated to contain the element 26 appended to its previous contents, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` remains unchanged.***
