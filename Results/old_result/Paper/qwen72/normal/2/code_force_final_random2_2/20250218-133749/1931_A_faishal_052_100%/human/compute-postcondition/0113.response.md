Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 1, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is between 28 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` (after reduction) is greater than or equal to 79, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` contains two elements both of which are the array `[]`, `arr` is `[26]`, and `lex` remains unchanged.***
