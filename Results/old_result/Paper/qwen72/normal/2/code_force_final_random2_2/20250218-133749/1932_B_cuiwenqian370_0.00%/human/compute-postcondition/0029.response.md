Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- `t` is 0.
- `n` is the integer value of the last `n` processed.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `path` is the string at the last `path` processed.
- `index` is the final index after processing all elements.
- `results` is a list containing at least two results of `func_1(path)`.
- `result` is the second result in the `results` list.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the second result from the `results` list. Since `results` is a list containing at least two results of `func_1(path)`, the value of `result` will be the second element of this list.

Output: **result (where result is the second result in the `results` list, and `results` is a list containing at least two results of `func_1(path)`)**
