Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string respectively, and `h` is not equal to 0, and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

The code snippet `day = 'AM'` sets the variable `day` to the string 'AM'. Since this was already the case in the initial state, no changes occur to the variables. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
