Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is a new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is 0.
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(m + p)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `m`**: It is explicitly set to 0.
2. **Variable `p`**: This is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the updated string `s`.
3. **String `s`**: The string `s` is derived from a new input string where all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The exact value of `s` depends on the input string, but it is guaranteed that 'map' is not present in `s`.

### Calculation:
- The value of `m` is 0.
- The value of `p` is the count of 'pie' in the updated string `s`.

### Final Output:
The `print(m + p)` statement will print the sum of `m` and `p`. Since `m` is 0, the output will simply be the value of `p`.

Output: **p (where p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the updated string s)**
