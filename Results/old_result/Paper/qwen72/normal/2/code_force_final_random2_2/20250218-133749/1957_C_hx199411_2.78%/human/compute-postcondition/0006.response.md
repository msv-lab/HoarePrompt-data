The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts using a space as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `c` and `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `num` is 0
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the variables `c` and `r` are assigned new values based on the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers from user input.**
