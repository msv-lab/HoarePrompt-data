Output State: **`nums` is the original list with the new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended to it, but with the value `2^idx` removed, `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
