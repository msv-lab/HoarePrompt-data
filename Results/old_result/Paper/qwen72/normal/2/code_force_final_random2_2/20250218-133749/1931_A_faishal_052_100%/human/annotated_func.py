#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. The function should output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case, each on a new line.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` will be an integer between 1 and 100, `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, `info` will be a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr`. Each `arr` will contain three elements, where the first two elements are either 1 or 26 (depending on the value of `lex` during the iteration), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the operations inside the loop. The exact values of the elements in each `arr` depend on the input values of `lex` provided during each iteration.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is equal to `cases - 1`, `info` is a list containing `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2, and `range` is 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) is provided, representing an encoded value. The function processes each `n` to determine and print the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, with each word printed on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state includes the variable `cases` holding the number of test cases, `info` containing a list of sorted arrays, each with three elements derived from the input, and `i` and `j` holding the last indices used in the loops.
