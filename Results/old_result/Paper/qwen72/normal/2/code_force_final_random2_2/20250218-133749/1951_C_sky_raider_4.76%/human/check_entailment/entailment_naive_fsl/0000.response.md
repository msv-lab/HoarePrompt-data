Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the calculation of the cost `c`. Specifically, the initialization of `c` as `k * k / 2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements. Additionally, the update to `c` inside the loop is also incorrect. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid representation of the initial cost. The initial cost should be zero since no tickets have been purchased yet.

2. **Update of `c`**:
   - The update to `c` inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly account for the cost of purchasing tickets. The correct update should be `c += l[i] * s`.

3. **Handling of `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is used to track the remaining number of tickets to be purchased. The loop should continue until `k` reaches zero, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += l[i] * s
            k -= s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(c)
```

This corrected version initializes `c` to zero and updates it correctly by adding the cost of the tickets purchased each day. It also ensures that the loop stops once all required tickets are purchased (`k` becomes zero). This version should work correctly for all potential cases.
