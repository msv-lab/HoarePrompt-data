Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the first element of the list `a`. If `sz` (the first element of the list `a`) is 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
