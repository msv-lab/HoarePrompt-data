Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `line` is a new string input by the user.
4. `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.
5. `a` is a list constructed as follows:
   - The first element is `1000 - sum(T[:n-1])`.
   - The next elements are `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, `(1000 - T[0]) - T[2]`, ..., up to `(1000 - T[0]) - T[n-1]`.
   - The last element is `1000 - T[0]`.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Conversion:**
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `line` is a string input by the user.
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each part to an integer.

2. **List `a` Construction:**
   - The first element of `a` is `1000 - sum(T[:n-1])`.
   - The next elements are calculated as `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, `(1000 - T[0]) - T[2]`, ..., up to `(1000 - T[0]) - T[n-1]`.
   - The last element is `1000 - T[0]`.

3. **String `result` Construction:**
   - Each element of the list `a` is converted to a string.
   - These strings are joined with spaces to form the final string `result`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 3`
- `line = "100 200 300"`

1. **Convert `line` to `T`:**
   - `T = [100, 200, 300]`

2. **Construct `a`:**
   - First element: `1000 - sum(T[:2]) = 1000 - (100 + 200) = 700`
   - Second element: `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1] = (1000 - 100) - 200 = 700`
   - Third element: `(1000 - T[0]) - T[2] = (1000 - 100) - 300 = 600`
   - Last element: `1000 - T[0] = 1000 - 100 = 900`

   So, `a = [700, 700, 600, 900]`

3. **Construct `result`:**
   - Convert each element of `a` to a string: `["700", "700", "600", "900"]`
   - Join these strings with spaces: `"700 700 600 900"`

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is the space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`.

Output: **700 700 600 900 (where the elements are derived from the list `a` as described above)**
