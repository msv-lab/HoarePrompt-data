To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and `el` is '>'.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` which is 0.
   - `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet calculates `oneInd` using the formula: `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `oneInd` is calculated and assigned a new value.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculating `oneInd`:**
   - `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which represents the cumulative sum of all indices of '>' in `s1`.
   - `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that we assume returns a value based on the list `preOne` and the argument 1. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we will denote its return value as `func_1_result`.

   Therefore, the calculation is:
   ```python
   oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result
   ```

### Output State:
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n - 1` in `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` which is 0, `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.**
