Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Logic for Finding Suitable `k` Values**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - It checks if `y` is odd. If it is, no `k` values can satisfy the condition, so it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it proceeds to find the possible `k` values using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `q` and `x` as parameters.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store potential `k` values.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds it to `M`.
   - It iterates through all integers `i` from 1 to the square root of `q`, checking if `i` is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a divisor and meets the condition `i >= x - 1`, it adds `i` to `M`. Similarly, it checks if `q // i` meets the condition and adds it to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The program calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to get the initial list of `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x` to get additional `k` values.
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates using `set`, and prints the length of the resulting list.

This approach ensures that all possible `k` values are considered and that the solution is efficient even for large inputs. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
