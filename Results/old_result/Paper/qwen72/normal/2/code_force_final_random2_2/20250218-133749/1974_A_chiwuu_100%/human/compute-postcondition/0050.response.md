The code snippet `t = t + t2 // 15` updates the value of `t` by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `t2` is defined as `a - t1`.
- `t1` is defined as `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
- The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd.
- `t2` is `a - t1`.

The value of `t` is updated as follows:
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.

Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we can only say that `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.**
