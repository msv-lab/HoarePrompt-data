The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is `k - 2`, so after the decrement, `cnt` becomes `k - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`).**
