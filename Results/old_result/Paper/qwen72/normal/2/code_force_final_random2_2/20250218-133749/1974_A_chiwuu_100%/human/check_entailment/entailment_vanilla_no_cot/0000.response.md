Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios for placing the icons on the minimum number of screens. Specifically, the approach taken to calculate the number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by 2 and then adjusting for odd values. This is incorrect because a single screen can hold up to 3 (15/5) 2x2 icons, not just 2.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space**: The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing 2x2 icons and then tries to fit 1x1 icons into this space. However, the calculation of the remaining space and the subsequent addition of screens for 1x1 icons is not accurate.

3. **Inefficient Use of Screen Space**: The program does not efficiently use the available space on the screens. For example, it might leave unused space that could have been used for additional 1x1 icons.

A more accurate approach would involve:

- Calculating the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen.
- Placing as many 2x2 icons as possible on the minimum number of screens.
- Using the remaining space on these screens to place 1x1 icons.
- If there are still 1x1 icons left, calculating the additional screens needed for them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3  # Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        a -= min(a, remaining_space)
        
        # Calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (a + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons
        
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of screens is used efficiently for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
