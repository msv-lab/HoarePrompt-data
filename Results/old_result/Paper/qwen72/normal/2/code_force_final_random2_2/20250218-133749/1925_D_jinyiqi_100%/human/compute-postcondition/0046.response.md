To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is `new_n`
- `m` is `new_m`
- `k` is `new_k`
- `sum_f` is 0
- `j` is `m-1`
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0, and `j` should start from 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 0 and ensure `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
