The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` updates the value of `soma_b` by adding the element at index `i` of `lista_B` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. The value of `soma_b` is updated by adding the third element (index 2) of `lista_B` to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, `soma_b` is the sum of its initial value and the third element of `lista_B`, `pref` is either the sum of the first and second elements of `lista_A` or the first element of `lista_A` or 0 depending on the initial comparison.**
