The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a`, calculates the count of the median element in the sorted list, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no value is returned. The state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the counts of the median elements for each test case have been printed.
