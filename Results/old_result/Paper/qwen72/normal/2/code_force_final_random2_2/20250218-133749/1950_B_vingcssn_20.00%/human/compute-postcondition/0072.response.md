The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##..##'`. The initial state describes the values of variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **##..##**
