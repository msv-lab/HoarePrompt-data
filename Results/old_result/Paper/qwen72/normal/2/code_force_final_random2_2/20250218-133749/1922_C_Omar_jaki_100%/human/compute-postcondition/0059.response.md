Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**: Has 4 elements.
2. **Variable `w`**: Set to `-1000000000.0`.
3. **Variable `x`**: Set to the new value of `c`.
4. **Variable `y`**: Set to the new value of `d`.
5. **Variable `z`**: Set to `2000000000.0`.
6. **Variable `v`**: Set to `d - c` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
7. **List `b`**: Extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
8. **Variable `u`**: Set to `True`.
9. **Condition**: `c` is less than `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b`**:
   - Initially, `b` is a list with some elements.
   - It is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`.
   - Let's denote the original length of `b` as `len_b`.
   - After extension, the new elements are added at indices `len_b` and `len_b + 1`.

2. **Indices in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` gives an index in the list `b`.
   - The expression `(c - 1) * 2` also gives an index in the list `b`.

3. **Values at Indices**:
   - Since `c` is less than `d`, `(d - 1) * 2` will be greater than `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` refer to specific elements in the list `b`.

4. **New Elements in `b`**:
   - The new elements added to `b` are `b[-2] + (d - c)` at indices `len_b` and `len_b + 1`.
   - These new elements are the last two elements of the list `b`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The print statement calculates the difference between the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - Given the structure of the list `b` and the new elements added, the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` will likely refer to the new elements added to `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the structure of the list `b`, the print statement will output the difference between the elements at the specified indices. Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]) (where b[(d - 1) * 2] and b[(c - 1) * 2] are elements in the list b after it has been extended by two new elements)**.
