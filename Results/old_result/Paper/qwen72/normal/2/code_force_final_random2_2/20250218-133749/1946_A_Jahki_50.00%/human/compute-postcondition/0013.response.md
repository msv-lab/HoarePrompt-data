The code snippet `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` calculates the value of `ma` based on the value of `num2`. Given that `num2` is an even integer and is less than or equal to 10000, the division `num2 / 2` will result in an integer, and subtracting 1 from this result will give the final value of `ma`.

Since `num2` is even, `num2 / 2` will be an integer, and `int(num2 / 2)` will be the same integer. Therefore, `ma` will be `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.

For example, if `num2` is 10, then `ma` will be `int(10 / 2) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
