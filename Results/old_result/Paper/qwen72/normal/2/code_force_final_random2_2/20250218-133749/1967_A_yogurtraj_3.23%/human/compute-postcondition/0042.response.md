To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop completes.
- `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes.
- `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes.
- `k` is 0.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`r`**: This variable is described as the final value of `r` after the loop completes. Without the specific loop details, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`. However, it is a crucial part of the formula.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is provided by the user, `n` is a known value.
3. **`rem`**: This variable is described as the final value of `rem` after the loop completes. Again, without the loop details, we cannot determine the exact value of `rem`.
4. **`y`**: This variable is described as the final value of `y` after the loop completes. Similarly, without the loop details, we cannot determine the exact value of `y`.

### Calculation:
The expression to be printed is:
\[ (r - 1) \times n + 1 + rem + y \]

Given the initial state, we can only describe the values in terms of their definitions:
- `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop.
- `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y (where r, rem, and y are the final values of these variables after the loop completes, and n is the length of the list a)**
