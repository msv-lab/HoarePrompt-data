Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`.
- Since `i` is `1` and `curr` is `n`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - 1 * n`, which simplifies to `n - n`, resulting in `0`.
- All other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `i`, `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
