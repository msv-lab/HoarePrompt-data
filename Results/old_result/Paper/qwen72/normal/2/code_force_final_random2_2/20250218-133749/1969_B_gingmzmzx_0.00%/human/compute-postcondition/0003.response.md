The code snippet `zeroes = s.count(0)` counts the number of zeros in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is defined by `n` which is greater than 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, the sum of the lengths of lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`.**
