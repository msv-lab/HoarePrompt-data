The given code snippet modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `oneInd` was initially set to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
- The new value of `oneInd` is now `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The rest of the variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
