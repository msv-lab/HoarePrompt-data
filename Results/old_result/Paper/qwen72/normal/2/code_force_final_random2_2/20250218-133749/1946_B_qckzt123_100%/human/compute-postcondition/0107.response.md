The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2 and assigns the result back to `t`. Since the initial value of `t` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, we know that whatever the value of `t` was before, it is now doubled.

The other variables (`i` and `k`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is doubled.**
