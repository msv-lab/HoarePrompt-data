Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 7 (1 ≤ n - 7 ≤ 10^6). `s` does not contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'. `s` is not equal to 'mapie'. `ans` is increased by 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and since it was already increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now increased by 2 in total.
- The other conditions and variables (`s`, `n`) remain unchanged.
