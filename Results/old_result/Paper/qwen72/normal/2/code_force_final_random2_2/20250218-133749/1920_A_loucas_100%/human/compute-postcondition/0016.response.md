Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.***
