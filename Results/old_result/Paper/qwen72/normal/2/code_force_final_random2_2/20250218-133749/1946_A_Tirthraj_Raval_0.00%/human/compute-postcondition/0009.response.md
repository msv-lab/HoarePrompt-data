The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a fixed number of times determined by `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, and at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time if `t` is still greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, the value of `_` will be incremented, but since it's a placeholder, its specific value is not relevant to the state. The key is that `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`**
