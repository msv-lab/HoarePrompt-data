Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then generates a random shuffle `s2` of the string `s`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". The function does not return any value; it only performs these operations and prints the results. **
