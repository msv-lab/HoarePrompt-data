Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `j`**:
   - The original assessment mentions a discrepancy between the inner loop starting from 1 and the commented-out code suggesting it should start from 4. However, the actual problem description does not specify any such constraint. The inner loop should start from 1 to cover all possible values of \(b\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**:
   - The formula used to calculate `x`:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula is indeed incorrect. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current formula does not reflect this condition. It appears to be a heuristic or a guess that does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Summation**:
   - The summation logic:
     ```python
     suma += x
     ```
     is not correctly handling the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The subtraction of 1 at the end:
     ```python
     print(suma - 1)
     ```
     is arbitrary and not justified by the problem statement. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the program should output 1 because the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition. However, the current logic does not guarantee this.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
