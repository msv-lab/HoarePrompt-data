The only variable in the loop head is the string `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `s` contains the substring 'pie'. If `s` contains 'pie', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` may or may not contain the substring 'pie' anymore. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is reduced by 5 (1 ≤ n - 5 ≤ 10^6). `s` does not contain the substring 'map'. `s` must contain the substring 'pie'. `s` is not equal to 'mapie'. `ans` is increased by 1**
