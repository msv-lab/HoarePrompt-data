The code snippet assigns the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Given the initial state, `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`. This means the last element of `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `suffZero[-1]` is the last element of `suffZero`.
- `suffZero[-2]` is the second-to-last element of `suffZero`.
- The new value of `zeroInd` is the sum of these two elements.

Since `suffZero` has one additional element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`, the last element `suffZero[-1]` is actually `suffZero[-2] + n - 1`.

Therefore, the calculation for `zeroInd` is:
\[ \text{zeroInd} = \text{suffZero}[-1] + \text{suffZero}[-2] \]
\[ \text{zeroInd} = (\text{suffZero}[-2] + n - 1) + \text{suffZero}[-2] \]
\[ \text{zeroInd} = 2 \times \text{suffZero}[-2] + n - 1 \]

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
