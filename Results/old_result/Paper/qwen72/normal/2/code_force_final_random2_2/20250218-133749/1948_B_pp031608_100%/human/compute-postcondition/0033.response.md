Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This change affects only the variable `ans`, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial conditions of the other variables.
