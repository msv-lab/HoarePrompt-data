To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The current state indicates that `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be non-zero. Since `k` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, which means `cnt` can be zero if `k` is exactly 2. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 2 to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The current state indicates that `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `func_2()` is less than `n`, `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`. This condition is already satisfied.

Given these conditions, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 2 to keep `cnt` non-zero.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`**
