Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `odds` remains a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums. The variable `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`. The variable `idx` is `0` or `-1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The list `a` is populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the list `odds`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes:
- The list `a` will have its elements set based on the values in `odds`.
- The middle element (if `n` is odd) will be set directly to the corresponding value in `odds`.
- For all other positions, the elements will be set to half the difference between the current and previous values in `odds`.
- The variable `prev` will hold the last value processed from `odds`.
- The variable `idx` will be `0` if `n` is even, or `-1` if `n` is odd, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
