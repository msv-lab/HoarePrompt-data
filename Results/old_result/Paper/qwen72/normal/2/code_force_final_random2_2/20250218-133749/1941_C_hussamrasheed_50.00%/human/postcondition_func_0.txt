The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. It prints the sum of these two counts for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the state of the program includes the original number of test cases `t`, the last processed integer `n`, the last processed string `s` with all 'map' substrings removed, the count of 'map' in the last `s`, and the count of 'pie' in the last modified `s`.
