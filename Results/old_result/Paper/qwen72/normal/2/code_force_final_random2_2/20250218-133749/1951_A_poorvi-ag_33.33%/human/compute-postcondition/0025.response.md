Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', `results` now includes 'no' as its last element. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'no' as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('no')` adds the string 'no' to the list `results`.
- Since this operation is performed regardless of the condition mentioned in the initial state, `results` will always include 'no' as its last element after this code is executed.
- All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
