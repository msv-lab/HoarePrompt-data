Output State: **`t` is equal to `abs(y_b - y_a + 1)` if `y1` >= `y2`, or `abs(y_b - y_a - 1)` if `y1` < `y2`; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is equal to `h`; `m` is equal to `w`; `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1 + a`; `x2` is equal to `x_b`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a - 1`, `y2` remains `y_b`, and `a` is equal to `y_b - 1`; if `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a + 1`, `y2` remains `y_b`, and `a` is equal to `w - y_b`; `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
