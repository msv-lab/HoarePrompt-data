The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

- `a` is now a list of integers.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**
