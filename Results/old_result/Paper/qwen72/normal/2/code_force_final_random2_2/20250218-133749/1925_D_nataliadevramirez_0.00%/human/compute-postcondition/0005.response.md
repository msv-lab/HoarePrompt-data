To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by user input.
   - `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by user input.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer, but it does not directly affect the `print(result)` statement.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user. These values are used as parameters for the function `func_1`.
   - `friendships` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a friendship between two users. Each inner list contains integers representing user IDs.
   - `result` is the output of the function `func_1`, which processes the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact logic or computation it performs. However, we know that it takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as inputs and returns a value.

4. **Output of `print(result)`:**
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical or specific value of `result`.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the information given.

Given the above analysis, the `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The exact value of `result` depends on the logic implemented in `func_1`.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
