To determine what will be printed when the `print(L)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer read from standard input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1 read from standard input.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
   - `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `R` is `L + 1`.
   - `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `L` is the key variable here. It represents the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `R` is simply `L + 1`, but it is not directly relevant to the `print(L)` statement.
   - `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`, but it is also not directly relevant to the `print(L)` statement.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`.
   - Since `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, the output will be this specific value of `L`.

Given the initial state and the context, the output of the `print(L)` statement will be the value of `L` as described.

Output: **L (where L is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least L is less than or equal to k)**
