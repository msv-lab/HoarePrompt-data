To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n-1`, and this range must contain at least one number).

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`
- `k` is now equal to `req`
- `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice.
- `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start at 1, not `n - 1`.
- **`n`**: `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `req`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`**.
