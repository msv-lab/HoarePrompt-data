Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.***
