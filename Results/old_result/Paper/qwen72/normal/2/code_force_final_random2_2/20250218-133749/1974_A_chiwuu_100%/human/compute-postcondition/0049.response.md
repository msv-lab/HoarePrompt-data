Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(7b / 2)` if `b` is even, or `(7b / 2 + 15)` if `b` is odd, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- The value of `t1` is determined based on whether `b` is even or odd:
  - If `b` is even, `t1` is `(7b / 2)`.
  - If `b` is odd, `t1` is `(7b / 2 + 15)`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
