Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, s is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case. The sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the original `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
