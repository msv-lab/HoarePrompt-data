Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(4 * t) % MOD` % `MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD` % `MOD + t`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` to it.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
