The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i] == 'L'`, `b` now includes the element `a[l-1]` as its last element, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.**
