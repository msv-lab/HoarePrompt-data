Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `x` is greater than 0 while `y` is equal to 0.
- Additionally, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0.
- And either `x` is not equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0.

### Analysis:
1. **`x` is greater than 0**: This means `x` is a positive integer.
2. **`y` is equal to 0**: This means `y` is 0.
3. **Additional conditions**:
   - Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. Since `x` is greater than 0, this condition is satisfied because `y` is 0.
   - Either `x` is not equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. Since `x` is greater than 0, this condition is also satisfied.

Given these conditions, `x` is a positive integer, and `y` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Explanation:
- The expression `x / 15` divides `x` by 15.
- The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.

Since `x` is a positive integer, `x / 15` will be a positive floating-point number. The `math.ceil` function will round this number up to the nearest integer.

### Example Calculation:
- If `x = 15`, then `x / 15 = 1.0` and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `x = 16`, then `x / 15 ≈ 1.0667` and `math.ceil(1.0667) = 2`.
- If `x = 1`, then `x / 15 ≈ 0.0667` and `math.ceil(0.0667) = 1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a positive integer)**
