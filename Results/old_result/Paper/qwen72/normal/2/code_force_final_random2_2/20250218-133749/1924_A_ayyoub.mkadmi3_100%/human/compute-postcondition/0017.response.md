Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1, and `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `i` is no longer in the set `alphabet`, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k-1 lowercase English alphabets excluding the first character of `s` and `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the second character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.***
