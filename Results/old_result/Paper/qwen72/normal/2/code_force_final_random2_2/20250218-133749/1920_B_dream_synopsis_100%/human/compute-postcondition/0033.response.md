Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
