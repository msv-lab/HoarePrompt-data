Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string and its value is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` creates a new list `pans` and initializes it with a single element, which is the value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `mak`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
