The code snippet `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` calculates the value of `sums` based on the existing values of `sum1` and the first `x` elements of the list `a`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **`sum1`**: This is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
2. **`a[:x]`**: This is a slice of the list `a` from the start up to (but not including) the index `x`.
3. **`sum(a[:x])`**: This calculates the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.
4. **`2 * sum(a[:x])`**: This multiplies the sum of the first `x` elements by 2.
5. **`sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**: This assigns the result of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` to the variable `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0
- `x` is an integer
- `a` is a reversed list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is 0

After executing the code:
- `sums` is assigned the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
