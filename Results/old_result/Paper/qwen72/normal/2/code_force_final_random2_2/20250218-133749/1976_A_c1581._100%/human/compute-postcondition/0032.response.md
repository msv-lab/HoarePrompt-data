Output State: **The program returns False.** 

Explanation: The given condition checks if `i` is less than the length of `letters` and if the last element in `digits` is greater than the element in `letters` at index `i`. Since the code snippet explicitly returns `False`, regardless of the conditions, the output state is that the program returns `False`.
