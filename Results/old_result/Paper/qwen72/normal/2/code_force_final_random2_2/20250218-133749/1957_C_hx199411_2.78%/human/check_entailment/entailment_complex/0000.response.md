### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.

2. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - The function reads `k` moves and calculates `num` based on whether the moves are on the diagonal (`r == c`) or not.
   - For each move where `r == c`, `num` is incremented by 1.
   - For each move where `r != c`, `num` is incremented by 2.
   - This calculation is correct because each move where `r == c` only blocks one position, while each move where `r != c` blocks two positions (one for the player and one for the computer).

3. **Remaining Positions Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that are not blocked by the initial moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The base cases are correctly set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`.
   - This recurrence relation accounts for the fact that a rook can be placed in a new row or column, and the computer will mirror the move, leading to the multiplication by 2.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the result for each test case based on the value of `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
