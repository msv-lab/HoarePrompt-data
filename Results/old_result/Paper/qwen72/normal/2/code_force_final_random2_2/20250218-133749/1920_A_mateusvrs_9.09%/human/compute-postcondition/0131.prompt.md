Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` is 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, and `a` and `x` are no longer relevant. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements `[1000000008, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1 and `cx` contains `{x}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1 and `cx` contains `{x}`. The new values of `a` and `x` are the integers provided by the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of the new `x` and the current value of `bx`, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the new `x` and the current value of `bx`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
