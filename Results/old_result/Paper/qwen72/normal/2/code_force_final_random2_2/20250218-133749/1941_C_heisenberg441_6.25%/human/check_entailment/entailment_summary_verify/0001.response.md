Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". If the string already does not contain these substrings, the answer is 0.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the result.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is responsible for removing the substrings "map" and "pie" and counting the number of deletions required.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function first checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true. This is a specific edge case but not necessary for the general solution.
   - The function then enters a loop to find and remove occurrences of "map" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to find and remove occurrences of "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing the deletion count `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Loops**:
   - The loops correctly identify and remove the substrings "map" and "pie" by slicing the string at the appropriate positions.
   - Each removal operation increments the deletion count `ans` by 1, which is correct since removing one character from each occurrence of "map" or "pie" ensures the substring is no longer present.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already beautiful (does not contain "map" or "pie") by returning 0.
   - The specific check for "mapie" is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the solution.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough for the given constraints, as it processes each character in the string at most once for each type of substring.

However, there is a subtle issue with the current implementation. The function `func_1` only removes one character from each occurrence of "map" and "pie", which is incorrect. To make the string beautiful, we need to remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" in one go, not just one character. Therefore, the function should remove three characters for "map" and three characters for "pie".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 3
    return ans
```

With this correction, the function will correctly remove the entire substring "map" or "pie" and count the number of deletions accurately.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of substring removals.)
