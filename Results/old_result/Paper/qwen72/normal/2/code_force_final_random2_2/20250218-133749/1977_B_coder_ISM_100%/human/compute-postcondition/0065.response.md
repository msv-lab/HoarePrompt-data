Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements. The list `s` has been modified such that any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` was set have been flipped to '1'. If `flag` was set, `length` is 31, `s` contains 31 elements with the last element being '1', and `s[29]` is '0'. If `flag` was not set, `length` is 30, and `s` contains 30 elements. Additionally, either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
