Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the XOR of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a`, `t` is a list containing the value 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains 28 because the loop does not modify `i`.
- **`u`**: Remains `x >> 28 & 1` because the loop does not modify `u`.
- **`v`**: Remains `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])` because the loop does not modify `v`.
- **`op`**: After all iterations, `op` is the result of XORing the 29th bit of each element in `a`. This is because each iteration updates `op` with the 29th bit of the current `val`.
- **`ai`**: After all iterations, `ai` is the result of XORing all elements in `a`. This is because each iteration updates `ai` with the current `val`.
- **`t`**: If `op` is 0 after all iterations, `t` will contain the value 0 as its last element. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. This is because the loop appends `ai` to `t` only if `op` is 0 at the end of each iteration.
