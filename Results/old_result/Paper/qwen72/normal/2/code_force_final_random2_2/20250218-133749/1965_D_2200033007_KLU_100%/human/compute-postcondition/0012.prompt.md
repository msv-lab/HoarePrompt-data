You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers where every element in smallList is also in bigList, and both lists are non-empty.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, or one of the lists is empty. Every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`, but the last elements that were equal have been removed.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both of which are non-empty lists of integers where every element in `smallList` is also in `bigList`. It returns the last element of `bigList` that is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
