Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value found in the `freq` dictionary at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`.
- All other variables (`num`, `a`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
