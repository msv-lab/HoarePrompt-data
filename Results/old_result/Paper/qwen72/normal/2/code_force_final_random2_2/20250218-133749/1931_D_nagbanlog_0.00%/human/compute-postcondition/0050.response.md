The code snippet resets the value of `beautiful_count` to 0. This affects the `results` list, which previously contained the value of `beautiful_count`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is still a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is now a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**
