Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace.
- `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements, either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Data Splitting**:
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace. For example, if the input string is `"3 hello world"`, then `data` would be `['3', 'hello', 'world']`.

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. In the example above, `t` would be `3`.
   - `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`. Using the example, `index` would be `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.

3. **Results List**:
   - `results` is a list containing at least two elements, either 'YES' or 'NO'. For example, `results` could be `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet is `print(result)`, but there is no variable named `result` defined in the initial state or the code snippet. This suggests that there might be a typo or missing context.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, it seems there is a variable `result` that is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet. Therefore, the code as written will raise a `NameError` because `result` is not defined.

However, if we assume that `result` should be `results[index]` (since `results` is the only list mentioned and `index` is calculated), we can proceed with that assumption.

### Final Output:
If `result` is intended to be `results[index]`:
- `index` is `7` in the example.
- `results[7]` would be `'NO'` if `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']`.

Therefore, the output would be:
Output: **NO (where NO is the element at index 7 in the results list)**

If `result` is not intended to be `results[index]`, then the output will be:
Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
