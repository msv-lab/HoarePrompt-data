Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user. If `check_all` is True, the list `a` is non-decreasing up to the index `n-1`. If `check_all` is False, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, and the program has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. For each pair, if the element at the previous index was greater than the current element, it checked if the remaining sublist (from the current index to the end) is in non-decreasing order and if all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If both conditions were met, it printed 'YES' and broke out of the loop. If either condition was not met, it printed 'NO' and broke out of the loop. If none of these conditions were met during the entire loop, the loop completed without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If `check_all` is `True`, then all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, then there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` that are in decreasing order. Additionally, if `check_all` is `False`, the loop will print 'YES' if there exists an index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and the sublist `a[i:]` is in non-decreasing order and all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Otherwise, the loop will print 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program maintains these conditions. If `check_all` is `False`, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (`n-1`), and `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Additionally, if at any point during the loop `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop exits immediately after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` and either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
