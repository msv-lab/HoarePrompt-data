The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after executing this line, `cx` will contain the single element `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing the element `x`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2.**
