### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each row must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
     - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
     - For the remaining elements, it updates each element to the sum of its current value, 1, and the minimum value from a sublist of the previous `d+1` elements.
     - Finally, it returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost for that row.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).
     - It reads the grid and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the costs list and prints the minimum of these sums.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function correctly handles the constraints of the problem by ensuring that the first `d-1` elements are incremented and the remaining elements are updated based on the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements.
     - The final cost returned is the total cost for the row, which is correct.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
     - The logic for finding the minimum total cost is correct, as it sums every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements and prints the minimum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Both functions work together to achieve the desired result.

**Correctness: True**
