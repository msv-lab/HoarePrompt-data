Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The signs must occur sequentially, and the year of occurrence for each subsequent sign must be strictly after the previous one.

### Function 1 Analysis:
- **Input**: A list `path` where each element is a string representing a sign's periodicity.
- **Output**: The maximum value from the `dp` array, excluding any `-inf` values.

However, the function `func_1` is not correctly designed to solve the problem. It uses a dynamic programming approach to track the maximum number of '@' symbols encountered, which is irrelevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs. The function does not handle the periodicity of the signs or the sequential requirement.

### Function 2 Analysis:
- **Input**: Reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases.
- **Output**: Prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. However, it calls `func_1` with a string `path` that should be a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs. This is a misuse of `func_1`, which expects a list of strings with specific characters ('@', '*', digits).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
1. `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.
2. `func_2` incorrectly calls `func_1` with a string instead of a list of integers.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
