Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list. `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to double `temp` and increment `i` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
- When the loop exits, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled, which is equivalent to the exponent of 2 in `temp` (i.e., `temp = 2^i`).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `l1`, `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
