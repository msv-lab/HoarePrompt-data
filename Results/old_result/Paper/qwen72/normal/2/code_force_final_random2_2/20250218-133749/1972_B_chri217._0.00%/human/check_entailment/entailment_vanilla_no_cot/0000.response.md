Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win because she starts first and an odd number of 'U' coins means there will always be a move available for her when it's her turn, assuming optimal play. Conversely, if the count of 'U' coins is even, Bob will win because after Alice's first move, the number of 'U' coins will become odd, giving Bob the advantage in subsequent moves. This logic aligns with the rules and outcomes described in the problem statement.
