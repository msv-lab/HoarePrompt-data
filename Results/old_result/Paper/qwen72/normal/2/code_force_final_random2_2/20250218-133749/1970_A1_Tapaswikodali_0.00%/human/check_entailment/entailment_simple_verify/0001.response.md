### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence up to each character. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - This is verified by the annotated code, which shows that the balance is updated correctly within the loop.

2. **Details Collection**:
   - The program collects the balance, negative index, and character in a list called `details`. The use of the negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.
   - The annotated code confirms that each tuple in `details` is in the form `(balance, -i, char)`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The annotated code states that after sorting, `details` is a list of tuples sorted by balance and then by negative index, which aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.
   - The annotated code confirms that the result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` directly from the standard input, which is appropriate for the given problem description.
   - The annotated code indicates that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters `(` and `)` and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence, which is the expected output format.
   - The annotated code confirms that the final output is the balanced shuffle sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the steps required to produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
