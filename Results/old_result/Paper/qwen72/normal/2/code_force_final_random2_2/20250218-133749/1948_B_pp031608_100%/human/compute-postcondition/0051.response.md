To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49
   - `_` is a throwaway variable
   - `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `i` is `m - 3`
   - `ans` is True

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The code creates a new list `nums` by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is converted to a string, and each character (digit) is converted back to an integer and added to a list.
   - `arr[i]` is appended to this list of digits.

4. **Variables Affected:**
   - `nums` is updated with the new list of digits and the value of `arr[i]`.

5. **Output State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49
   - `_` is a throwaway variable
   - `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `i` is `m - 3`
   - `ans` is True
   - `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 49, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list formed by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appending `arr[i]` to it.**
