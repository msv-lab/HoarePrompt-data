Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum.

### Issue:
The program uses the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value. This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion, which is not the case. The correct approach should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and how their friendship value changes over the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends over the k excursions. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is the probability of selecting that pair multiplied by the increase in the friendship value. The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), and the expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

The total expected value for a pair of friends over k excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- Friendship: \( (1, 2, 1) \)

The correct expected value for this case should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

However, the program will output:
\[ 1 \times (2 \times 3 // 2) = 3 \]

This is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{5}{3} \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
