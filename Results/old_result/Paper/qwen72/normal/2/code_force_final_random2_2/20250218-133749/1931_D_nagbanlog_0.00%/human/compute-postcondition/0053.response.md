The code snippet `mod_x = num % x` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and assigns this value to `mod_x`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

The only variable that changes is `mod_x`, which is assigned the value of `num % x`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `num % x`.**
