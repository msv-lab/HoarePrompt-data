You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each connecting two nodes u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is given as an integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, and `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree.

        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is `n - 1`, `u` and `v` are the last input integers, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the nodes of the tree in a specific order where the first and last elements are the two leaves of the tree, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is odd, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if all elements in `moves` are even, the program follows the else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs a deque `tree` to represent the tree. The deque is used to maintain the order of nodes in the tree, which is essential for determining the distance from the starting node to the leaves.
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the tree by appending nodes to the deque based on the edges provided. This ensures that the tree is represented as an array-like structure, which is necessary for the game logic.

2. **Starting Node and Distance Calculation:**
   - The program reads the starting node `start`.
   - It finds the index `idx` of the starting node in the deque `tree`.
   - It calculates the number of moves to the nearest leaf from the starting node using `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. Since `t` is always 1, these calculations simplify to `idx` and `n - idx - 1`.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The program checks if either of the calculated moves is odd (`if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves])`). If at least one of the moves is odd, Ron wins because he makes the first move and will be able to make an odd number of moves.
   - If both moves are even, Hermione wins because she will be the one to make the last move.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
