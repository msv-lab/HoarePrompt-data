The value of `ans` is incremented by `m`. Since the initial state specifies that if 'B' is not present in the string `s`, `ans` is updated to `m`, and otherwise, `ans` remains 0, the code snippet `ans += m` will further increment `ans` by `m`.

- If 'B' is not present in `s`, `ans` was initially set to `m`, so after `ans += m`, `ans` will be `2 * m`.
- If 'B' is present in `s`, `ans` was initially 0, so after `ans += m`, `ans` will be `m`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a string provided by the user, `ans` is `2 * m` if 'B' is not present in `s`, otherwise `ans` is `m`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'B'.**
