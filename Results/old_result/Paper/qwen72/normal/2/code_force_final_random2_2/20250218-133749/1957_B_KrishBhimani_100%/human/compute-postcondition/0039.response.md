Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `l1`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition "if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list" is already satisfied by the initialization of `arr` as an empty list.
- The values of `ans` and `temp` are derived from the initial conditions and remain as specified.
