The code snippet `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` updates the value of `x`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is `a`.

2. **Calculation:**
   - `i * (i - 1)`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `2 * (2 - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`.
   - `a - i * (i - 1)`: This becomes `a - 2`.
   - `i ** 2`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `2 ** 2 = 4`.
   - `(a - 2) // 4`: This is the integer division of `a - 2` by 4.
   - `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`: This adds 1 to the result of the integer division.

3. **Update `x`:**
   - `x` is updated to the value of `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 2, `suma` is 0 if `a` is 1, otherwise `suma` is `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**
