To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in hmp:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

In this loop, the variable `i` iterates over the keys of the `hmp` (Counter object). For the loop to execute, `hmp` must contain at least one key. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'
- `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'
- `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`
- `i` is 'F'
- `ans` is incremented by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`

To ensure the loop executes, `hmp` must have at least one key. Since `hmp` is a Counter object derived from the string `s`, and `s` is a non-empty string, `hmp` will always have at least one key if `s` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `hmp` has at least one key, which is guaranteed by the fact that `s` is non-empty.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s` and must have at least one key, `i` is 'F', `ans` is incremented by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`**
