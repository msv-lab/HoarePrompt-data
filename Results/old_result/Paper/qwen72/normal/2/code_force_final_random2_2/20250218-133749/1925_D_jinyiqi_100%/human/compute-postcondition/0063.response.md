Output State: **After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the input integers for the last test case, `k` is the input integer for the last test case, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations for the last test case, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration of the last test case, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2` for the last test case, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd` for the last test case, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd` for the last test case, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run through all `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `sum_f` will contain the sum of all `f` values from the last test case, and `j` will be `m-1`, reflecting the last iteration of the inner loop. The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the values of the last edge processed in the last test case. The variable `cn2` will be the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items for the last test case. The variables `p` and `q` will be the numerator and denominator of the fraction calculated for the last test case, reduced to their simplest form using the greatest common divisor `gcd`. Finally, the result of the modular inverse of `q` multiplied by `p` modulo `M` will be printed for the last test case.
