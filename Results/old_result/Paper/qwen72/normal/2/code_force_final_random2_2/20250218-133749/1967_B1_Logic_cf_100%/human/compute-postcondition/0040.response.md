Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers derived from the input string such that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is 0, `T` is `t`, `ans` is the sum of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are integers derived from the input string provided during each iteration of the outer loop. The values of `n` and `m` change with each iteration based on the input.
- **`b`**: This variable is used in the inner loop and ranges from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. After the inner loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1`.
- **`t`**: This is the total number of test cases or iterations specified at the beginning. After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations.
- **`T`**: This is the loop counter for the outer loop. After all iterations, `T` will be equal to `t`, which is the total number of iterations.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the result of the computation `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each iteration. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of these results for all iterations.

Thus, after all iterations, the loop will have processed all the inputs, and the final state will reflect the completion of all iterations with the appropriate values of `n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`.
