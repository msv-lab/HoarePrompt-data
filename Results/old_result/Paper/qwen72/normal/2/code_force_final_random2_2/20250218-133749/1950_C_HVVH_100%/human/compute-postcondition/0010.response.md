Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the hour from the input string and is now `h - 12`, `m` is an integer representing the minute from the input string, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `day` is updated to 'PM'.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
