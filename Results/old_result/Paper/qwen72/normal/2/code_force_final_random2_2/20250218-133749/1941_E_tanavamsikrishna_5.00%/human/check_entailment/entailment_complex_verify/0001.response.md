### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**:
     - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
     - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
     - The final cost for the row is the value at the last cell after processing.
     - **Annotations Verification**:
       - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, ensuring that the first `d-1` supports are installed.
       - The second loop updates each element from index `d-1` to the end of the row by adding the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements (excluding the current element) plus 1.
       - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the minimum cost for the entire row.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The function correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to ensure the minimum cost for a single row.
       - The logic for handling the first `d-1` elements and the rest of the row is sound.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
     - **Annotations Verification**:
       - The input is read correctly, and the dimensions and parameters are parsed correctly.
       - The rows are processed using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge on each row.
       - The total cost for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is calculated using a sliding window approach.
       - The minimum total cost is printed.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The function correctly reads and processes the input.
       - The sliding window approach ensures that the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is found.
       - The output is printed correctly.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The output is printed correctly using `print(min(total_costs))`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints well, including the edge cases where `k` is 1 or `m` is small.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns are always included in the cost calculation.

5. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost for a single row.
   - The sliding window approach in `func_2` is correct for finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
