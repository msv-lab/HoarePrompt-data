You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each iteration, if the length of `s` is 1 or if all characters in `s` are the same, the program outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` (or a shifted version if the shuffled version matches the original `s`). The loop runs `t` times, and for each input string `s`, the conditions and outputs described above are applied.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical issue in how it handles the output for certain cases. Specifically, the program uses `print('No')` instead of `print('NO')` when the string cannot be rearranged. According to the problem description, the output should be "NO" (in uppercase), but the program outputs "No" (with a lowercase 'n'). This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string, which might not always produce a different string from the original, especially for strings with many repeated characters. The fallback mechanism `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` ensures that the string is different, but this is not a robust solution and may not always produce a valid result, especially for strings with specific patterns.

To fix these issues, the program should ensure that the output is always "NO" in uppercase and should have a more reliable method to generate a different string.
