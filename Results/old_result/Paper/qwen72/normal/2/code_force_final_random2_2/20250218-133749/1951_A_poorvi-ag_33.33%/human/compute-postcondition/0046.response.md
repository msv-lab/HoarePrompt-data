Functionality: ** The function reads a series of inputs and evaluates strings to determine if they meet certain criteria, appending 'yes' or 'no' to a results list accordingly. It then prints each element of the results list. The function does not modify the current working directory or any subfolders; it only processes input data and outputs the results. **
