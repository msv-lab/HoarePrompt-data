The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple test cases, each containing two binary strings of equal length. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, the function accepts two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`, each of length `n`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- Each character in the binary strings is either '0' or '1'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

Since the output is not specified, I will assume the function returns some result based on the processing of these binary strings for each test case. However, without specific output details, I cannot definitively state what the function returns. 

Given the typical nature of such problems, the function might return a result for each test case, possibly indicating whether certain conditions are met (e.g., if the binary strings are equal, or if they satisfy some other criteria).

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each containing two binary strings of equal length. It processes these strings and returns a result for each test case.**
