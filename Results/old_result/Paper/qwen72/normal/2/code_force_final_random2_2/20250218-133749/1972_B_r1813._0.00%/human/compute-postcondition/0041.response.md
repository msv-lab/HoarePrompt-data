Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
   - `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer.
   - `results` is a list containing at least three elements, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `data`:**
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace. For example, if the input string is `"3 yes no yes"`, then `data` would be `['3', 'yes', 'no', 'yes']`.

2. **Calculating `index`:**
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. In the example above, `t` would be `3`.
   - `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`. Using the example, `index` would be `2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.

3. **Understanding `results`:**
   - `results` is a list containing at least three elements, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. For example, `results` could be `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`.

4. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The code snippet `print(result)` is trying to print a variable `result`, but there is no such variable defined in the given context. The correct variable to print should be `results[index]`.

5. **Correcting the Code:**
   - If we assume the correct code should be `print(results[index])`, we need to check if `index` is within the bounds of the `results` list.

6. **Checking Bounds:**
   - Since `results` contains at least three elements, and `index` is calculated as `2 * t + 1`, we need to ensure that `index` does not exceed the length of `results`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state and the corrected code snippet:
```python
print(results[index])
```

- If `index` is within the bounds of `results`, the output will be the element at the `index` position in the `results` list.
- If `index` is out of bounds, it will raise an `IndexError`.

Since the exact values of `data` and `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **results[index] (where index is 2 * t + 1 and t is the integer value of data[0], and results is a list containing at least three elements, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO')**
