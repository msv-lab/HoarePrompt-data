Postcondition: ***`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is `val >> 27 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`. If `op` is 0, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing 0, 0, and 0. Otherwise, `t` remains a list containing 0 and `ai`.***
