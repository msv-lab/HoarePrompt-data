Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` incorrectly subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that could fit in the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. This calculation is flawed because it assumes that each 2x2 icon placement removes 15 possible 1x1 icon placements, which is not accurate. 

A correct approach would be to calculate the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space, considering the grid layout and the constraints of the problem. For example, if `y = 1`, the 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available for 1x1 icons. However, the current implementation incorrectly handles this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the test case `(x=1, y=1)`. The program should output `1` because one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon can fit on a single screen. However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic in the calculation.
