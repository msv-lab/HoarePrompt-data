The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'..##'` to the console. The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **..##**
