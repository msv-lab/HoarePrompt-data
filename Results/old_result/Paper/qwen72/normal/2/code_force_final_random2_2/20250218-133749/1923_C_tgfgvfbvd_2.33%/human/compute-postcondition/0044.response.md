Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4) read from input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0 (all iterations have been completed)**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input.
- The initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^4, which remains true after reading the input.
- The variables `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The variable `m` is still 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed, as specified in the initial state.
