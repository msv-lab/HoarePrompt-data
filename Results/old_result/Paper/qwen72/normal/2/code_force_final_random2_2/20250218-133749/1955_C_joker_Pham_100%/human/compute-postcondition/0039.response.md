The value of `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`. Since `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, `a[l]` will still be a positive integer after the operation. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged except for the specific elements of `a` that are modified.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.**
