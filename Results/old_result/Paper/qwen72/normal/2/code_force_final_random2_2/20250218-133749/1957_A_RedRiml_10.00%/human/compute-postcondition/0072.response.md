Postcondition: ***`d` contains each unique element from `palka` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is 0 if the count of the element `j` in the dictionary `d` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln` remain unchanged.***
