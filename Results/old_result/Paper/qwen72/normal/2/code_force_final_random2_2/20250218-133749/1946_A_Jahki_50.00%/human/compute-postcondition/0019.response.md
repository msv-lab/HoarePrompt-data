To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while new_median <= median:
```

The loop will execute if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `num2` is less than or equal to 10000
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`
- `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`

From this, we see that `median` and `new_median` are both derived from the same list `b` and the same index `ma`. Therefore, initially, `new_median` will be equal to `median`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. Since they are initially equal, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Thus, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`**
