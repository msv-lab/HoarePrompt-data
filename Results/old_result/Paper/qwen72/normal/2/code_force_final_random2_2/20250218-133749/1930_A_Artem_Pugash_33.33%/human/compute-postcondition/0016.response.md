The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to the variable `a`. The list `numbers` is now one element shorter, and the value of `a` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order and contains at least one element (with the first four elements removed), `a` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is \(2 \times \text{min}(a, b)\)**.
