Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the generation of the lexicographically smallest word for all cases. Specifically, the logic used to distribute the values among the three letters is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program uses a fixed set of conditions to distribute the value `lex` among the three letters. This approach can lead to incorrect results, especially when the value of `lex` is such that it should be distributed differently to achieve the lexicographically smallest result.

2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` after distributing the values can disrupt the order needed to form the lexicographically smallest word. The correct approach should ensure that the letters are assigned in a way that maintains the smallest possible order without needing to sort them afterward.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, particularly when the value of `lex` is close to the upper limit (78). It may incorrectly assign values that do not form the smallest possible word.

To fix these issues, a more systematic approach is needed to ensure that the values are distributed correctly to form the lexicographically smallest word. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three letters with the smallest possible values
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        remaining = lex - 3  # Subtract the initial values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to form the lexicographically smallest word
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining >= 25:
                c += 25
                remaining -= 25
            elif remaining >= 24:
                b += 24
                remaining -= 24
            else:
                a += remaining
                remaining = 0
        
        # Convert the values to characters and form the word
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the values are distributed in a way that forms the lexicographically smallest word by always trying to maximize the value of the last letter first, then the second last, and finally the first. This approach guarantees the correct and smallest possible word for any valid input.
