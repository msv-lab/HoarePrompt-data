#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is equal to the number of test cases provided initially, `i` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, 'yes' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is appended to `results`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `t` remains equal to the number of test cases provided initially, `i` is `t - 1`, and `results` is a list containing exactly `t` 'yes' or 'no' entries for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines whether the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters when `n` is odd, and always returns "no" if `n` is even. The function prints "yes" or "no" for each test case based on these conditions. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case and the program state is reset for the next run.
