The value of `ans` is incremented by `m`. The initial value of `ans` depends on whether 'B' is present in `s` or not. If 'B' is not present in `s`, `ans` was initially `2 * m`, and now it becomes `2 * m + m`. If 'B' is present in `s`, `ans` was initially `m`, and now it becomes `m + m`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a string provided by the user, `ans` is `3 * m` if 'B' is not present in `s`, otherwise `ans` is `2 * m`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C'.
