Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If the bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 0, `a` becomes an empty list, `t` contains the results of `ai` being reset to 0 whenever `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`. If `u` is 1, the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is 0. If `v` is odd, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. If `v` is even, `op` is the result of XORing the most significant bit (bit 29) of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the count of how many times `op` was 0 after processing each element in `a`, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, and `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. If `u` is 0, `op` is the XOR of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a`, `a` is a list containing the value 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, and `t` is an empty list. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `cnt`, which is the number of elements in `a` where the bit at position 28 is 1. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`. If `u` is 0, `a` is a list containing 0 for each element in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 0, `op` is the XOR of all bits at position 27 of the elements in the original `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 1, `t` is an empty list, and `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. If `u` is not 0, `u` remains as `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` remains as `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, and all other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `op`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. If `v` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of the 28th bit (from the right) of all elements in `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` was 0 during the loop's execution, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, the loop or the most internal if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
