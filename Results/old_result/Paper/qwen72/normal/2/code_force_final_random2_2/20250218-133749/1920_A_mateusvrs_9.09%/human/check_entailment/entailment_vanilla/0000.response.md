### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values that `k` should not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and the value `x` are read.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and subtracts the number of invalid values in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Bounds Calculation**: The function correctly updates the lower bound `bx` and the upper bound `ax` based on the constraints.
- **Invalid Values Handling**: The function correctly identifies and excludes the invalid values from the set `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- **Feasibility Check**: The function correctly checks if the bounds are feasible (`bx < ax`), and if not, it returns `0`.
- **Result Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values from the total range.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the requirements and edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
