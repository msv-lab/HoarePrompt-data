The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.**
