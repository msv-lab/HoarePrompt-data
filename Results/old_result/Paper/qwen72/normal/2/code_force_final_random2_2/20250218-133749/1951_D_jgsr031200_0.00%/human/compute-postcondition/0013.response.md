Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**. 

This means that the value of `curr` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
