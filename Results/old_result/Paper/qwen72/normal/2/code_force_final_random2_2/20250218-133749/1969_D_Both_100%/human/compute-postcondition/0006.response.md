The code snippet creates a new list `neg_prices` by iterating over each element in the `prices` list and negating its value. The `prices` list contains values returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.**
