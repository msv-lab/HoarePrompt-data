To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **`t`**: This is a positive integer.
2. **`n`**: This is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`.
3. **`p`**: This is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`.
4. **`input`**: This is still the function `sys.stdin.read`.
5. **`data`**: This is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
6. **`index`**: This is `1 + t + (t * n)`.
7. **`results`**: This is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least three elements.
8. **`result`**: This is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
9. **`res`**: This is the third element of `results`.

Given this information, the `print(res)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list. Since `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and it is guaranteed to have at least three elements, `res` will be the third element of this list.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **res (where res is the third element of the results list, which contains the return values of func_1(n, p) for each iteration)**
