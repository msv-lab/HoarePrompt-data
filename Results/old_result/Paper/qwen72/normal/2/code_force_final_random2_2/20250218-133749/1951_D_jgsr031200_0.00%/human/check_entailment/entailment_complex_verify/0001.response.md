### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Equality (`n == k`)**:
   - The code correctly checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES", followed by 1 and 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - This part of the code is accurate.

2. **Check for Insufficient Coins (`n < k`)**:
   - The code correctly checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.
   - This part of the code is accurate.

3. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - The code sets up two stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall is set up with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall, leaving her with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
   - The second stall is set up with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will use the remaining `k - 1` coins to buy `k - 1` more jewels, totaling `k` jewels.
   - This approach is correct and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The code prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.
   - This matches the required output format.

However, there is a potential issue in the annotated code that needs to be addressed:

- **State After the Loop**:
  - The annotation states that after the loop, `n` is 0. This is incorrect. The loop updates `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it, but `n` should not necessarily be 0 after the loop. The correct state should be that `n` is reduced by the amount spent on buying jewels from the stalls.
  - The correct state should be: `n` is reduced by the amount spent on buying jewels from the stalls, `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop, `i` is 1, and `curr` is the quotient of `n` divided by `i`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is mostly correct, but the annotation regarding the state of `n` after the loop is inaccurate. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
