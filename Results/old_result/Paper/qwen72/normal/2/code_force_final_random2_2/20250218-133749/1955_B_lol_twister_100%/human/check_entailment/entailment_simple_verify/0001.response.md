Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list of integers `l`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is a crucial step because the value `a` corresponds to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square, which is the smallest element in the matrix. This step is also correct.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all pairs `(k, h)` where `0 <= k < n` and `0 <= h < n`. This correctly reflects the construction of the progressive square based on the given rules. The loop structure and the formula used are appropriate for generating the required elements.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`. It then compares these two sorted lists to check if they are identical. If they are, it means the input list `l` can form the progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. This approach ensures that the elements in the input list match the elements in the generated progressive square, regardless of their initial order.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the function `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'. The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem description.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to handle all aspects correctly. It correctly identifies whether the given list of integers can form the progressive square for the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Final: **True**
