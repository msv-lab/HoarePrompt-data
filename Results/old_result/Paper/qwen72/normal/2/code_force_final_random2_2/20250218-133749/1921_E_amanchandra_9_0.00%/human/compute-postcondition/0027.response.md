Postcondition: ***`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. If `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.***
