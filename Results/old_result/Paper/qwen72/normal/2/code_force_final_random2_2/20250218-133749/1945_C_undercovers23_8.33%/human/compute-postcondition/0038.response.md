Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `zero` is the same as before, `one` is the same as before, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3), `one_perc` is the same as before, `lst` is the same as before.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet only updates the value of `zero_perc`.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Since `i` is 2, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 3.
- The value of `zero` remains unchanged, so `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `one`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain the same as in the initial state.
