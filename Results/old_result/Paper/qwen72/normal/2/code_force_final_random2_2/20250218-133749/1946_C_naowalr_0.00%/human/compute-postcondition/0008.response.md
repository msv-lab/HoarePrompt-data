The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n - 1` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**
