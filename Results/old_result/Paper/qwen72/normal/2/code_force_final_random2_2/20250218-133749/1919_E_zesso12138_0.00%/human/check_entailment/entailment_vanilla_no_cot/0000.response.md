Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `i - n` (using an offset of `n` to handle negative indices).
   - The DP array is updated iteratively for each element in the array `a`, considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1.
   - The final result is obtained by looking up the value in the DP array corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the offset.

2. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and stores the results, printing them at the end.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that all operations are performed modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n = 1` and when the prefix sum array `p` is invalid (e.g., cannot be formed by any sequence of 1s and -1s).

Given these points, the program seems to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
