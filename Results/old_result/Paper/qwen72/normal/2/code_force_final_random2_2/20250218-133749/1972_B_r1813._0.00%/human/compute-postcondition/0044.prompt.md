You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually accept parameters to represent the input described in the problem. A corrected function definition would be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` was odd or even.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the final number of elements (either 'YES' or 'NO') equal to the number of strings in `data` after all iterations of the loop have completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
