The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `cases` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `info` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `j` is 1 (unchanged).
- `lex` is an input integer (unchanged).

The value of `arr` depends on the initial conditions:
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` was initially [1], and now it becomes [1, 26].
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` was initially [26], and now it becomes [26, 26].
- If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` was initially [26] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive), or an empty list if `lex` is greater than 52. After appending 26, `arr` becomes [26, 26] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive), or [26] if `lex` is greater than 52.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` is less than 28, [26, 26] if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or [26] if `lex` is greater than 52.**
