The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, making it now greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains integers provided by the user input, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
