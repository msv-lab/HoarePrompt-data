Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all the 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons. However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Grid Size Calculation**: The program assumes a grid size of 15 × 15, which is incorrect. Each screen is a 5 × 3 grid, so the total number of cells per screen is 15. This means the program should be working with a grid of 15 cells, not 15 × 15.

2. **Calculation of `t`**: The variable `t` is supposed to represent the number of screens required. The logic for calculating `t` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2 × 2 icons.

3. **Handling Remaining 1 × 1 Icons**: The logic for handling the remaining 1 × 1 icons (`t2`) is also incorrect. The program should correctly calculate how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1 × 1 icons.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
