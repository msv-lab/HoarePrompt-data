The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. This impacts the length of `preOne` and its final element.

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Identify the initial state:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - If `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
   - If `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
   - The variables `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` retain their initial values.

2. **Impact of the code:**
   - The last element of `preOne` is removed.
   - The length of `preOne` is reduced by 1.
   - The final element of `preOne` is no longer present.

3. **Calculate the result:**
   - The length of `preOne` is now `len(preOne) - 1`.
   - The final element of `preOne` before the operation is no longer part of the list.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, but the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` retain their initial values.**
