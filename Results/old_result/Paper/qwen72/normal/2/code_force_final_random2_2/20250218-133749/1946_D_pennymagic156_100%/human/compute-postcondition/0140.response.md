Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a list containing 0 for each element in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 0, `op` is the XOR of all bits at position 27 of the elements in the original `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 1, `t` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`.
- Initially, `a` was a non-empty list, and `t` was a list containing 0 for each element in `a` where the bit at position 27 is 0.
- After the swap, `a` now contains the values that were in `t`, which means `a` is a list containing 0 for each element in the original `a` where the bit at position 27 is 0.
- `t` is now an empty list, as it was assigned the value of an empty list `[]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
