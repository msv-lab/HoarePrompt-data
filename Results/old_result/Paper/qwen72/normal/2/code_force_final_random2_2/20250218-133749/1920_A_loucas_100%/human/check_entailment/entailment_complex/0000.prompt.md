Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []

            if x == 1:

            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)

            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

        print(num)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is the final calculated value based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints where `a` is 1, `less` for constraints where `a` is 2, and `no` for constraints where `a` is 3. It then calculates the number of valid solutions (`num`) that satisfy the conditions: `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting for any values in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. The function prints the number of valid solutions for each test case. If no valid solutions exist for a test case, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged.
