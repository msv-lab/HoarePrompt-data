Reasoning:  

The program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the product of elements in the list `b` but does not take the modulo `m` at each step. According to the problem statement, the product should be taken modulo `m` before appending it to the result list `ans`.

2. **Order of Operations**: The function appends the elements to `b` in the order specified by the commands in `s`, but it calculates the cumulative product in reverse order. This is incorrect because the problem requires the product to be calculated and printed immediately before each removal operation, not after all removals.

3. **Final Output**: The function returns the cumulative products in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires. The problem specifies that the output should be the remainders of the product of the current state of the array `a` before each command is executed.

To fix these issues, the function should calculate the product modulo `m` immediately before each removal and append the result to the output list. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product)
    return b
```

With this corrected function, the program will correctly compute and output the remainders of the product of the current state of the array `a` before each command is executed.

Correctness: **False**  
The original program does not correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement. The issues mentioned above need to be fixed for the program to be considered correct.
