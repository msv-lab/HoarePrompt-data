Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. Additionally, the current value of `r` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` was initially 1, `v1` now also becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
