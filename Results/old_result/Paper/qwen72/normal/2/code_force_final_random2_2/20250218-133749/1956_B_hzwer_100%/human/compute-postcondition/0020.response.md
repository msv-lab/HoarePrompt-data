To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements.
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element `cnt[i]` (where \(0 \leq i \leq n\)) represents how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

3. **Computing `ans`:**
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, we compute `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - This means if `x` is 0 or 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0.
   - If `x` is greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`.
   - We then sum these values to get `ans`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the computed value of `ans`.

Given the initial state and the computation, the output will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all elements x in cnt)**
