Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list with at least 7 elements:
   - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The next five elements are returned by the function `r()`.
   - The last element is `2000000000.0`.

2. `w` is the fourth element of `a`.
3. `x` is the fifth element of `a`.
4. `y` is the sixth element of `a`.
5. `z` is the seventh element of `a`.
6. `u` is `-1`.
7. `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`.
8. `v` is `y - x`.
9. `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`.
10. `t` is `False`.
11. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), r(), r(), r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - Let's denote the elements returned by `r()` as `r1, r2, r3, r4, r5`.

2. **Variables `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`**:
   - `w = a[3] = r3`
   - `x = a[4] = r4`
   - `y = a[5] = r5`
   - `z = a[6] = 2000000000.0`

3. **Variable `v`**:
   - `v = y - x = r5 - r4`

4. **List `b`**:
   - `b = [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`

5. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`.
   - Let's denote these values as `c` and `d`.

6. **Condition**:
   - If `c < d`, then `c < d` (which is always true).
   - If `c >= d`, then `c >= d` (which is always true).

7. **Index Calculation**:
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are used to access elements in `b`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are indices, they must be valid indices for the list `b`.

8. **Possible Values for `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are integers between 1 and 5 (since `b` has 10 elements and indices start from 0).

9. **Accessing Elements in `b`**:
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` will access the elements at the specified indices.

10. **Final Calculation**:
    - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will subtract the two accessed elements.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `c = 2` and `d = 3`.
- `c * 2 - 1 = 2 * 2 - 1 = 3`
- `d * 2 - 1 = 3 * 2 - 1 = 5`
- `b[3] = 1`
- `b[5] = 2`
- `b[3] - b[5] = 1 - 2 = -1`

### General Case:
- The exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, but they are valid indices for the list `b`.
- The result of the subtraction will depend on the specific values of `c` and `d`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `b` and the indices `c` and `d`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are indices returned by r() and b is the list [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v])**
