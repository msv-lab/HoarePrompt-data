Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is `x >> 27 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is `(val >> 27 & 1) ^ (val >> 27 & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is a list containing 0 and `ai`.**

Explanation:
- The code `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the list `t`.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is a list containing 0.
- After appending `ai` to `t`, the list `t` now contains 0 and `ai`.
- All other variables (`i`, `u`, `v`, `a`, `val`, `op`, `ai`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
