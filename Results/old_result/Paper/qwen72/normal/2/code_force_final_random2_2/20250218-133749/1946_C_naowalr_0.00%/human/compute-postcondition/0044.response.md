To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5.
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.
   - `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds.
   - `R` is `L + 1`.
   - `numCuts` is 0.

2. **Understanding `L`:**
   - `L` is defined as the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds.
   - This implies that `L` is determined based on the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `L` is defined based on the condition involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, and these values are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `L`.
   - However, we know that `L` is the largest integer satisfying the given condition.

Given the lack of specific values for `numCuts` and `leftover`, the best we can do is describe `L` in terms of the condition it satisfies.

Output: **L (where L is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds)**
