The code `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`

So, `i * curr` is `(n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and both are positive integers, the expression `n // (n - k + 1)` gives the largest integer less than or equal to the division of `n` by `n - k + 1`. 

Therefore, `n -= i * curr` simplifies to:
- `n -= (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`

Since `n // (n - k + 1)` is the integer part of the division of `n` by `n - k + 1`, multiplying it back by `n - k + 1` and subtracting from `n` leaves the remainder of the division of `n` by `n - k + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `n` is the remainder when `n` is divided by `n - k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**.
