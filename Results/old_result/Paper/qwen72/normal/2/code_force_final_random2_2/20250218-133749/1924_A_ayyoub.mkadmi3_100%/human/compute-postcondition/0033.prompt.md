You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet` at the time they were processed. `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, otherwise, `s2` remains an empty string. The set `alphabet` will be reset to its original state (containing the first k lowercase English alphabets) if the last character of `s` was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it; otherwise, `alphabet` will contain the remaining characters that were not removed during the loop's execution.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the value of `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring is a part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. The value of `s2` is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s`, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and a string `s2` which is either the last character of `s` or an empty string.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the value of `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring is a part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. The value of `s2` is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in `alphabet` when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
