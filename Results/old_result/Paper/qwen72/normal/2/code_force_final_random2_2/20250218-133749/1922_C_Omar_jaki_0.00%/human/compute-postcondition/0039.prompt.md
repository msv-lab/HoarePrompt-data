Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is the value returned by `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 1 and must evaluate to `True` - 1; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If `c` < `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 2 and must evaluate to `True` - 2; `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. If `c` < `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains the first integer read from the input minus 1, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `queries` remains a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `b` is a list where the first two elements are `[0, 0]`, and subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the conditions `(v > x - w)` and `(v > z - y)` applied to each triplet `(w, x, y, z)` in the list `a`. The length of `b` will be `len(a) - 2`; `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 3 and must evaluate to `True` - 3; `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. If `c` < `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
