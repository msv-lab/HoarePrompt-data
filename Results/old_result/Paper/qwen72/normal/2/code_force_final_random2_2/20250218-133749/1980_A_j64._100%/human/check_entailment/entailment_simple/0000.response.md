Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of problems and rounds, and the string representing the difficulties of the problems. The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and calculates how many additional problems are needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level for the specified number of rounds. The calculation of `needed_problems` is done by checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and, if so, adding the difference to `needed_problems`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
