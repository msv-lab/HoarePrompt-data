You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is 0, `i` is `num` (which is 0), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, `op` is the total number of operations performed across all iterations. If any `num2` was greater than 10000 during the iterations, the loop broke out early. Otherwise, for each valid `num2`, `a` was a list of integers extracted from the corresponding `case`, `b` was a sorted version of `a`, `ma` was set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` was even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` was odd, `median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` before the loop started, `new_median` was the element at index `ma` in `b` after the loop completed, and `b[ma]` was incremented until `new_median` became greater than `median`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
