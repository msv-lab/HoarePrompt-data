Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing four input strings, and the loop has executed 2 times.**

Explanation: The code appends a new input string to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contained three input strings. After executing the code, `a` now contains four input strings. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the loop has still executed 2 times.
