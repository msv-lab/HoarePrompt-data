Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged. `resultado` is `float('inf')`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k, n):
    resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
    soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - k`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A` plus `lista_B[n - k]`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `resultado` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A` plus `lista_B[n - k]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `resultado` is the minimum of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k]` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - k + 2]`, `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[n - k + 2]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
