Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is `t-1`, `n` is greater than 1 for each test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` for the last test case, `i` is `n-1` for the last test case, `v2` is `n-1` for the last test case, `r` is the final user input for the last test case, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' for the last test case. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The variable `kp` will be one less than `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all but the last iteration.
- For each test case, the variable `n` is still greater than 1, as it was when the loop started.
- The variable `g` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- The variables `v1`, `i`, and `v2` will be set to `n-1` for the last test case, reflecting the final values they take in the loop.
- The variable `r` will hold the final user input for the last test case.
- The variable `prev` will be the last index where the user input `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop for the last test case.
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called for each test case to ensure that all outputs are flushed to the terminal or file.
