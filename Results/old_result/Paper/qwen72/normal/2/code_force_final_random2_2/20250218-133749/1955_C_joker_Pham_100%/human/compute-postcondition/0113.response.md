Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `l` does not equal `r`; otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
