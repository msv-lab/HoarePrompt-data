Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`**. 

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` creates a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of the string `s`. The length of `s2` is the same as the length of `s`, and it contains the same characters but in a random order. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
