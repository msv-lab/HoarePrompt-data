The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 2, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
