To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
- `ap` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is 1.
- `bxsfory` is undefined.
- `bxsfory1` is undefined.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `y`**: The value of `y` is an integer read from input. Since the exact value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider the general behavior of the `math.ceil` function.
2. **`math.ceil(y / 2)`**: This expression calculates the ceiling of `y / 2`. The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

### Explanation:
- If `y` is even, `y / 2` will be an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return that integer.
- If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a float with a `.5` decimal part, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `y` is not provided, the output will depend on the value of `y` read from input. However, we can describe the output in terms of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is the integer value read from input)**

This means the output will be the ceiling of half of the integer `y`.
