Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `_` is 1.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of the original `s`.
- If the new `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition `s != s2` holds true.
- If the new `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition `s == s2` holds true.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
