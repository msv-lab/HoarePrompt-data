Output State: **After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be either '1', '0', or '-1', depending on the transformations applied during the loop. The `flag` is 1, indicating that a transformation is pending, and the last element of `s` (s[29]) is now '1'.**
