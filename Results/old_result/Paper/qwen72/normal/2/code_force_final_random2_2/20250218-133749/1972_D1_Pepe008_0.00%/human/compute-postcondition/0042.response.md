The code snippet provided reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `info`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `suma` directly, but it updates the value of `info`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
