### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Single Character String**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.

3. **All Characters Are the Same**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program prints 'No'. This is also correct because it is impossible to rearrange such a string to form a different string.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.

5. **Check for Equality**: After generating a random permutation `s2`, the program checks if `s2` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

6. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Case Sensitivity**: The problem statement specifies that "YES" and "NO" can be in any case. The program consistently outputs 'No' and 'Yes', which is acceptable according to the problem statement. Therefore, this is not a correctness issue but a minor formatting issue.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. The minor formatting issue does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Final: **True**
