The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the first element in `palka` and `d.get(i)` is not `None`, the value associated with `i` in the dictionary `d` is increased by 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`palka` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `d.get(i)` is not `None`, and `d[i]` is increased by 1.**
