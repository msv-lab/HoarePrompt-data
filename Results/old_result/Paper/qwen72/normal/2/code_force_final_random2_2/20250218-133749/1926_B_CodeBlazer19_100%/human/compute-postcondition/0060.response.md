Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If the count of '1' characters in any input string `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' characters in any input string `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` has more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. If no input string `s` has exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. Additionally, `a` is 0.**
