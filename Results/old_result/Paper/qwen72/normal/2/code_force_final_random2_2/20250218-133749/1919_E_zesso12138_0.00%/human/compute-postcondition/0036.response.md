The function `func_2` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: A positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array `a`.
- `p`: A list of `n` integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`.

Since the output is not specified in the provided snippet, I will assume that the function is expected to return some result based on the input parameters. However, without further details on the expected output, I can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`), and `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`).**
