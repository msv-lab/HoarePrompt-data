The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the end of the list `arr`. The value of `lex` depends on its initial value as specified in the initial state conditions. Let's evaluate the different cases:

1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is initially `[1, 1]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 2`.
2. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is initially `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`.
3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is initially `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`.
4. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is initially `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex - 52`.

After appending `lex` to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be:

1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
2. If `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
3. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
4. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is updated as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.**
