The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. 

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a result based on these parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer from the typical behavior of functions with similar parameters.

Given the constraints and the nature of the parameters, a common functionality might involve some form of comparison or computation between the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. It processes these parameters to return a result based on the elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` and the values of `n` and `k`. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it likely involves some form of comparison or computation between the elements of the lists.**
