The code snippet constructs a string `result` by joining the `char` elements from the `details` list, which contains tuples in the form `(0, -i, char)`. Each `char` in `details` corresponds to a character in the original string `s`, and since `details` is sorted in the order the characters appear in `s`, `result` will be a string that is identical to `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`. `char` is the last character of `s`. `balance` is 0. `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, sorted in the order they appear in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(0, -i, char)`. `result` is a string equal to `s`.**
