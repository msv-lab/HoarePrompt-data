Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from the original `right` position or the length of `s` if no '0' is found, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.** 

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `right` will either point to the first '0' in the list `s` starting from its initial position, or it will be equal to the length of `s` if no '0' is found. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `i`, and `left`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
