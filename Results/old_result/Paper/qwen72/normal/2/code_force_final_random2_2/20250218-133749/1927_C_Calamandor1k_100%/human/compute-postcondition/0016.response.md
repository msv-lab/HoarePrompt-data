Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, the first tuple in `cases` is `(n, m, k, a, b)` where `n` and `m` are integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and `b` is a list of integers of length `m` (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6). `results` is a list, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common to both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next line of code.***
