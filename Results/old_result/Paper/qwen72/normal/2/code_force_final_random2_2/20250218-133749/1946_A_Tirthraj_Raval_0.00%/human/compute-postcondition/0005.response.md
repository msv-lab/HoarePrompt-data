The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains the same elements but in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**
