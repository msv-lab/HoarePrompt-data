Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement a dynamic programming solution to count the number of possible initial arrays \(a\) that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\). Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program seems to be correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases \(t\) and the details of each test case (the size of the array \(n\) and the sorted prefix sums \(p\)).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with a size of \(2n + 1\) to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from \(-n\) to \(n\). The `offset` variable is set to \(n\) to handle negative indices by shifting them to non-negative indices.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition is performed in a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n\). For each step \(i\), a new DP array `new_dp` is created to store the updated values. The transitions are based on the current state of `dp`:
     - If the current prefix sum is \(j\), the next possible prefix sums are \(j + 1\) (if adding 1 to the array) and \(j - 1\) (if adding -1 to the array).
     - These transitions are accumulated in `new_dp` and taken modulo \(998244353\) to ensure the values stay within the required range.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop completes, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`. This is the index in the `dp` array that corresponds to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
   - The value at this index in `dp` is returned as the result.

5. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` collects the results for all test cases and prints them one by one.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the dynamic programming approach, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
