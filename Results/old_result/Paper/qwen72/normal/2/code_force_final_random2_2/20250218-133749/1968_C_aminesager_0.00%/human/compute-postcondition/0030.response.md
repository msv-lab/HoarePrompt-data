The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, `result`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `line` is a new string input by the user
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`
- `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T[:n-1])]
- `i` is `n-1`
- `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now reversed, so the new `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]
- All other variables remain the same

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
