Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `x` is 0, `i` is 0. If the second character of the first string in `a` is '1' and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of the first string in `a` and the remaining characters starting from index `i` of the second string in `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list.***
