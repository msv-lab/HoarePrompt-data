You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` will contain all indices for which the user input was "=" or "<", `mak` will be the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", `mak2` will be the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, and `s` will be the last user input string. The output buffer will have been flushed multiple times during the loop execution, and the output buffer will be flushed again.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an environment with a hidden permutation of integers and finds two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is maximized, using at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
