Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, the length of `nums` is 21, and the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values. If `nums[0]` (which is 1) is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
