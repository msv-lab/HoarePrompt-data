Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, but the program continues to the next line of code.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop context is provided, the impact is that the program simply moves to the next line of code without changing any of the variables. All the conditions and values specified in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
