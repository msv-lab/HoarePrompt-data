To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `num` and `a`.

### Analysis:
- The loop `for num in a:` will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `a` contains at least one element.
- Since `a` has been fully iterated over, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
