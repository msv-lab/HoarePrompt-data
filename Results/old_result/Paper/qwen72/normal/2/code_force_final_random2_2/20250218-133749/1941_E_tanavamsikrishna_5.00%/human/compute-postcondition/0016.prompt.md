You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer, and `i` is `d-2`.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is `len(row) - 1`, `len(row)` is greater than or equal to `d`, and each element from index `d-1` to `len(row)-1` in `row` has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`, where `i` is `len(row) - 1`. This means the last element is the minimum value from the sublist starting from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`, added to the current value of the last element of `row`, plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d`. It updates the last element of `row` to be the minimum value from a specified sublist plus the current value of the last element plus 1, and returns this updated value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`, where `i` is `len(row) - 1`. This means the last element is the minimum value from the sublist starting from the maximum of 0 or `i - (d + 1)` up to `i`, added to the current value of the last element of `row`, plus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
