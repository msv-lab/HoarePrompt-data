Output State: **`t` is 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times, where `t` was initially an integer value between 1 and 10^4.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has run the exact number of times specified by the initial value of `t`. The function `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the initial value of `t`, which was an integer between 1 and 10^4.
