Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is not scalable and does not handle all possible values of \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The solution only explicitly handles \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) and prints a hardcoded pattern for these specific values. For any other value of \( n \), it prints "No esta en el rango" which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

A correct solution should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \) within the range. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for _ in range(casos):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2 * n):
            row = ''
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // 2 + j // 2) % 2 == 0:
                    row += '#'
                else:
                    row += '.'
            print(row)
```

This function correctly generates the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range. It uses nested loops to construct each row of the checkerboard, ensuring that the pattern alternates correctly.
