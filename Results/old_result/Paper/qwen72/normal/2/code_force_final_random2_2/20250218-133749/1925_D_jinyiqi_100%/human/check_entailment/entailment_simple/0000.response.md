### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` by iterating over the `m` pairs of friends.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The formula used is \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator is \( q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \).

5. **GCD and Simplification**: The program simplifies the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse**: The program computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using the `pow` function with the third argument as the modulus.

7. **Final Output**: The program prints the result of \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The mathematical formulas used are consistent with the problem statement.
- The use of GCD and modular inverse ensures that the result is in the required form.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
