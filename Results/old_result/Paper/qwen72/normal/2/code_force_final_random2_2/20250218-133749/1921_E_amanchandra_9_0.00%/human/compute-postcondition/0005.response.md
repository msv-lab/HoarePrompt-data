Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to `(xb - xa) // 2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divided by 2 using integer division. Since `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, the absolute difference is simply `xb - xa`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
