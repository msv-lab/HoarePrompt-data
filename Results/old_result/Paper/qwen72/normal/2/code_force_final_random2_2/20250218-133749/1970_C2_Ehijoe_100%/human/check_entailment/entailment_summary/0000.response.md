### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with \( n \) nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered active.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine the winner for each round, assuming optimal play.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent=None)`**:
     - This function checks if there is a path from the `start` node to any other node in the tree that avoids the `parent` node.
     - It returns `True` if such a path exists, indicating that the current player (starting from `start`) has a valid move.
     - It returns `False` if no such path exists, indicating that the current player is stuck and will lose the round.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies the starting node, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
     - It prints 'Ron' if `func_1` returns `True` (indicating Ron has a valid move and can win).
     - It prints 'Hermione' if `func_1` returns `False` (indicating Hermione wins because Ron cannot make a move).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly determines if there is a valid move from the starting node.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly constructs the tree and identifies the starting node.
   - The decision to print 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the result of `func_1` is correct.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and determine the winner for each round.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
