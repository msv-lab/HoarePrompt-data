The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= n <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if all characters in `s` are the same. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest permutation of `s`, depending on whether `s` is already in ascending order. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state reflects the number of test cases processed and the output printed for each case.
