Output State: **`ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of the elements `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a string with the space-separated string representations of the elements of the list `a` from `a[bets-1]` down to `a[0]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo`) will retain their values as described in the initial state, with the exception of `i`, which will be `bets - 1` (the final value of `i` after the loop completes).
