Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `len(set(s)) == 1` and `len(s) > 1`, then `s2` remains unchanged from `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by shifting the characters of `s` one position to the left, with the first character moved to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains as a shuffled version of `s`.***
