To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2.
   - `k` must be a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
   - `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, `l` will be a value that is one more than the result of `func_2()`, and it must not be equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `l` and `i * v`.

4. **Value of `i * v`:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can represent it as `v`.

5. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, let's denote `func_2()` as `m` where `m < n`.
   - Therefore, `l` is `m + 1`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `? {l} {i * v}`.
   - Substituting the known values, we get `? {m + 1} {2 * v}`.

Since `m` and `v` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe them in terms of their conditions.

Output: **? {m + 1} {2 * v} (where m is the result of func_2() and m < n, and v is an undefined variable)**
