Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an integer read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, `bxsfory1` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `ap`, `k`, `bxsfory`) remain unchanged.
- `bxsfory1` remains undefined.
