Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` must contain at least 3 elements, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, plus the first element of `l` (appended once), and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once), `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - 2` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the first element of `l` appended once, and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. No changes are made to the values of the variables, but the control flow of the program is altered. All the conditions and values mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
