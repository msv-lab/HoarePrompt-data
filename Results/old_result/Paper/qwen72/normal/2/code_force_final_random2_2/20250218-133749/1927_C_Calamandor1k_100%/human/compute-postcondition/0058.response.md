Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside the loop.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, or to the next line of code outside the loop if the loop is about to end.
- Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, all variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `total_distinct`) retain their original values.
- The condition `if len(only_b) > k // 2` is not evaluated here because the `continue` statement is executed unconditionally, causing the program to proceed to the next iteration or the next line of code without further checks or modifications.
