Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t * 2`, and since `t` was initially `t % MOD`, the new value of `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `i` is still 1, `k` is still greater than or equal to 2, and `ans` is still `ans % MOD`.
