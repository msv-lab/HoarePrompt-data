Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 3` with `y + 3` being less than `n`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` otherwise.***
