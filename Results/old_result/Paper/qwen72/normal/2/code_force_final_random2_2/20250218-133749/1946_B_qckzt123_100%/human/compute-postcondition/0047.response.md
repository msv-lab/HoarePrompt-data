Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` and `k` are the input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-2) * t) % MOD` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `k-2`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is reset to 0.
- `tmp` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `ans`, `i`) retain their previous values or expressions.
