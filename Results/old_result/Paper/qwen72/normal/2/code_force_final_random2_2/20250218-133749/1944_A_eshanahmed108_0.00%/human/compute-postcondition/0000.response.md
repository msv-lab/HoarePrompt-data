To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `t` is not directly used in the loop head, but it represents the number of test cases, which implies that `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- Since `t` is a positive integer and represents the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be set to `t`.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is set to `t`, which is a positive integer.
- The variables `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `int(input())` is `t`**
