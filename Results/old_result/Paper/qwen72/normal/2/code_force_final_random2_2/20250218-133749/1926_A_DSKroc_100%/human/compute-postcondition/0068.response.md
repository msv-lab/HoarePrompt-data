Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a new string input by the user, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. Additionally, the number of 'A' characters in `s` (`ac`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters in `s` (`bc`).**
