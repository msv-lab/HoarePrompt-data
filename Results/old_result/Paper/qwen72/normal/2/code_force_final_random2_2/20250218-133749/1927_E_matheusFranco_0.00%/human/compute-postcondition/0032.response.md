Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 4`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2 * k`, `permutation[1]` is `n // k + 1`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `n // k + 2`, `permutation[1 + 2 * k]` is `n // k + 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr_v` was initially `n // k + 3`.
- The code `curr_v += 1` increments `curr_v` by 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `curr_v` is `n // k + 4`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
