Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the game problem where Alice and Bob move their chips on a checkered board according to specific rules. The program reads the input for each test case, processes the coordinates and board dimensions, and determines the outcome of the game. The logic within `func_1` is complex and involves several conditional checks to determine whether Alice or Bob wins, or if the game ends in a draw.

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if Bob's chip is already in a position that is not below Alice's chip (`if x2 <= x1`). If so, it prints 'draw' because Bob cannot move up to Alice's position.
2. **Odd and Even Distance Handling**: The program then differentiates between cases where the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's chips is odd or even. This is crucial because the parity of the distance affects the possible moves and outcomes.
   - **Odd Distance**: If the distance is odd, the program checks if Alice can win by moving her chip to the same column as Bob's chip. If Alice can achieve this, she wins. Otherwise, the program performs additional checks to see if Alice can force a win by manipulating the positions.
   - **Even Distance**: If the distance is even, the program checks if Bob can win by moving his chip to the same column as Alice's chip. If Bob can achieve this, he wins. Otherwise, the program performs similar checks to see if Bob can force a win by manipulating the positions.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program also ensures that the chips do not move outside the board boundaries during the calculations.

Given the complexity of the game rules and the detailed checks in the program, the logic appears to correctly implement the game's rules and conditions. The program's structure and the sequence of checks align with the problem's requirements.

However, without running the program and verifying the output against the provided test cases, there is a small risk of missing edge cases or logical errors. Based on the provided execution summary and the structure of the code, the program seems to be correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
