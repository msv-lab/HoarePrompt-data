The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `char` is '+', `count` is 2; otherwise, `count` is 1. After incrementing, if `char` is '+', `count` becomes 3; otherwise, `count` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters with a length of at least 3, `char` is the third character of `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `length` equals the length of `expression`. If `char` is '+', `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**
