Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. `s` is not equal to 'mapie', does not contain the substring 'map', and may or may not contain the substring 'p'. `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`.
- Each iteration removes one occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.
- After all iterations, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map'.
- The value of `ans` will be the total number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.
- The string `s` will still consist of lowercase Latin letters and its length will still satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
- The string `s` will not be equal to 'mapie' and may or may not contain the substring 'p', depending on the initial string and the positions of 'map' substrings that were removed.
