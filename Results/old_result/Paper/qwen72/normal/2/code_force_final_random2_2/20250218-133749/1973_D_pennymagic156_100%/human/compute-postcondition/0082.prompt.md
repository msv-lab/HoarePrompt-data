Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be 0 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1, and the loop condition is `i > 0`). The value of `v` will be the last return value of `func_2()` unless `v` was set to `n` during one of the iterations, in which case `v` will be the value of `i` at that iteration. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    cnt, l = k, 1
    while cnt and l < n + 1:
        print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
        l = func_2() + 1
        cnt -= 1
    if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
        print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
        func_2()
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`). Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. Additionally, `cnt` is 0 and `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
