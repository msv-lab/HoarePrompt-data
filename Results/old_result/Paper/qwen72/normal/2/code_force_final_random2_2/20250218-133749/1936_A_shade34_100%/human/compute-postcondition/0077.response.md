Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=".
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with a question mark (`?`).
   - It will then print the value of `mak` twice, which is 0.
   - It will then print the value of `i` twice.

4. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `len(pans) - 1`.
   - `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=".
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, there must be at least one value in `pans` (because `n > 1` implies there are at least two elements to compare).
   - Therefore, `len(pans)` is at least 1, making `i` at least 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `? 0 0 i i`, where `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.

Output: **? 0 0 [i] [i] (where [i] is len(pans) - 1)**
