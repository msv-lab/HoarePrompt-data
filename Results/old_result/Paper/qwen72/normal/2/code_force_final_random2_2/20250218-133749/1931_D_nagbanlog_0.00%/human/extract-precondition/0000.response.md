Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
