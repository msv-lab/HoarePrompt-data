Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k-1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the program continues with the current values. If `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.***
