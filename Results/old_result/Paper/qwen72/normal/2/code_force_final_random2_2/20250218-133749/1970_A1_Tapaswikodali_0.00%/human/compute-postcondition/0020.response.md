Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The variable `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`. The variable `char` is the last character of `s`. The variable `balance` is 0 because the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. The variable `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(balance, -i, char)` representing the balance at that point, the negative index, and the character itself.**
