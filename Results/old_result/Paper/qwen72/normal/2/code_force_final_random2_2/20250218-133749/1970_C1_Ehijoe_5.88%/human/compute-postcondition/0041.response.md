The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, but specifically, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, `empty` is True or False (unchanged), and `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, and if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If none of these conditions are met, `tree` remains unchanged.**
