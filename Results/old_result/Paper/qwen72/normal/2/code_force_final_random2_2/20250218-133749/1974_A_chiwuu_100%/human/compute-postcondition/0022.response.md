Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine the final value of `t` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.

### Step-by-Step Logic:
1. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`

2. **Update `t` based on its parity:**
   - If `t` is even, set `t` to `b // 2`.
   - If `t` is odd, set `t` to `(t // 2) + 1`.

3. **Check the value of `t1` relative to `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made.
   - If `t1 < a`, calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.

4. **Update `t` based on `t2`:**
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, set `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
   - Otherwise, set `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Final Value of `t`:
To determine the final value of `t`, we need to consider the sequence of operations:

1. **Initial `t1` Calculation:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`

2. **Update `t` based on parity:**
   - If `t` is even: `t = b // 2`
   - If `t` is odd: `t = (t // 2) + 1`

3. **Check `t1` against `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, calculate `t2`:
     - `t2 = a - t1`
   - Update `t`:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t = t + t2 // 15`
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the process:
- `t = 7` (odd)
- `b = 10`
- `a = 50`

1. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = 7 * 15 - 10 * 4 = 105 - 40 = 65`

2. **Update `t` based on parity:**
   - Since `t` is odd: `t = (7 // 2) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`

3. **Check `t1` against `a`:**
   - `t1 = 65` and `a = 50`
   - Since `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made.

4. **Final value of `t`:**
   - `t = 4`

### General Case:
Without specific values for `t`, `a`, and `b`, we can describe the final value of `t` in terms of the given conditions and operations.

### Output:
Output: **t (where t is the final value after the described operations based on the initial values of t, a, and b)**
