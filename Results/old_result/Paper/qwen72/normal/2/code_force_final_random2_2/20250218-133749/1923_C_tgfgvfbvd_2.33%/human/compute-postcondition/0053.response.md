The code `p.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the end of the list `p`. Since `c` is the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, and `p` initially contains only the first element of `l`, after executing this code, `p` will contain two elements: the first element of `l` and the sum of the first and second elements of `l`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l` and the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, `c` is the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the second element in `l`.**
