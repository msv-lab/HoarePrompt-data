Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains the first integer from the input, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the maximum quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), it checks two conditions:
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `isqrt(x) + 1`, and `ans` will hold the maximum value found according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
