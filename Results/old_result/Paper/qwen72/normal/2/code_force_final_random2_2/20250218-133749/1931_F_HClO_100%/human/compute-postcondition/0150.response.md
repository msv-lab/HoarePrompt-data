Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `_` is `m - 1`, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 1` times, `m - 1` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `_` is updated to `m - 2`, `m` remains greater than 2, and the program waits for user input, skipping the current iteration of the loop. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**
