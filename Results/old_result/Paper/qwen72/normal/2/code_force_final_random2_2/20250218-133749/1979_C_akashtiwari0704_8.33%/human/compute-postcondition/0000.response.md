The value of `t` is assigned the integer value obtained from the user input. The other variables (`n`, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n`) remain unchanged and their preconditions are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**
