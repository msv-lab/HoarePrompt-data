The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
