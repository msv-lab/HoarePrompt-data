Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the last user input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mak` is 0 or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mak` is 0 or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mak` is either 0 or `n-1` based on the last user input. If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution. `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
