The value of `ans` is updated to be `ans % MOD`. Since `t` was already `t % MOD` and `ans` was increased by `t % MOD`, the new value of `ans` is effectively the remainder when the current `ans` is divided by `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`.**
