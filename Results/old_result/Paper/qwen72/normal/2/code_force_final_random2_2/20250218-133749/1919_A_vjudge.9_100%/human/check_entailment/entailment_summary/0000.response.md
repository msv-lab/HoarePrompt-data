Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This is because the game involves alternating moves and removing one coin per turn, which means the game will end when one player cannot make a move. If the initial difference in the number of coins is even, the game will end in a position where the player whose turn it is (starting with Alice) will be forced to lose, assuming optimal play. Conversely, if the difference is odd, the player starting the game (Alice) will have a winning strategy.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`). If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
