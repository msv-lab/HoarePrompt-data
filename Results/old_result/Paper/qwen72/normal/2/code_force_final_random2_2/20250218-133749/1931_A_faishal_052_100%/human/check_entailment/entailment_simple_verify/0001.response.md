### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - Letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the letters should equal `n`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.
   - It then iterates over the range 2 (for the first two letters) and checks the value of `lex` (the remaining sum):
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the indices are in ascending order, which helps in finding the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Finally, it converts the indices to characters and prints the resulting word.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `lex` is less than 28, between 28 and 52, and between 52 and 78.
   - The sorting step ensures that the smallest possible combination of letters is used.
   - However, the logic for appending 1 or 26 to `arr` is not optimal. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will append 1 twice and then 25, which is not the lexicographically smallest combination.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for appending 1 or 26 to `arr` is not optimal. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will append 1 twice and then 25, which is not the lexicographically smallest combination.
   - A better approach would be to always try to use the smallest possible values first and adjust the remaining sum accordingly.

5. **Corrected Approach:**
   - Instead of using fixed values like 1 and 26, we should try to use the smallest possible values first and adjust the remaining sum.
   - For example, if `lex` is 27, we should use 'a' (1), 'a' (1), and 'y' (25) to get the lexicographically smallest word "aay".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word due to the fixed values used in the conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
