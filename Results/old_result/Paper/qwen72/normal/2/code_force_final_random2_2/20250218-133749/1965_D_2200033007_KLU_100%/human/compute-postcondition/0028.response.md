The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, where `n` is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The function returns the list `a` which is populated based on the conditions described. Each element in `a` is either set to a value from the `odds` list or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The exact values in `a` depend on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `idx` is `0`, and if `n` is odd, `idx` is `-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `a` where each element is either a value from `odds` or calculated based on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`.**
