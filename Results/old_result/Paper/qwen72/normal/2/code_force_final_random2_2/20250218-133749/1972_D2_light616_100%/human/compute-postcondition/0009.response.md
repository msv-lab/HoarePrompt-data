Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same integer that was input by the user, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. **
