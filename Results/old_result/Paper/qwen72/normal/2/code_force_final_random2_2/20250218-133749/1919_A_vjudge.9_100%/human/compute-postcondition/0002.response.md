Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using a space as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
