Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
