To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant details:

1. **`l`**: This is a list that contains all its original elements.
2. **`ans2`**: This list contains all elements from `l` appended once. This means `ans2` is a copy of `l`.

Given this information, the `print(*ans2)` statement will print all elements of `ans2` separated by spaces. Since `ans2` is a copy of `l`, it will print all elements of `l` separated by spaces.

Let's summarize the output:

- `l` contains all its original elements.
- `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended once, so `ans2` is a copy of `l`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(*ans2)` statement will be the elements of `l` separated by spaces.

Output: **elements of l separated by spaces**
