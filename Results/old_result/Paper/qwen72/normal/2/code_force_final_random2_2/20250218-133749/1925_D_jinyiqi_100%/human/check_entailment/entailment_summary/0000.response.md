Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Friendship Values**: Each friend pair starts with an initial friendship value.
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: If a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values after k excursions needs to be calculated.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` of the expected value fraction.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \).

5. **Simplification and Modular Inverse**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor.
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of `q` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:

- The program follows the correct logic for calculating the expected value.
- The use of the combination formula and the expected value formula aligns with the problem statement.
- The simplification and modular inverse steps are correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
