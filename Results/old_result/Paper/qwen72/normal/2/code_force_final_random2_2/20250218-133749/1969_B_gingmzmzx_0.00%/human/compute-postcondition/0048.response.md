Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the original `s`.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in `s`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
   - `cnt[0]` is the same as `zeroes`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the count of 1s in the list `s`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `zeroes * cnt[1]`, which is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans`.

Given the above, the value of `ans` is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`.

Output: **zeroes * cnt[1] (where zeroes is the number of 0s in the list s and cnt[1] is the number of 1s in the list s)**
