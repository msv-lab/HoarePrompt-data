The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`. The variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1**
