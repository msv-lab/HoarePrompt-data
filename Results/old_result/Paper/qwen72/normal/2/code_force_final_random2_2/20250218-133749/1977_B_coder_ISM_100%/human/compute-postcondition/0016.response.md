The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. This changes the length of `s` from 2 to 3, and the new third element is `'1'`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing three elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is set (i.e., 1), then `s` is either `['1', '1', '1']` or `['0', '1', '1']`. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), then `s` is either `['1', '0', '1']` or `['0', '0', '1']`.**
