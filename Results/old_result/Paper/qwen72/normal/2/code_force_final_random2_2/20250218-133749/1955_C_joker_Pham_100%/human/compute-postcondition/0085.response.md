Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2. If `a[l]` is 0, `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` was 0 before the execution, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `a[l]` is not 0, `k` and `a[l]` remain unchanged, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
