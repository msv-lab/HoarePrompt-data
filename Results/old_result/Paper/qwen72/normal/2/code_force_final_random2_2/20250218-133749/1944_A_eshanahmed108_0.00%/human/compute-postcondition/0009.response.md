To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- The loop will execute one more time if there are iterations remaining as specified by the initial `int(input())` value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Evaluation**: The `print` statement contains a conditional expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`.
   - This means that if the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, the value of `n` will be printed.
   - If the condition `n - k <= 1` is false, the value `1` will be printed.

2. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `n - k <= 1` can be rewritten as `n <= k + 1`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, then `n` will be printed.
   - If `n` is greater than `k + 1`, then `1` will be printed.

### Final Output:
- If `n <= k + 1`, the output will be `n`.
- If `n > k + 1`, the output will be `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **n if n <= k + 1 else 1 (where n is the first input integer and k is the second input integer)**
