The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numero_testes`. For the loop to execute, `numero_testes` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)**
