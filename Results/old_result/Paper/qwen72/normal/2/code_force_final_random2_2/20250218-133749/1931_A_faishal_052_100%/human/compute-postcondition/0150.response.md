Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `range` is 3.

2. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is constructed from the first three elements of `info[1]` (which is the second element of the `info` list).
   - Each element in `info[1]` is added to 96 to get the ASCII value of a character.
   - For example, if `info[1] = [1, 2, 3]`, then:
     - `info[1][0] + 96` is `1 + 96` which is 97, and the character corresponding to ASCII value 97 is 'a'.
     - `info[1][1] + 96` is `2 + 96` which is 98, and the character corresponding to ASCII value 98 is 'b'.
     - `info[1][2] + 96` is `3 + 96` which is 99, and the character corresponding to ASCII value 99 is 'c'.
   - Therefore, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(temp)` will print the string `temp`.

Given the initial state and the construction of `temp`, the output will be:

Output: **'abc' (where 'abc' is the string constructed from the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`)**
