The code snippet `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Based on the initial state, there are two possible scenarios for the value of `temp`:

1. If `temp` is 2 (because `temp * 2` is less than `k`), then after executing `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes 4.
2. If `temp` is 1 (because `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`), then after executing `temp *= 2`, `temp` becomes 2.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1 if `temp` was 2, otherwise `i` is 0, `temp` is 4 if it was 2, otherwise `temp` is 2.**
