The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function operates under the constraint that `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The specific behavior or return value of the function based on these inputs is not provided, so I cannot accurately describe the output without additional information.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature and the missing output description, I can only infer that the function likely processes some form of input related to `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns a result based on these values. Without further details, I cannot specify the exact functionality.
