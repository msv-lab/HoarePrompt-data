Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `s[0]` is '-1' and `s[0]` was previously '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1', `s[1]` is '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'. If the condition `s[0] == '-1'` and `s[-1] == '1'` is not met, the list `s` remains unchanged.***
