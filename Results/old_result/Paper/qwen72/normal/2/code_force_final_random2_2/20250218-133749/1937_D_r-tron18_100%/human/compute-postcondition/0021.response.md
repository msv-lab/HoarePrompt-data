The value of `totalOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, but the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` retain their initial values.**
