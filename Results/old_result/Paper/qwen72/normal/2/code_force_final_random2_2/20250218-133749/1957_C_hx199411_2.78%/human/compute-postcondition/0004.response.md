Output State: **t is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5. `num` is 0.**
