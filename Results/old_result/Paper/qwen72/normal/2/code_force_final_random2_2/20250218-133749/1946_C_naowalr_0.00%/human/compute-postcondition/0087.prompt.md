Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 100001, and `numCuts` is now 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than 50001 if `numCuts` is equal to `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is `x`. If none of these conditions are met, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
