Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `s` was a string input by the user. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` was 1, the program printed 'NO'. If the length of `a` was greater than 1, the program printed 'YES', and then it printed either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or in descending order, depending on whether `s` was already sorted in ascending order.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range (1 to 1000).
- The variable `n` indicates the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- The variable `i` is one less than `n` (i.e., `i = n - 1`), reflecting the last index of the loop.
- For each iteration, the program processed a string `s` input by the user, checked if it contained unique characters, and printed the appropriate output based on the conditions described.
