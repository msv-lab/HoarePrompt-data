### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Equality (`n == k`)**:
   - If `n` (the number of coins Alice has) is equal to `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy), the solution is straightforward. Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles this simple case correctly.

2. **Check for Insufficient Coins (`n < k`)**:
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins.
   - This part of the code correctly identifies and handles this case by printing "NO".

3. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - The code attempts to set up two stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The first stall is set up with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. This ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall, leaving her with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
   - The second stall is set up with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will use the remaining `k - 1` coins to buy `k - 1` more jewels, totaling `k` jewels.
   - This approach is correct and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The code prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices of the stalls.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls with the correct prices.

### Correctness:
