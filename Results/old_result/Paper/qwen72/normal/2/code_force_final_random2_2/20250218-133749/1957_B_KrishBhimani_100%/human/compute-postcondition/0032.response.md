The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length reaches `n`. The number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `n` is not equal to 1
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `ans` is a list containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\)
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\)
- `temp` is \(2^i\)

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Length of `ans`**: The initial length of `ans` is 2 because it contains two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).
2. **Number of zeros to append**: The number of zeros to append is `n - len(ans)`, which is `n - 2`.
3. **Updated `ans`**: After appending `n - 2` zeros, the new length of `ans` will be `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `n` is not equal to 1
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\)
- `temp` is \(2^i\)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), `temp` is \(2^i\)**.
