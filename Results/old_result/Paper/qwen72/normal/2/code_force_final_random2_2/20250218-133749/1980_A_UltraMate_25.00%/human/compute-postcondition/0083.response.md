Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`.***
