Output State: **`t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 2.** 

Explanation:
- `t` was initially `t % MOD`. After executing `t *= 2`, `t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`.
- `ans` was initially `((s + t * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Since `t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `ans` is updated to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2 * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- All other variables (`tmp`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
