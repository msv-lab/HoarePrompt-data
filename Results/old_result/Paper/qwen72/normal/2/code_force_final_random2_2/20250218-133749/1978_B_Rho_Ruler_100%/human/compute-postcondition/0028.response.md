Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. The variable `low` is greater than `high`, indicating that the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the last calculated midpoint before the loop terminated. The variable `profit_mid` holds the profit value at the last midpoint `mid`. The variable `profit_next` holds the profit value at `mid + 1`. The variable `max_profit` holds the maximum profit value encountered during all iterations of the loop.**

This means that after the loop has completed, the binary search process has narrowed down the range `[low, high]` until `low` is no longer less than or equal to `high`, and `max_profit` contains the highest profit value found within the range. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
