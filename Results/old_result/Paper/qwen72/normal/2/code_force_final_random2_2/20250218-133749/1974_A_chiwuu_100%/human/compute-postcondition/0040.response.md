Initial State: `a` is an integer, `t` is initially equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is equal to `b // 2 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

Code:
```
a, b = input().split()
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The input is split into two parts, which are assigned to `a` and `b`.
2. `a` and `b` are now strings representing the input values.
3. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t`, and `t1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings representing the input values, `t` is initially equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, otherwise `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
