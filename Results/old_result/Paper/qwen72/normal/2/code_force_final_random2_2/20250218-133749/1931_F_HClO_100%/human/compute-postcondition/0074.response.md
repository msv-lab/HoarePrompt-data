Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the loop breaks. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is the value it had before the last iteration, `p1` is 1, `p2` is the value it had before the last iteration. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is the value it had before the last iteration, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is the value it had before the last iteration, `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `p1` and `p2` also remain as they were before the last iteration. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the loop breaks.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n - 2`.
- The final value of `i` is `n - 2`.
- The conditions inside the loop check if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If they are not equal, further checks are made to update `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `n - 2`, and the loop breaks.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, `idx1` is set to `n - 2`, and `p1` is set to 1.
- If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, and `p2` is set to 1.
- If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.
- If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
