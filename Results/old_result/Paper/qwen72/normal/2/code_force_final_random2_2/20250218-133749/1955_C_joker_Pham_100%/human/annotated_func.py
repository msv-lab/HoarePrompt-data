    #State: The loop will terminate with `l` being greater than `r` or `k` being 0. The variable `sunks` will contain the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. The values of `a` will be modified according to the operations performed within the loop, potentially reducing some elements to 0 or altering their values based on the conditions checked. The values of `n` and `k` will remain unchanged from their initial values, except for `k` which may be reduced as per the operations inside the loop.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total count of elements from the list `a` that have been fully processed (either removed or their values reduced to 0) during the loop's execution. This count is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the list `a`), `k` (a positive integer), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers). It processes the list `a` by repeatedly reducing the values of its elements based on the available value of `k`. The function terminates when either the entire list has been processed or `k` is exhausted. The final state of the program is such that the list `a` may have some of its elements reduced to 0 or altered, and the function returns the total count of elements that have been fully processed (reduced to 0 or removed). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, except for `k` which may be reduced as a result of the operations performed.
