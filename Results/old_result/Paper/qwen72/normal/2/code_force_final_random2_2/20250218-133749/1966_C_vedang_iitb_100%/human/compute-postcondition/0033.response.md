The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the first element of the list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The next value of `sz` will be the second element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element of the list `a`. If `sz` (the second element of the list `a`) is 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
