The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `bets`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `bets` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is now equal to `a[0] * a[1]`, `i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 2**
