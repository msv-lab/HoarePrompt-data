The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints, it implicitly accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
  - `p`: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.

The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not detailed in the provided information. Given the context, it is likely that the function returns some form of processed data or results based on the permutations and the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
