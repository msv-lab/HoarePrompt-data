The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result indicates whether the cards can be distributed such that no two players receive the same card number more than once.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the cards can be distributed such that no two players receive the same card number more than once for each test case.**
