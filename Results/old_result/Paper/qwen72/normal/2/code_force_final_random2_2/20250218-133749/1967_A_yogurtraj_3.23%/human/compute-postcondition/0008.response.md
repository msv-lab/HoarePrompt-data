Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**
