Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values. Additionally, `combined` is not empty.**
