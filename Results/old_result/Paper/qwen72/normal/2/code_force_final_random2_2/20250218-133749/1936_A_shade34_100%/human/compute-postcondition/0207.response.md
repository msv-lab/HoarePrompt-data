Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `pans` must have at least 3 elements.
- `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the current user input is '>' or not.
- `s` is the last user input string.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**: 
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1.
   - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.

2. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.

3. **Print Statement Breakdown**:
   - The first element printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The next two elements printed are `pans[mak]` repeated twice.
   - The last two elements printed are `pans[2]` repeated twice.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `mak` is 0:
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.
- If `mak` is 1:
  - The print statement will be: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these elements.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[2] pans[2] (where mak is 0 or 1, and pans[0], pans[1], and pans[2] are the first, second, and third elements of the pans list respectively)**
