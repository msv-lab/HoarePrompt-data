The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'##'`. The initial state provides information about variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `c` is set to 2.
- `casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'##'`.

Output: **##**
