Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration), `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the new input string, `mak` remains as described based on the conditions of `s`. If `s` is '=', `pans` now includes the value of `i` appended to it. The output buffer has been flushed.***
