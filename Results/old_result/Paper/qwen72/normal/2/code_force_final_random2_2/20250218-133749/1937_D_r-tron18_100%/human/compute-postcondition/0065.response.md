The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `ans[i]` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `i` is set to `n - 3`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`.

Given the initial state:
- `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`.

After executing the code:
- `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
