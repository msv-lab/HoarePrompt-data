Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is (abs(xa - xb) // 2), `l` is max(1, yb - x)**

Explanation: The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum between 1 and `yb - x`. The value of `x` is given as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, which remains unchanged. All other variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `i`, `t`) retain their original values. The new variable `l` is introduced with the value `max(1, yb - x)`.
