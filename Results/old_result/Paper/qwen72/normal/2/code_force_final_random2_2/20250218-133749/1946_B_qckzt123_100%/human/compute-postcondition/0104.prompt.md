Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `tmp` is 0 if `x` (the first element in the list `a`) is less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains `x`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the maximum of the original `t` and `tmp`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `t` remains 0, and `ans` is `((s + 0 * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the maximum of the original `t` and the updated `tmp` (`tmp + x`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `i` is `k-2`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `t` remains 0, and `ans` is `((s + 0 * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Otherwise, `t` is the maximum of the original `t` and `tmp`, and `ans` is `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
