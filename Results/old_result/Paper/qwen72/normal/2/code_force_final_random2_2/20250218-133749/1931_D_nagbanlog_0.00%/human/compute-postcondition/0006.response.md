Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple.
- `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

The `print` statement will output a formatted string with the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` as described in the initial state.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n] is the first value from case['params'], [x] is the second value from case['params'], [y] is the third value from case['params'], and [a] is the array from case['array'])**
