Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is assigned the element from the list `l` at the index `x`, which is `y + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
