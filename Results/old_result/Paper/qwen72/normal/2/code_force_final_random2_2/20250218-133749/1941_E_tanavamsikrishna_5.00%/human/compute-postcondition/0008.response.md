The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `costs`. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 0 to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `len(costs)` must be greater than `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. This means `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is now a list containing two elements, where the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the second element is the sum of the elements from index `i` (which is 2) to `i + k` (which is `2 + k`) of `costs`. `i` is 2, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.**
