The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context, it implicitly processes a set of `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32. Each test case contains a string of length 5, consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.
