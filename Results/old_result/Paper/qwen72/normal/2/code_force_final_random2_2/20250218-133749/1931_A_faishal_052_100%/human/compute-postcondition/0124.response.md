Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` now contains the integer 26 at the end, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 78, the variables remain unchanged.***
