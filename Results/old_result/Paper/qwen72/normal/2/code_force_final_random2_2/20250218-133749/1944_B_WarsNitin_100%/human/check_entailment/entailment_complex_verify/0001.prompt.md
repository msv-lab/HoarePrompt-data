You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0, `q` is `t - 1`, `ans1` and `ans2` contain the selected elements based on the conditions specified in the loop, `k` is `max(0, req - 2 * m - len(l))` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true, `l` contains the unique elements from `b` and `c` that were not paired, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `n` remain unchanged for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts them, and then selects elements based on specific conditions to form two lists `ans1` and `ans2`. These lists are printed as the output for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Array Splitting:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted to facilitate the selection of elements.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized to store the selected elements for `l` and `r` respectively.
   - A variable `k` is set to `2 * k` to account for the required number of elements in each list.
   - A list `l` is initialized to store unique elements from `b`.

5. **Selecting Elements from `b`:**
   - The function checks the first and last elements of `b` to see if they are unique and adds them to `l` if necessary.
   - It then iterates through the middle elements of `b`:
     - If an element appears twice consecutively, it adds both occurrences to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
     - If an element is unique, it adds it to `l`.

6. **Selecting Elements from `c`:**
   - The function iterates through the elements of `c`:
     - If an element appears twice consecutively, it adds both occurrences to `ans2` and decreases `k` by 2.

7. **Balancing `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - If there are still elements needed to fill `ans1` and `ans2`, it uses the unique elements stored in `l` to balance the counts.

8. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly splits the array and sorts the halves.
- It attempts to select elements to ensure the XOR condition is met.
- However, the logic for selecting unique elements and balancing the counts might not always guarantee the correct solution, especially in edge cases where the distribution of elements is uneven.

### Conclusion:
The function's approach is generally sound, but it might fail in specific edge cases where the distribution of elements in `b` and `c` is not balanced. Therefore, the correctness of the function cannot be guaranteed in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
