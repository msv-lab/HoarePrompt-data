To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `n` is the new input integer (relevant to the loop head)
   - `j` is `n-1` (initial value, but will be reset by the loop)
   - `b` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `a` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `j` is `n-1`, but this will be reset by the loop to start from 0.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will be set to 0 by the loop.

### State:
**`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `a` is 0**
