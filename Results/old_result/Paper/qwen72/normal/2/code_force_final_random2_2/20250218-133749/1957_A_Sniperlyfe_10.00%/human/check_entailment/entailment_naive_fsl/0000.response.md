Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with sides greater than 4. The function `func_1` divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which assumes that only squares (4-sided polygons) can be constructed. However, the problem statement allows for the construction of any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). For example, if the input is `[3, 3, 3]`, the program will return 0, but the correct output should be 1 because a triangle can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
