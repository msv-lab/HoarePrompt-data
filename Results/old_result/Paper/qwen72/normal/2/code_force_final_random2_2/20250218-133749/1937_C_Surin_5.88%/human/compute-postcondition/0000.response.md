The code defines a function `I` which reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, maps each element to an integer, and returns the resulting list. This function does not modify any existing variables but provides a way to read and process input.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4. A function `I` is defined to read a list of integers from input.**
