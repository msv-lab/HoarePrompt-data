Output State: **`a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - 2 * a[l] ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is increased by 1, `sunks` remains unchanged if `l` equals `r`.**
