Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

# Annotated Program:
from heapq import *

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot and appears at the top of their own list. All authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and no 'break' statements were triggered, so the final output is 'yes'. The variables `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` retain their values as described in the initial state, with the additional condition that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` is equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a chat scenario with `n` participants and `k` participants who have posted screenshots. The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the order of participants shown to each screenshot poster. It then determines whether the order of participants can be consistently aligned across all screenshots. If the orders are consistent, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any values but outputs the result for each test case directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
