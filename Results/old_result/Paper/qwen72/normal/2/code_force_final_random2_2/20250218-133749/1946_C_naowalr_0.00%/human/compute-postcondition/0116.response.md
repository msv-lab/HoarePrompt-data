Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50000 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50000.***
