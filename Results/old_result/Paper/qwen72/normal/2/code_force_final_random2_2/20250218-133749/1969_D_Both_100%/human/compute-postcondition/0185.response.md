Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is now `current_profit - item[1]` if `combined` is not empty and `removed_item` is not None, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, or `None` if `removed_item` does not exist, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `combined` is now one tuple shorter.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_profit -= item[1]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the second element of the `item` tuple (`item[1]`) from `current_profit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
