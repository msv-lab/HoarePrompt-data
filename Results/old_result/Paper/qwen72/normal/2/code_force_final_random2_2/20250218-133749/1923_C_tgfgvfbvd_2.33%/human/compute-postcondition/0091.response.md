Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**

Explanation:
- The variable `c` was initially the sum of all elements in `l`, but after executing `c = 0`, `c` is now 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `x`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
