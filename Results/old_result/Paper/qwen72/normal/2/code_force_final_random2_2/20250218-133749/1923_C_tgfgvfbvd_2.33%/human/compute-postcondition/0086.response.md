Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. For each iteration, if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `a - 2`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met and "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `m` times, and after all iterations, `m` will be 0.
- The variables `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- For each iteration, `a` and `b` are read from input, and `s` is calculated based on the conditions provided.
- The condition checks whether the segment sum `s` meets the criteria, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
