Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - We need to determine the value of `mexsize % 2` to decide whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' will be printed.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize` in the sequence of positive integers.
   - For example, if `maxsize` is 5, then `mexsize` would be 6 because 6 is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` (assuming 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are in the list).

4. **Determine `mexsize % 2`:**
   - If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize` (which is `maxsize + 1`) will be odd.
   - If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize` (which is `maxsize + 1`) will be even.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `mexsize` is always `maxsize + 1`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will alternate between even and odd depending on the parity of `maxsize`.
   - However, the problem does not specify the exact value of `maxsize`, but we know that `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`.

Given that `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even. Therefore, the print statement will check if `mexsize` is even or odd.

- If `mexsize` is even, 'Alice' will be printed.
- If `mexsize` is odd, 'Bob' will be printed.

Since `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even. Given the problem's constraints, we can conclude that `mexsize` will be even.

Output: **Alice**
