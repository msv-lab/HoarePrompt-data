To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`. In this case:
   - `start` is `len(num) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1` (exclusive)
   - `step` is `-1` (decrementing)

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `start` is greater than or equal to `stop` when considering the step direction.
   - Since the step is `-1`, the loop will execute if `len(num) - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.
   - This means `len(num)` must be greater than `0`.
   - Therefore, `num` must be a non-empty string.

5. **Initial State**:
   - `num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num`.
   - `tot` is 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` should be initialized to `len(num) - 1` for the first iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a non-empty string, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
