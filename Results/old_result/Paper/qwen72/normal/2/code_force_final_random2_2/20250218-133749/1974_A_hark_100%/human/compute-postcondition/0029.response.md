Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `bxsfory` is undefined, `bxsfory1` is undefined. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, the program follows the if part. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the else part.***
