To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `x` and `y` are integers read from input.
   - `ap` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `bxsfory` is undefined.
   - `bxsfory1` is undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(x / 15))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result of the division `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
   - The value of `x` is an integer read from input, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.
   - Since `x` is an integer, `x / 15` will be a floating-point number.
   - `math.ceil(x / 15)` will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact value of `x` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `x / 15`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is the integer read from input)**
