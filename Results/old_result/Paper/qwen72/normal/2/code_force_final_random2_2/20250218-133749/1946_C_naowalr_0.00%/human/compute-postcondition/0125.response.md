Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `R - L` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is specifically calculated as `(L + R) // 2`.
