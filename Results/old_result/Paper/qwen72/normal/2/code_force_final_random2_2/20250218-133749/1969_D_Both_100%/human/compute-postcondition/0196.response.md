The function `func_4` does not explicitly define its parameters within the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `test_cases`: A positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: A non-negative integer.
- `k`: A non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n.
- `prices`: A list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items.
- `bonuses`: A list of integers representing the prices Bob pays for the items, with the same length as `prices`.

Given these parameters, the function's output is not specified in the problem statement. However, typically, such a function would compute some result based on the provided inputs, such as a total cost, a difference, or a specific condition being met.

Since the exact output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `test_cases`, a non-negative integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` where 0 <= k <= n, a list of integers `prices` representing the prices Alice pays for the items, and a list of integers `bonuses` representing the prices Bob pays for the items, with the same length as `prices`. The function computes and returns a result based on these inputs, though the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
