The value of `c[i]` is appended to `ans2`. Since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and `i` is 1, `c[1]` is appended to `ans2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req` (and its current value is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true), `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]`.**
