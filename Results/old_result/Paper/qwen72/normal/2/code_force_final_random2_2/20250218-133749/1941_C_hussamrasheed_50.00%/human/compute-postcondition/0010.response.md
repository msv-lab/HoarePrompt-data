Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to a new input string.
- The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged except for `s`, which now holds the new input string.
- The number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s` (stored in `m`) and the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s` (stored in `p`) are not recalculated, but their definitions remain valid based on the new value of `s`.
