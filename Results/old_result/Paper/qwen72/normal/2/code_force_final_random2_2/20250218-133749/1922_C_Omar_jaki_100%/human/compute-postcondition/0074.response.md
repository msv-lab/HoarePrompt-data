Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with 4 elements.
- `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
- `z` is `2000000000.0`.
- `u` is `-1`.
- `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`.
- `x` is the new value of `c`.
- `y` is the new value of `d`.
- `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`).
- `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
- If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`.
- If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`.
   - Let's assume `r()` returns two values, say `c_new` and `d_new`.
   - After the update, `c = c_new` and `d = d_new`.

2. **Calculating `v`**:
   - `v` is `d - c` with the new values of `d` and `c`.
   - So, `v = d_new - c_new`.

3. **Extending `b`**:
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`.
   - This means the last two elements of `b` are added to the list, where the last element is `b[-2] + v`.

4. **Conditions on `c` and `d`**:
   - If `c_new < d_new`, then `c` remains less than `d`.
   - If `c_new >= d_new`, then `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

5. **Indexing `b`**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])`.
   - We need to determine the values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `r()` returns `c_new = 2` and `d_new = 3` (for simplicity).

- `c = 2`
- `d = 3`
- `v = d - c = 3 - 2 = 1`
- `b` is extended by `b[-2] + v`.

Assume `b` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- `b[-2] = 3`
- `b[-2] + v = 3 + 1 = 4`
- `b` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]` (assuming the last element was 4).

Now, we need to calculate:
- `b[c * 2 - 1] = b[2 * 2 - 1] = b[3] = 4`
- `b[d * 2 - 1] = b[3 * 2 - 1] = b[5] = 5`

So, the print statement will output:
- `4 - 5 = -1`

### Final Output:
Output: **-1 (where the values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` depend on the specific values of `c` and `d` after being updated by `r()`)**
