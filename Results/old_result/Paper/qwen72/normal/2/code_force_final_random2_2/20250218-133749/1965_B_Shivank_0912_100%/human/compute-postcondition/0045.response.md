The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. 

- If `j` equals `i`, then `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.
- If `j` is 2, then `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.

In both cases, the value `1 << j` is appended to `ans`.

Let's calculate the new state:

1. **If `j` equals `i`:**
   - `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 1 << i]`.

2. **If `j` is 2:**
   - `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]` (since `1 << 2` is 4).

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `j` is either `i` or 2, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 1 << j]`.**
