Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` must have at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`. If `op` (the 29th bit of `val`) is 0, then `ai` is 0 and `t` now contains `val` as its last element. Otherwise, `ai` remains `val` and `t` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` has at least two elements, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the XOR of the original `op` and the 29th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is False, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, and `t` is now `t` with `ai` appended to it if `op` is False, otherwise `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 28, `u` is `x >> 28 & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a])`, `a` has at least three elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the XOR of the original `op` and the 29th bit of the second element of `a`, and the 29th bit of the third element of `a`, `ai` is 0, and `t` is a list containing the value 0 if `op` is 0. Otherwise, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, and `t` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
