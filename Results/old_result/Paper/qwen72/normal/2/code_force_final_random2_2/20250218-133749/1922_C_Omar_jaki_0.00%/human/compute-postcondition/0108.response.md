To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 2.
2. `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by `r()`.
3. The relationship between `c` and `d` is updated accordingly:
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `u`**:
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 2. This means `u` could be any integer except 0, and it is reduced by 2. For example, if `u` was initially 5, then `u` would be 3 after the decrease.

2. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are assigned values returned by the function `r()`. The function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are integers.

3. **Relationship between `c` and `d`**:
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c < d`.
   - Otherwise, `c >= d`.

4. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we do not know the exact values of the elements in `b`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

- The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates an index in the list `b` based on the value of `d`.
- Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` calculates an index in the list `b` based on the value of `c`.
- The difference between the elements at these indices is printed.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the list `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the subtraction. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and the list.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list, c and d are integers such that c is less than d or c is greater than or equal to d)**
