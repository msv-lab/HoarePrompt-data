Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \) must hold true.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. The string `'NO'` is a constant and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
