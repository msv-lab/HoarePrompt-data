Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue in `func_1` that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the rules specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Support Placement Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost of placing supports in a row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - However, the current implementation only updates the cost for the first `d-1` elements and then uses a sliding window to find the minimum cost for the rest of the elements. This approach does not ensure that the distance constraint is always met.

2. **Edge Case Failure**:
   - Consider a row where the depth values are such that the optimal placement of supports would require placing them at specific intervals to meet the distance constraint. The current implementation might place supports in suboptimal positions, leading to an incorrect total cost.

3. **Example Case**:
   - For a row `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` with `d = 4`, the correct placement of supports should ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than 3 (since `d - 1 = 3`). The current implementation might place supports in a way that violates this constraint, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

To fix this, the function `func_1` needs to be revised to ensure that the distance constraint is always met, and the cost is calculated correctly for all possible placements of supports.
