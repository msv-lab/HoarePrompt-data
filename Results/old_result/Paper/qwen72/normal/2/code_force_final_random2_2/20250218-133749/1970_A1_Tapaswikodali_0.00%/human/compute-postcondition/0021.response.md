The `details.sort()` function sorts the list `details` based on the tuples contained within it. Each tuple in `details` is in the form `(balance, -i, char)`. Since `balance` is 0 for all entries (because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence), the sorting will primarily depend on the second element `-i` (the negative index). The third element `char` will not affect the sorting order since the first two elements already uniquely determine the order.

Given that `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the negative indices will range from `-1` to `-(len(s) - 1)`. Sorting these negative indices will effectively sort the list in ascending order of the original indices (from 0 to `len(s) - 1`).

Therefore, after sorting, the `details` list will contain the tuples in the same order as the characters appear in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `i` is the index of the last character in `s`, which is `len(s) - 1`. `char` is the last character of `s`. `balance` is 0. `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in `s`, sorted in the order they appear in `s`, where each tuple is in the form `(0, -i, char)` representing the balance at that point, the negative index, and the character itself.**
