The code snippet creates a list named `nums` that contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{20}\). Each element in the list is calculated using the left shift operator `<<`, which effectively multiplies 1 by \(2^i\) for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to 20.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 1 to 1048576 (i.e., \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).**
