To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements.
- `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the value of `sm`.
- `i` is 2.
- `sm` is the sum of the initial `sm` (which was 0) and the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the last index of `a`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `len(a) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is the last index of `a`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, but since `j` is already the last index of `a`, it cannot be incremented further without exceeding the bounds of the list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`.
- Since `j` is already the last index of `a`, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is less than `len(a)`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will not execute again because `j` is already at the last index of `a`.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from the second element to the last element plus the value of `sm`, `i` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the initial `sm` (which was 0) and the last element of `a`, and `j` is the last index of `a`**.
