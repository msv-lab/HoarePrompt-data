Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `val` is an empty list, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, the program control moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
