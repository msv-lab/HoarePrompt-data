Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`, `one` is `one + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `one` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `one_perc`, `i`, and the condition for updating `lst` remain as described in the initial state.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
