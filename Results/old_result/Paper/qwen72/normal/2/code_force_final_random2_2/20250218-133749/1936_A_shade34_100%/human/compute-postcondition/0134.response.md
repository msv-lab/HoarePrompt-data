Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `mak` is either 0 or `n-1`.
- `mak2` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
- `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- The last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.
  - If the last user input is ">", `mak` is set to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the last user input `s` is ">", then `mak` is set to `n-1`.
   - If the last user input `s` is not ">", then `mak` remains 0.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is always `n`.

3. **Access the elements in `pans`:**
   - `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[0]` or `pans[n-1]` depending on the value of `mak`.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[n]` since `i` is `n`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If the last user input `s` is ">":**
  - `mak` is `n-1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]`.

- **If the last user input `s` is not ">":**
  - `mak` is 0.
  - The print statement will output: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[n-1]`, and `pans[n]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their indices in the list `pans`.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[n] pans[n] (where mak is n-1 if the last user input is ">", otherwise mak is 0, and n is the input integer)**
