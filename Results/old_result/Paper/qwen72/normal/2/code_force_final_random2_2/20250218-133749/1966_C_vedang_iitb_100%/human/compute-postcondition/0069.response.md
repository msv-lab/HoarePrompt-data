Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the smallest positive integer not present in the list (`mexsize`). It then prints 'Alice' if `mexsize` is even and `mexsize` is greater than the maximum value in the list, or if `mexsize` is odd and `mexsize` is less than or equal to the maximum value in the list. Otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
