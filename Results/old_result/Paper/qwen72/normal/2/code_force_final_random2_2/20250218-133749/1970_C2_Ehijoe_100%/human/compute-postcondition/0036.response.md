The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. `n` and `t` are integers with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1. `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes, and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node. `start` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the game.

The function returns the result of a game or simulation that starts from the node specified by `start` and explores the graph represented by `nodes`.
