The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is the first element of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 elements. The next element in `s` will become the new `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 1] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**
