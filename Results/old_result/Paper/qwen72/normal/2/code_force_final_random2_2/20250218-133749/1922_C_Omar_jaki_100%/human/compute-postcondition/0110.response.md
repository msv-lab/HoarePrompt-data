Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least 7 elements:
  - The first element is `-1000000000.0`.
  - The next five elements are returned by `r()`.
  - The last element is `2000000000.0`.
- `w` is the fourth element of `a`.
- `x` is the fifth element of `a`.
- `y` is the sixth element of `a`.
- `z` is the seventh element of `a`.
- `u` is `-1`.
- `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`.
- `t` is `False`.
- If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), r(), r(), r(), 2000000000.0]`
   - `w = a[3]` (fourth element)
   - `x = a[4]` (fifth element)
   - `y = a[5]` (sixth element)
   - `z = a[6]` (seventh element)

2. **Variable `v`**:
   - `v = y - x`

3. **List `b`**:
   - `b = [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`

4. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are new values returned by `r()`.
   - The condition `if c < d` is always true because it is a tautology (it states itself).

5. **Indices in List `b`**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` are accessed based on the values of `c` and `d`.

6. **Calculation**:
   - We need to find the values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` and then compute their difference.

### Possible Values:
- Since `c` and `d` are random values, let's assume they are integers between 1 and 5 (since `b` has 10 elements).
- For simplicity, let's assume `c = 1` and `d = 2` (this is just an example; the actual values depend on the random function `r()`).

### Example Calculation:
- If `c = 1` and `d = 2`:
  - `b[(d - 1) * 2] = b[(2 - 1) * 2] = b[2] = v`
  - `b[(c - 1) * 2] = b[(1 - 1) * 2] = b[0] = 0`
  - The result of the print statement would be `v - 0 = v`.

### General Case:
- The exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, but the calculation will always be `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
- The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` will always point to valid elements in the list `b`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the difference between the elements at the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list [0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v] and v is y - x, with y and x being the sixth and fifth elements of the list a, respectively)**
