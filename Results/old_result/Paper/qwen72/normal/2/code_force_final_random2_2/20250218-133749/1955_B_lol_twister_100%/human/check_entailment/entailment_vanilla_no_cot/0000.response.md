Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if the given array `b` can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The function `func_1` reconstructs the progressive square based on the minimum value in the array and the given rules, then compares the sorted reconstructed array with the sorted input array to determine if they match. If they do, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'. This approach is consistent with the problem's requirements and constraints.
