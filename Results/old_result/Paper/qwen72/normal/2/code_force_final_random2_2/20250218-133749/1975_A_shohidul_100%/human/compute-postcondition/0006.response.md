Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `check_all` is True, indicating that the list `a` is non-decreasing up to the index `n-1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
