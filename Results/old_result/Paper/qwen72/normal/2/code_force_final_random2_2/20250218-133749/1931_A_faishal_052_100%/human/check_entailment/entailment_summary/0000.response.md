Reasoning:

The program aims to decode an integer back into a lexicographically smallest three-letter word based on the sum of their positions in the alphabet. Here's a detailed analysis of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then attempts to fill `arr` with three values that sum up to the encoded integer `lex`.
   - The logic for filling `arr` is flawed:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where `lex` is between 28 and 52 properly.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where `lex` is between 52 and 78 properly.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is redundant and incorrect for the same reason as above.

3. **Sorting and Conversion**:
   - After filling `arr`, the program sorts it to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then converts the values in `arr` to characters by adding 96 (since 'a' is at position 1, which corresponds to ASCII 97).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting three-letter word for each test case.

### Issues:
- The logic for filling `arr` is incorrect. It should handle the cases more carefully to ensure the correct values are appended.
- The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the sum of the positions can be split in multiple ways.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the values in `arr` are chosen such that they sum up to `lex` and form the lexicographically smallest word. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Try to maximize the last two positions while keeping the first position as small as possible
        for i in range(26, 0, -1):
            if lex - i >= 2:
                arr[2] = i
                lex -= i
                break
        
        for i in range(26, 0, -1):
            if lex - i >= 1:
                arr[1] = i
                lex -= i
                break
        
        arr[0] = lex
        
        # Convert to characters
        result = ''.join(chr(x + 96) for x in arr)
        print(result)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
- We start by trying to maximize the last position (`arr[2]`) while ensuring the remaining sum is at least 2.
- We then maximize the second position (`arr[1]`) while ensuring the remaining sum is at least 1.
- The first position (`arr[0]`) is set to the remaining value.
- Finally, we convert the values to characters and print the result.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
