Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**

Explanation:
- The line `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the integers provided by the user input.
- The rest of the variables (`l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
