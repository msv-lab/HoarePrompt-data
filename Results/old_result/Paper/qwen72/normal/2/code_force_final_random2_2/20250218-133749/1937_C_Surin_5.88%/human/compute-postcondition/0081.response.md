Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is `n - 1`.
- `r` is the user input.
- `prev` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: According to the initial state, `v1` is defined as `n - 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `v1` will be a positive integer.
2. **`i`**: `i` is explicitly set to 1.
3. **`prev`**: `prev` is explicitly set to 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- `v1` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.

### Final Output:
The print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string:
```python
print(f'? {n-1} {1} {n-1} {0}')
```

### Explanation:
- The first `{v1}` will be replaced by `n - 1`.
- The second `{i}` will be replaced by 1.
- The third `{v1}` will be replaced by `n - 1`.
- The fourth `{prev}` will be replaced by 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0 (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
