The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`.

- `a` and `x` are now assigned new values from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `a` and `x` are input integers.**
