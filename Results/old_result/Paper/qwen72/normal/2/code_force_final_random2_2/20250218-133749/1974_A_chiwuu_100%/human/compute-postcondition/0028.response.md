The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2`, which means `t` is now equal to the floor division of its original value by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `t` is equal to `b // 2`, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the second integer read from the input (now converted to an integer), `t1` is equal to `b * 15 - b * 4`.**
