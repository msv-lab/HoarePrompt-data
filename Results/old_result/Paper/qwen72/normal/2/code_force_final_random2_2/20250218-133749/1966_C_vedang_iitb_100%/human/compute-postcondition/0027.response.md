The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, or `mexsize`. However, the order of elements in the list `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than the maximum value in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
