Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.** 

The value of `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without regard to order. All other variables remain unchanged.
