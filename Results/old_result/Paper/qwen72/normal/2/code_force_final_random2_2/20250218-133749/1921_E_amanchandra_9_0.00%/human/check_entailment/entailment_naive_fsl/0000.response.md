Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the outcome when Alice and Bob are in positions that would lead to a draw but the current logic incorrectly outputs "Alice" or "Bob".

Consider the following test case:
```
h = 5, w = 5, xa = 1, ya = 3, xb = 5, yb = 3
```
In this case, Alice starts at (1, 3) and Bob starts at (5, 3). Since Alice can only move down, down-left, or down-right, and Bob can only move up, up-left, or up-right, they will never meet in the middle because they are on the same vertical line. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" instead of "Draw" for this case. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential scenarios, leading to an incorrect result.
