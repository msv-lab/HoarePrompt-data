You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the strings to find a specific pattern and outputs a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is constructed based on the positions where certain conditions are met in the input strings. The integer `t` represents the length of a matching substring found during the processing, or 1 if no such match is found. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them using a loop. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the two rows of the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the path changes from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the grid columns to determine the optimal path:
     - If the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1', it updates `y` to the current index.
     - If the next cell in the top row is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the top row up to the current index and the bottom row from the current index onwards, and sets `x` to the current index. This ensures that the path takes the lexicographically smallest string.
     - If no such change is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last cell of the bottom row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if there are multiple paths that yield the same string. Specifically, it checks if the substring of the bottom row from `y` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of the constructed string `s`. If it does, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths from `y` to `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the top and bottom rows and switching to the bottom row when necessary.
- The counting of paths is also handled correctly by checking for matching substrings.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The use of `print(s, sep='')` is unnecessary because `s` is already a string. Simply `print(s)` would suffice.
- The logic for counting paths might be overly complex. The program should ensure that it correctly counts all possible paths that yield the same string.

### Conclusion:
Despite minor issues in the output formatting and potentially complex path counting, the core logic of the program appears to be correct and should handle the given problem effectively.
