You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the t test cases consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and (x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b).

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `t - 1`, and `t` remains unchanged. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset to new integers from the input for each iteration. For each iteration, if `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. Each test case is read as six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - If `xa > xb`, it means Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, so Alice cannot move down anymore, and the game ends in a draw. This is correctly handled by printing "Draw".

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance between Alice's and Bob's chips in the vertical direction is calculated as `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - The modulo operation `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is used to determine if the distance is odd or even.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is odd, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates where Alice can move her chip to win.
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the range of y-coordinates.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if Alice can move her chip within this range to win. If true, "Alice" is printed; otherwise, "Draw" is printed.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance is even, the function calculates the range of possible y-coordinates where Bob can move his chip to win.
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the range of y-coordinates.
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if Bob can move his chip within this range to win. If true, "Bob" is printed; otherwise, "Draw" is printed.

### Correctness:
The logic in the program appears to correctly handle the conditions for determining the winner or a draw based on the problem description. The conditions for Alice and Bob winning are well-defined and the program correctly prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
