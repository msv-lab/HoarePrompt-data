Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26 depending on the initial conditions, and `arr` is [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions.** 

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial state of `arr`, the new state of `arr` will be `[1, 26]` if it was initially `[1]`, `[26, 26]` if it was initially `[26]`, or `[26]` if it was initially an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
