Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain as integers, unchanged from their initial state.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will be one more than the last value it was set to in the loop, which is `min(n, m) + 1`.
- **`t` and `T`**: These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This sum is computed over all iterations of the loop.
