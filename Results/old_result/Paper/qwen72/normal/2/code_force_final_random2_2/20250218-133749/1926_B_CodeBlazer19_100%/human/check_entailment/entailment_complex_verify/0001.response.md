### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads each row of the grid as a string.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., a triangle was detected), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The function only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if it is part of a triangle. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, but they must be arranged in a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.). The current logic will incorrectly identify any row with exactly one '1' as a triangle, even if it is part of a square.
- **Incorrect Square Detection**: The function assumes that if any row has more than one '1', it must be part of a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and the function does not check the pattern of these '1's.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Triangle Pattern**:
  - A triangle has a specific pattern where the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 (1, 3, 5, etc.) or decreases by 2 (5, 3, 1).
  - The function does not check for this pattern. It only checks if a row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a triangle.

- **Square Pattern**:
  - A square has a consistent number of '1's in each row (k consecutive '1's in each of the k rows).
  - The function does not check for this consistency. It only checks if a row has more than one '1', which is not sufficient to identify a square.

### Example Cases:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    000
    011
    011
    ```
  - Expected Output: `SQUARE`
  - Actual Output: `SQUARE`
  - **Reason**: The function correctly identifies the square because all rows have more than one '1'.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    4
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110
    ```
  - Expected Output: `TRIANGLE`
  - Actual Output: `TRIANGLE`
  - **Reason**: The function correctly identifies the triangle because the third row has exactly one '1'.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input:
    ```
    5
    00111
    00010
    00000
    00000
    00000
    ```
  - Expected Output: `TRIANGLE`
  - Actual Output: `SQUARE`
  - **Reason**: The function incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it does not check the pattern of '1's. The third row has exactly one '1', but the function does not recognize the triangle pattern.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly detect the shapes based on the problem description. It fails to account for the specific patterns required for triangles and squares.

### Correctness:
**False**
