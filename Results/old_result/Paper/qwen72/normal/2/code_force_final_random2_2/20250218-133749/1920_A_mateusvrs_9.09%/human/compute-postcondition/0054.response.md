Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is either a list containing [0] if `bx` ≥ `ax`, or a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax`. `n` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all input integers `x` when `a` is 1, otherwise it remains -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `bx` < `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ax` is updated to 1000000007.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `bx`, `cx`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
