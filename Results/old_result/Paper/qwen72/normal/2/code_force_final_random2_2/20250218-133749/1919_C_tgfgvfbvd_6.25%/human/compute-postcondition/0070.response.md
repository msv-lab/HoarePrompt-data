Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`; otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[y + 3]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then: if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.***
