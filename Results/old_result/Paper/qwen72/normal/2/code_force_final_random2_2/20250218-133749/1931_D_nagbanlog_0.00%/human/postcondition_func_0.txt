The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful" pairs in the list `a`. A "beautiful" pair `(a[i], a[j])` is defined as a pair where `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs for the corresponding test case.
