Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `c` is the first element of `s`, and `c` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between the number of 0s in `s` (`zeroes`) and the count of 0s in `cnt` (`cnt[0]`). Since `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, but `cnt[0]` remains 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `zeroes - 0`, which simplifies to `zeroes`. All other variables remain unchanged.
