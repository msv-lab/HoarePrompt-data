Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `ii` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`).
   - `y` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a`, which is `a[n-1]`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a` (since `i` is `n - 1` and `i` is the index of the last element).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

4. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(r - 1) * n`: This part of the expression multiplies the last element of the list `a` minus 1 by the length of the list `a`.
   - `+ 1`: Adds 1 to the result.
   - `+ rem`: Adds the value of `rem` (which is 0).
   - `+ y`: Adds the value of `y` (which is 0).

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression simplifies to: `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the list a and n is the length of the list a)**
