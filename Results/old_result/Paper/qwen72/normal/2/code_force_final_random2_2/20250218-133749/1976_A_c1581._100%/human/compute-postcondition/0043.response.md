Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `password` as input, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and has a length between 1 and 20 characters. It separates the digits and letters from the `password`, sorts them in ascending order, and then checks if the sorted combination of digits followed by letters matches the original `password`. The function returns `True` if the sorted combination matches the original `password`, and `False` otherwise. **
