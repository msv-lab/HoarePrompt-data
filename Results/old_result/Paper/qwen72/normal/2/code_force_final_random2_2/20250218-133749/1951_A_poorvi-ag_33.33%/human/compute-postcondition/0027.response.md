The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', `results` now includes 'no' as its last element. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'yes' as its last element.**
