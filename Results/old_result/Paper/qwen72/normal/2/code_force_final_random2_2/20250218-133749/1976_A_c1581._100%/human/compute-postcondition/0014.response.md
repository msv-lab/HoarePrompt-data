The code snippet `letters.append(char)` appends the current value of `char` to the list `letters`. Given the initial state, `char` is a character from the string `password`, and if `char` is not a digit, it is added to the list `letters`.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `letters` is a list containing `char` as its last element, and `digits` remains unchanged.**
