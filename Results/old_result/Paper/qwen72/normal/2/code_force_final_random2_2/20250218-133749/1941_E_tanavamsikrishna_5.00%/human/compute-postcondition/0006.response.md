To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```
This means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Current State
- `i` is 0
- `len(costs)` must be at least `k`

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
2. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
4. **Check Condition**: After incrementing `i` to 1, the condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Given that `len(costs)` must be at least `k`, the condition `len(costs) - (k - 1)` simplifies to `len(costs) - k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again:
- `i` must be 1
- `len(costs) - k + 1` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `len(costs) > k`.

### Adjusted State
- `i` is 1
- `len(costs)` must be greater than `k`

### Final State
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four space-separated integers from the input. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from a separate line of input. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and `d` as arguments. `total_costs` is now a list containing one element, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`. `i` is 1, `len(costs)` must be greater than `k`.**
