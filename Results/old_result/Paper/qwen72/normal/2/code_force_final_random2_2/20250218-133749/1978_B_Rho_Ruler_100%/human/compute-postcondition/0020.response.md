To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head, which is `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.
- `low` is updated based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`.
- `high` is updated based on the same comparison.
- `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
- `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are calculated using `func_1`.
- `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be true. This means that `low` should be less than or equal to `high`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `low` could have been updated to `mid + 1` or remained the same.
- `high` could have been updated to the minimum of `n` and `b` or to `mid - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` and `high` are the only variables in the loop head, we need to ensure that `low` is not greater than `high`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is less than or equal to `high`**
