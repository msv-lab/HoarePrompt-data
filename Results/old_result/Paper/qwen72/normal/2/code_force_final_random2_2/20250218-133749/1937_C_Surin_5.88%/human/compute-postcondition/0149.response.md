Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 1 and 10^3.
- **`kp`**: Remains 2.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 1, as the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`g`**: Remains 0.
- **`v1`**: Remains `n-1`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`v2`**: Remains `n-1`.
- **`r`**: Is the final user input received during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`prev`**: Will be the last index where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'.
- **`sys.stdout.flush()`**: Has been called multiple times, once per iteration of the loop.
