The code snippet `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' within the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.**
