The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are strings representing the first and second parts of the input, respectively.**
