Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the largest integer value such that \(2^i\) is less than or equal to `k`. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
