Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` zeros except `dp[n]` which is 1, `offset` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    for j in range(2 * n + 1):
        if dp[j] > 0:
            if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
            if j - 1 >= 0:
                new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
    dp = new_dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop. Specifically, `dp` will have non-zero values at indices `n-1` and `n+1` (if they exist), and potentially further indices depending on the number of iterations and the value of `MOD`. The exact values in `dp` depend on the cumulative effect of the updates from `new_dp` over all iterations. `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, and `new_dp` is no longer referenced.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, and `j` is `2 * n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
