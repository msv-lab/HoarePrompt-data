Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that has been fully iterated, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` is fully iterated over, meaning all elements in `a` have been processed by the loop.
- The list `cnt` is updated such that `cnt[i]` contains the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, which means it sums up the values of `cnt[i] - 1` for all `i` where `cnt[i]` is greater than 1.
