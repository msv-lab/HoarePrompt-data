Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance for each prefix of the input string. This is done by iterating through the string and incrementing or decrementing the balance based on whether the current character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

2. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, negative index, and character in a list of tuples. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken by position in descending order, as required.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of tuples based on the balance in ascending order and the negative index in descending order. This sorting step is crucial for achieving the desired balanced shuffle.

4. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted list of tuples and joining them into a single string.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program follows the steps required to perform the balanced shuffle operation correctly. The original assessment is accurate because:
- The balance calculation is correct.
- The sorting criteria match the problem requirements.
- The construction of the result string is done correctly.
- The program handles the input and output as specified.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
