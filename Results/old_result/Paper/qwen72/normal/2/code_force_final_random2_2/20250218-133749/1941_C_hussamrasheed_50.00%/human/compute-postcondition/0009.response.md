Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `m`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
