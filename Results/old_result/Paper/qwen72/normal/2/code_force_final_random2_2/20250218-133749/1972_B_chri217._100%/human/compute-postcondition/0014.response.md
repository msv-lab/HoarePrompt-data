Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 0 (i.e., `t` is 0), `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, s)`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, and `s` is a string read from standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

### Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times, and `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The list `cases` will contain exactly `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. Each `n` is an integer read from standard input, and each `s` is a string read from standard input and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
- The placeholder `_` is not relevant to the final state since it is just used as a discard variable in the loop.
- The initial state of `t` being a positive integer and `cases` being an empty list is transformed into `t` being 0 and `cases` containing the expected number of tuples.
