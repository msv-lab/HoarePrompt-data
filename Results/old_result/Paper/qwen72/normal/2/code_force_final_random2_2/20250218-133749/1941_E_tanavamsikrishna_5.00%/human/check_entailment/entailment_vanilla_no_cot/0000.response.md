Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge on a single row. However, it incorrectly updates the cost of installing supports. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(0, d - 1):` only increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which is not the correct way to handle the installation cost. The correct approach should consider the minimum cost of placing supports within the allowed distance `d`.
- The function `func_1` also incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports. The line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly account for the dynamic programming aspect of the problem. It should consider the minimum cost of placing a support within the last `d` positions, not just the last `d+1` positions.
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it does not handle the input format correctly. It assumes that the input is already split into individual test cases, but it does not read the number of test cases `t` at the beginning. This means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest.
- The function `func_2` also does not handle the output format correctly. It prints the result directly, but the problem statement requires the output to be formatted in a specific way, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.

To fix these issues, the functions need to be revised to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach for calculating the minimum cost and to handle the input and output formats as specified in the problem statement.
