### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The program checks if the entire array `a` is already non-decreasing using the `all` function with a generator expression.
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding a Valid Split Point:**
   - If the array is not non-decreasing, the program iterates through possible split points.
   - For each split point `i`, it creates a new array `new` which is the suffix starting from index `i`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: All elements in the new suffix `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]`.
     - `new_all`: The new suffix `new` should be non-decreasing.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid split point is found, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array is already non-decreasing.
   - It also correctly identifies valid split points where the suffix can be moved to the front to form a non-decreasing array.
   - The logic ensures that the conditions for a valid split are checked thoroughly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix. The conditions and checks are appropriate and cover all necessary cases.

**Correctness: True**
