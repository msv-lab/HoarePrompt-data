Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `r = input('')` assigns the user input to the variable `r`. The initial state specifies that if `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `r` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
