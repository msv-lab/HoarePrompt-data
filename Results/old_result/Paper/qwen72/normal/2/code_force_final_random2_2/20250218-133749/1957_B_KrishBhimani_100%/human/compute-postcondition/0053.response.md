The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` was 1 if `temp * 2` was less than `k` before execution, or 0 otherwise, the new value of `i` will be 2 if `temp * 2` was less than `k` before execution, or 1 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`, `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2` was less than `k` before execution, otherwise `temp` is 2, and `i` is 2 if `temp * 2` was less than `k` before execution, otherwise `i` is 1.**
