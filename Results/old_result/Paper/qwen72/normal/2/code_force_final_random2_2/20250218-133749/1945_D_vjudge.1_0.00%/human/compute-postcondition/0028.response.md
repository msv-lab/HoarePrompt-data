Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that were not compared with smaller elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the cumulative sum of `soma_b` at those points. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged. `resultado` is `float('inf')`.**
