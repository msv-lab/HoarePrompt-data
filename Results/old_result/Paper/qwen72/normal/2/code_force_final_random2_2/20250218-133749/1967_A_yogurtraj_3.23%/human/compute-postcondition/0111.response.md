The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` modifies the value of `k`. To determine the new value of `k`, we need to evaluate the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `ii` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `i` is 1
- `rem` is 0

Let's break down the calculation:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `i + 1` is 2.
3. `a[i + 1]` is `a[2]`.
4. `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
5. The expression `(a[i + 1] - a[i])` is `a[2] - a[1]`.
6. The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Therefore, `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * (a[2] - a[1])` from its current value.

Since the initial value of `k` is not specified, we can only express the change in `k` in terms of the given variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `rem` is 0, and `k` is decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**
