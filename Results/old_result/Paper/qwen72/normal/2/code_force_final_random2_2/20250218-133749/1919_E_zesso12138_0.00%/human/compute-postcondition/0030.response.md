Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Remains a positive integer.
2. **`n`**: Is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`.
3. **`p`**: Is a list of integers converted from the last slice of `data` used to form `p`.
4. **`input`**: Still the function `sys.stdin.read`.
5. **`data`**: Still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
6. **`index`**: Is `1 + t + (t * n)`.
7. **`results`**: Is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration and must have at least one element.
8. **`result`**: Is the return value of the last call to `func_1(n, p)`.
9. **`res`**: Is the first element of `results`.

### Analysis:
- The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
- Since `results` must have at least one element, `res` is the first element of this list.
- The `print(res)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(res)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list, which is the return value of the first call to `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the first element of the results list, which is the return value of the first call to func_1(n, p))**
