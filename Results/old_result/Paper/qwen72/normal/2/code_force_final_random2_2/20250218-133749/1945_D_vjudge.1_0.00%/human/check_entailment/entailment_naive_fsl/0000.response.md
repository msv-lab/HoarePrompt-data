Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where `k` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill) is equal to `n` (the number of people in the queue). In such a case, Kirill is already in the desired position, and no bribing is necessary. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this scenario and still performs unnecessary calculations, which could lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
2 3
1 1
```
Here, `n = 2` and `k = 2`, meaning Kirill is already in the last position, and he doesn't need to bribe anyone. The expected output should be `0` because no coins are needed. However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate and print a non-zero value.

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
