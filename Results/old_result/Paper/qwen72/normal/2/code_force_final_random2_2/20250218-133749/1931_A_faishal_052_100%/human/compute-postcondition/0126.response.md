Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex` after the loop completes. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is reduced by 2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 52. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs twice because `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
- For each iteration, the value of `lex` determines how `arr` is updated and how `lex` is modified.
- After the first iteration, if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` is reduced by 1.
- After the second iteration, if `lex` is still less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` is further reduced by 1, making the total reduction 2.
- Similarly, if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 52.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` also becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` is reduced by 52.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.
