The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` updates the value of `t` to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `y1` and `y2` are either set based on the conditions involving `y_a` and `y_b`.
- `y1` is either `y_a - 1` or `y_a + 1`.
- `y2` remains `y_b`.

Let's calculate the new value of `t`:

1. If `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `y_a - 1` and `y2` is `y_b`.
   - `t = abs(y_b - (y_a - 1)) = abs(y_b - y_a + 1)`

2. If `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is `y_a + 1` and `y2` is `y_b`.
   - `t = abs(y_b - (y_a + 1)) = abs(y_b - y_a - 1)`

Since `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the absolute difference will always be a positive integer.

Therefore, the updated value of `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `abs(y_b - y_a + 1)` if `y1` >= `y2`, or `abs(y_b - y_a - 1)` if `y1` < `y2`; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is equal to `h`; `m` is equal to `w`; `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1`; `x2` is equal to `x_b`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a - 1`, `y2` remains `y_b`, and `a` is equal to `y_b - 1`; if `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `y_a + 1`, `y2` remains `y_b`, and `a` is equal to `w - y_b`; `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
