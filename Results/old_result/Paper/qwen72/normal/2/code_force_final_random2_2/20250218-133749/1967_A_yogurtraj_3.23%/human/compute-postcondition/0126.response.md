Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `ii` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, so `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Since `k` is 0, `k // n` is 0, so `r` simplifies to `a[n - 1]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print((r - 1) * n + 1)`.
   - Substituting `r` with `a[n - 1]`, the expression becomes `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - The expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1` will be evaluated based on the value of the last element of `a` and the length of the list `a`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list a and n is the length of the list a)**
