Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `odds`, `prev` is the second element of `odds`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- `x` remains the third element of `odds`.
- `prev` remains the second element of `odds`.
- The list `odds` still has at least three elements.
- All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
