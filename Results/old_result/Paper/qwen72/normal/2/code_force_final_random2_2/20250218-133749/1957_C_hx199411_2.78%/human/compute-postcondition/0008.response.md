Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers from user input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
