The variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should still be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was updated to `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and it is already less than `len(permutation)`, no further adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]` is now `curr_v + 1`**
