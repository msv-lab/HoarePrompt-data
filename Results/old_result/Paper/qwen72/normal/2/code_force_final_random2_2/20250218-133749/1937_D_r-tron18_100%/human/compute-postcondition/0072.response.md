The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. This impacts the length of `preOne` and the value of its last element. Let's analyze the changes:

- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0.
- After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed, reducing the length of `preOne` by 1.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:

- `el` is still the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
- `s1` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5.
- `pre` is still a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is still the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- `i` is still `n - 3`.
- `ol` is still `totalOne`.
- `zr` is still `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is still `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is still calculated based on the previous conditions.
- `ans[i]` is still calculated based on the previous conditions.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, but with the last element removed, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1_result`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
