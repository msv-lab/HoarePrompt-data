Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `bx` is max(x, -1), `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `a` is 1, and `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`. Since `x` is an input integer, `bx` will be the larger of these two values.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
