To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `v` is 1.

For the loop to execute:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `i` will start at `n` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1.

Since `n` is already a positive integer (as per the given constraints), no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `n` and that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
