Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` now includes the element `a[l]` as its last element, if `s[i] == 'L'`, `b` also includes the element `a[l-1]` as its second-to-last element, and `l` is incremented by 1 (so `l` is now `l + 1`). Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.**
