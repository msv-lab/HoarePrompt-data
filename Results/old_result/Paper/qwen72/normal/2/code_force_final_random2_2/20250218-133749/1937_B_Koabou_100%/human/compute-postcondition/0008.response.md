Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times, as specified by `for _ in range(2)`.
- Each iteration of the loop appends one input string to the list `a`.
- After the loop completes, `a` will contain exactly 2 input strings.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
