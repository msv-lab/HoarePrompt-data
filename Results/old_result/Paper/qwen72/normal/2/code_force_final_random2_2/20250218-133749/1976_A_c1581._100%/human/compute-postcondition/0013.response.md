The code snippet `digits.append(char)` adds the current value of `char` to the end of the `digits` list. Since the initial state specifies that `char` is the next character in `password` and if `char` is a digit, it should be added to `digits`, this operation is valid only if `char` is indeed a digit. The `letters` list remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password` and is a digit, `digits` is a list that now includes `char` as its last element, `letters` is a list containing characters from `password` that are not digits.**
