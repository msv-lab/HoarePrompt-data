Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only counts and removes occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still form "map" or "pie" after some characters are removed.

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program will count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie".
- It will then replace "map" with an empty string, resulting in "pie".
- Finally, it will count and remove "pie".

However, the correct approach should recognize that "mappie" contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie" and should remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both. In this case, removing the 'a' and 'p' would make the string "mpie", which is still ugly. The correct solution would be to remove the 'm' and 'p' to get "apie", which is also ugly. The optimal solution is to remove the 'm' and 'p' to get "appie", which is beautiful.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle overlapping substrings and does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
