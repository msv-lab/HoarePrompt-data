Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but now missing one more tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `combined`, `combined` is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values plus the last two removed tuples. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `current_profit` is further updated to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or to `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is None, `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to the current value of `current_profit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The specific values of `current_profit` and `max_profit` depend on the previous operations, but they are now equal to each other.
