Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up ("U") coins at the start of the game. If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win because she starts first and can always make a move when there's an odd number of "U" coins, eventually leaving Bob with no moves. Conversely, if the number of "U" coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will eventually leave him with an odd number of "U" coins, allowing him to win.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case by counting the number of "U" coins, and determines the winner based on the parity of this count. It then appends "YES" or "NO" to the results list accordingly and prints the results at the end.

However, there is a minor issue with the function definition. The function `func_1` should ideally accept parameters to represent the input described in the problem, as mentioned in the comments. This would make the function more modular and easier to test. Despite this, the current implementation works correctly for the given problem statement, assuming the input is provided through standard input.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
