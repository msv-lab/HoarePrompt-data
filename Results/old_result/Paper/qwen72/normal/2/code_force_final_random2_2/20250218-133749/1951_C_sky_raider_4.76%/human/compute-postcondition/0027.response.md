Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `min(m, k)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `c`) retain their initial values or expressions.
