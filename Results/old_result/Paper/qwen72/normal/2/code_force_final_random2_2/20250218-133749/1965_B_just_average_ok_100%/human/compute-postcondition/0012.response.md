Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers from the input, `nums` is a list containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). If `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 and `i` is 1.***
