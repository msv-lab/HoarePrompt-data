Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: This is a list of characters with at least 2 elements. The exact content of `a` is not specified, but it must have at least 2 elements.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is set to 2.
3. **Indexing `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, the code will attempt to access the third element of the list `a` (since list indices start at 0).

Given that `a` has at least 2 elements, accessing `a[2]` is valid. The value of `a[2]` is the third character in the list `a`.

4. **`end=''`**: This parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after printing the character. Therefore, the character will be printed without any trailing newline.

### Output:
The code will print the third character in the list `a` without a trailing newline.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third character in the list `a`)**
