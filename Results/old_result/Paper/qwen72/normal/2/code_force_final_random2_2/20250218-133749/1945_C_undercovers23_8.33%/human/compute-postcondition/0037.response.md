Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1, and `one` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1, and `zero` remains unchanged. `zero_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50% and `one_perc` is at least 50%, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
