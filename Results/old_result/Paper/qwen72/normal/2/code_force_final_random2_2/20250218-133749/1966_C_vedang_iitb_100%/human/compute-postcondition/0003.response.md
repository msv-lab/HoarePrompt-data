The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list called `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `tc` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
