Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `mak` is 0.
- `s` is the last user input string (though it is not used in the print statement).

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

1. The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
2. `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is 0, this is `pans[0]`.
3. The next element is also `pans[mak]`, which is again `pans[0]`.
4. `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is 1, this is `pans[1]`.
5. The final element is also `pans[i]`, which is again `pans[1]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[1] is the second element of the pans list)**
