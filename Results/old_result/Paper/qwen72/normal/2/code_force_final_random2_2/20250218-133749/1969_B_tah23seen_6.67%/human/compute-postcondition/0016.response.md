To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

### Analysis:
- **`right < len(s)`**: This condition ensures that the index `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`. Since `s` contains all the characters of `sChar`, and `sChar` has a length of at least 2, `len(s)` is at least 2. Therefore, `right` must be less than this length for the loop to start.
- **`s[right] != '0'`**: This condition ensures that the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'. For the loop to execute, `s[right]` must be '1'.

### Initial State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `s[right]` is '1' while `s[left]` is '0'.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`right`**: To ensure `right < len(s)`, `right` should be an index that is valid within the list `s`. Given that `s` has at least 2 elements, `right` should be 0 or 1.
- **`s[right]`**: To ensure `s[right] != '0'`, `s[right]` should be '1'.

### Conclusion:
Given that `s[right]` is already '1' and `right` is a valid index (since `s` has at least 2 elements), no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '1' while `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 0, and `i` is the last character of `sChar`**
