The code snippet `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` updates the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the current value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`, `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, and `permutation` has been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`.**
