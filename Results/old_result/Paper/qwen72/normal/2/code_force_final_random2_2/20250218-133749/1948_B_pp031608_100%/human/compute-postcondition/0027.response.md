Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 3, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` remains True unless `arr` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False`, and `nums` is undefined or unchanged if it was previously defined.***
