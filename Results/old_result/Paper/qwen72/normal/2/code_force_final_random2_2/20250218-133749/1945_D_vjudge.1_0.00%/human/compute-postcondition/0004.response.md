The function `func_1()` is called, but there is no information provided about what `func_1()` does. Therefore, we cannot determine if it changes any variables or returns any values. Since no changes to the initial state can be determined, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1**
