Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `num` is the next element in `a`, where `a` must have at least one more element.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`num`**: This is the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` must have at least one more element, `num` is a specific integer value from the list.
2. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. Mathematically, `mod_x = num % x`.
3. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. Mathematically, `mod_y = num % y`.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This ensures that if `mod_x` is already 0, `required_mod_x` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be the smallest positive number that, when added to `mod_x`, makes the result divisible by `x`.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

### Example Values:
- Suppose `a = [10, 15, 20]`, `x = 3`, and `y = 5`.
- If `num` is the next element in `a`, let's assume `num = 15` (the second element).

### Calculations:
- `mod_x = 15 % 3 = 0`
- `mod_y = 15 % 5 = 0`
- `required_mod_x = (3 - 0) % 3 = 0`
- `required_mod_y = 0`

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
Output: **Number: 15, mod_x: 0, mod_y: 0, required_mod_x: 0, required_mod_y: 0**

This output is based on the specific example values provided. If different values are used for `a`, `x`, and `y`, the output will vary accordingly. However, the format and the logic remain the same.
