Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the smallest index such that `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[left]` must be '0', `left` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `left` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `right`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `left <= right` and `left < len(s)` still holds true after the increment.
- The condition that `s[left]` must be '0' may no longer hold true after the increment, but it is not explicitly stated that this condition must continue to hold after the increment. Therefore, it is not included in the output state.
