Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them with spaces.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, and its elements are used to construct the string `result`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`) remain in their initial states as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
