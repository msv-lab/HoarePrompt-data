The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If there are more elements in `pl`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second element of `pl`, and `pl` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` will be the third element of `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list of stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and has `n` elements, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `j` is the third element of `pl`. If `d[j]` is at least 3, `shapes` is set to 2. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
