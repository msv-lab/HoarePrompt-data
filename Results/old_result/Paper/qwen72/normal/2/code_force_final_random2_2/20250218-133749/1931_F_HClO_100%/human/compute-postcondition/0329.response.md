The code snippet `val = []` reassigns the variable `val` to an empty list. This overrides the previous value of `val`, which was a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `val` is an empty list, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
