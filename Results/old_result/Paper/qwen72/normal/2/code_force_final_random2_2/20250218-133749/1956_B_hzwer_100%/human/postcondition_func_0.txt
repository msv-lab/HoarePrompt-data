The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case involves a set of cards represented by integers. It calculates the number of cards that appear more than once in each test case and prints this count for each test case. The function processes up to \(10^4\) test cases, where each test case can have up to \(2 \times 10^5\) cards. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the count of duplicate cards for each test case.
