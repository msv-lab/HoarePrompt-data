The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` such that `gcd(x, y) == 1` and both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied. After the calculation, it prints the total count of these valid pairs. The function does not return any value.
