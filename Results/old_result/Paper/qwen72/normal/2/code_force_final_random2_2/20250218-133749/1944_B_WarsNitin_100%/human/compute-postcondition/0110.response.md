Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = []` reassigns the variable `ans2` to an empty list, overriding its previous value which was the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
