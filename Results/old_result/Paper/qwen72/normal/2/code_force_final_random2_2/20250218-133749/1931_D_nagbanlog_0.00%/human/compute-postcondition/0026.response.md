Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, all other variables remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value found in the `freq` dictionary at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
