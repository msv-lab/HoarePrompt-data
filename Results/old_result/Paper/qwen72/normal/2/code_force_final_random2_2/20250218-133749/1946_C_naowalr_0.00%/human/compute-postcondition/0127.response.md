Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `R - L` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `numCuts`, `x`, `R - L`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `leftover` is now the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is a specific value or result depending on the implementation of the `dfs` function.
