The code snippet `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the list `new` (starting from the second element) and comparing each element with its predecessor. If all comparisons are true, `new_all` will be `True`; otherwise, it will be `False`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user
- `i` is 1
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end
- The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `new_all`. The value of `new_all` will be `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
