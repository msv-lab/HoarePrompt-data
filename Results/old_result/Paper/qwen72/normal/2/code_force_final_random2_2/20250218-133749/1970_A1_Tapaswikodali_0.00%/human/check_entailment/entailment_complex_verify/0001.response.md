### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence up to each character. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - This is verified by the annotated code, which shows that the balance is updated correctly within the loop.

2. **Details Collection**:
   - The program collects the balance, negative index, and character in a list called `details`. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, ties in balance are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.
   - The annotated code confirms that the `details` list is populated with tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The annotated code shows that the `details` list is sorted correctly, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.
   - The annotated code confirms that the result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` directly from the standard input, which is appropriate for the given problem description.
   - The annotated code indicates that `s` is read correctly and is a non-empty, balanced parentheses sequence.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence, which is the expected output format.
   - The annotated code confirms that the final state of the program includes printing the transformed sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the steps required to produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
