Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `zero_perc` remains `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `i` is incremented by 1, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, and `lst` is updated to include `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. All other variables remain unchanged.**
