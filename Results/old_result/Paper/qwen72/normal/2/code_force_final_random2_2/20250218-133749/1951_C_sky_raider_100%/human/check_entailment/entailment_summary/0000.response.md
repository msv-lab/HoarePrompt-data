Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a daily purchase limit of `m` tickets and increasing prices after each purchase. The approach taken by the program involves sorting the list of ticket prices in ascending order and then purchasing tickets starting from the lowest available price, which is a greedy strategy. This ensures that the cost is minimized at each step.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.
3. **Sorting Prices**: The list of ticket prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because it allows the program to always choose the cheapest available tickets first.
4. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `t` (total tickets purchased so far), `s` (tickets to buy in the current iteration), and `c` (total cost).
5. **Iterating Over Days**: The program iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices. In each iteration:
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy in the current iteration, which is the minimum of `m` (daily limit) and `k` (remaining tickets needed).
   - It calculates the cost of buying these tickets and adds it to the total cost `c`.
   - It updates the total tickets purchased `t` and reduces the remaining tickets needed `k`.
6. **Printing the Result**: After processing all days, it prints the total cost `c`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases:
- It ensures that the number of tickets purchased in each day does not exceed the daily limit `m`.
- It correctly updates the total cost and the remaining tickets needed.
- The sorting step ensures that the program always buys the cheapest available tickets first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
