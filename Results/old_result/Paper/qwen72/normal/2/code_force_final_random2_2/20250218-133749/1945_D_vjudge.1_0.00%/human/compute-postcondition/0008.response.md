The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraint that `numero_testes` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the function's output or behavior is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the typical use of such a parameter in programming contexts, it might be inferred that the function could perform some operation a number of times defined by `numero_testes`. Since the actual output or return value is not provided, we can only state that the function likely operates based on the value of `numero_testes`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its specific return value or output is not defined in the provided information. It is implied that the function may operate based on a predefined variable `numero_testes`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.**
