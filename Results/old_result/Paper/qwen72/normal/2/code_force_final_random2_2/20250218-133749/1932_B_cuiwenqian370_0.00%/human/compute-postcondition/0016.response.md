Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[4]`, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `path` variable to the string at index 4 of the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `path` is now the string at `data[4]`.
