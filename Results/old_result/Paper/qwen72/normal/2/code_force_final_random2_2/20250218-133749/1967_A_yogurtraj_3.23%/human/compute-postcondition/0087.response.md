The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop iterates based on the value of `ii` and the range provided by the user input. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1, and the loop is set to iterate over a range defined by an integer input, which we'll call `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ii` is within the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is either `n - 1 - j` where `j` is the index at which the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is either `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or 0 if the condition was never met. If `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[j] + k // (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or the last element of `a` if the condition was never met, and `rem` is either `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or 0 if the condition was never met.**
