To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

This means the loop will execute if both of the following conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero (truthy).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Let's examine the current state:
- `i` is 3 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3 (not directly relevant to the loop condition but affects `n`).
- `k` must be a positive integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition but affects `cnt`).
- `cnt` is `k` (relevant to the loop condition).
- `l` is 1 (relevant to the loop condition).
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1` (relevant to the loop condition).
- `func_2()` must be less than `n` (not directly relevant to the loop condition).

Given the current state:
- `cnt` is `k`, and since `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is non-zero.
- `l` is 1, which is less than `n + 1` as long as `n` is at least 0.

Since `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is 1, the loop condition `cnt and l < n + 1` will be true as long as `n` is at least 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
