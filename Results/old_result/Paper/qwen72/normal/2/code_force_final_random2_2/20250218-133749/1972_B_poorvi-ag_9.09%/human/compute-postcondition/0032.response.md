Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is equal to the number of test cases provided initially.
- `i` is `t - 1`.
- `results` is a list containing at least one 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `t`:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. This is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is calculated as `t - 1`.
   - Since `t` is the number of test cases, `i` will be one less than the number of test cases.

3. **What will be printed:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `t - 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **t - 1 (where t is the number of test cases provided initially)**
