Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). `M` is a list containing the integer value of the square root of `q`, the integer `1`, the integer `3`, and if `q` is divisible by 2 and `q // 2` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains the value `q // 2`. Additionally, `M` now contains the value `q // i`. `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the additional integer `3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q // i` is calculated and appended to the list `M`.
- The value of `i` is 3, so `q // i` is `q // 3`.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
