Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `s[1]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[1]` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `s[1]` remains '0'. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0' and the rest correspond to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0, `s` contains 30 elements corresponding to the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[1]` is not equal to `s[2]`, or `s[1]` is not '1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the conditions regarding `flag` and the contents of `s` remain unchanged.***
