Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, and `j` is `2 * n`.**

Explanation: The code `dp = new_dp` updates the `dp` list to be the same as `new_dp`. All other variables (`n`, `p`, `offset`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. The `new_dp` list itself is not modified by this assignment, so it remains a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0.
