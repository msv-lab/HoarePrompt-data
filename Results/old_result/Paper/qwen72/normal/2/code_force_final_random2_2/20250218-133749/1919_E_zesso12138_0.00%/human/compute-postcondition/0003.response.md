Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a. The function `sys.stdin.read` is assigned to the variable `input`. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string. `index` is 0.**
