### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`. This is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost. This is correct and necessary for the algorithm.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`, it updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
   - If the current character `c` is 0:
     - It adds 1 to `ans` if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is correct because it accounts for the cost of moving a 1 past a 0.
   - If the current character `c` is 1:
     - It adds the difference between the total number of zeroes and the number of zeroes encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is correct because it accounts for the cost of moving all remaining 0s past the current 1.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`. This is the correct output format for the problem.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- The key idea is to count the number of 1s that need to be moved past 0s to achieve a sorted string.
- The program correctly handles the counting and updating of the cost based on the positions of 0s and 1s in the string.

### Verification:
- For the given example test cases:
  - "10" -> The cost is 2 because we can shift the entire string once.
  - "0000" -> The cost is 0 because the string is already sorted.
  - "11000" -> The cost is 9, which matches the optimal strategy described.
  - "101011" -> The cost is 5, which is correct.
  - "01101001" -> The cost is 11, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the described operations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
