The code `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `ans1` was initially an empty list. After the code executes, `ans1` contains the element `b[n - 1]`.
- The value of `b[n - 1]` is the element at index `n - 1` in the list `b`, which is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `ans2`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `ans1` is `[b[n - 1]]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are input integers.**
