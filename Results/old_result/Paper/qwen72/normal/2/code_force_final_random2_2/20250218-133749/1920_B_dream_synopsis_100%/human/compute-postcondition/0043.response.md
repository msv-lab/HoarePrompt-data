The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `x` is the third integer read from the input
- `a` is a reversed list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is equal to `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and the length of `ans` is `k + 1`
- The loop has executed one more time, and `t - 1` iterations remain

After executing the code:
- `a` is now a new list of integers read from the input, replacing the previous reversed list of integers.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the previous `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, and the length of `ans` is `k + 1`, and `t - 1` iterations remain.**
