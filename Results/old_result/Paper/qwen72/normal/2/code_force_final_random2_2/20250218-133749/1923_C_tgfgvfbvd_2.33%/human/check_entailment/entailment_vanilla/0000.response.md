### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `l`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the subarray sum using the prefix sums.
   - The subarray sum `s` for the range `[a, b]` is calculated as `p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise it is simply `p[b-1]`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The subarray is considered good if:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the subarray length is 1, which is not good by definition.
   - It also ensures that the sum of the subarray is sufficient to form a valid `b` array where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix sums ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
