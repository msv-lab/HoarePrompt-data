Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 1, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new string `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new string `a`. If `l` > `h`, the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`). Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
