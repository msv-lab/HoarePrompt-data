Let's break down the initial state and determine the output of the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variable `t`**:
   - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `t = abs(y_b - y_a + 1)`.
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `t = abs(y_b - y_a - 1)`.

2. **List `r`**:
   - `r` is a list of six integers: `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.

3. **Variables `n` and `m`**:
   - `n` is equal to `h`.
   - `m` is equal to `w`.

4. **Variables `x1` and `x2`**:
   - `x1` is equal to `x_a + 1 + a`.
   - `x2` is now equal to `x_b - a`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.

5. **Variables `y1` and `y2`**:
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - If `y1` >= `y2`:
     - `y1` is equal to `y_a - 1`.
     - `y2` remains `y_b`.
     - `a` is equal to `y_b - 1`.
   - If `y1` < `y2`:
     - `y1` is equal to `y_a + 1`.
     - `y2` remains `y_b`.
     - `a` is equal to `w - y_b`.

6. **Variable `b`**:
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.

7. **Additional Conditions**:
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis

- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition `x2 > x1` is explicitly stated.
  - The difference `x2 - x1` is an odd number.
  - The additional conditions state that either `x2 <= x1`, `x1 < 1`, or `x2 > n`. However, since `x2 > x1` is true, the only remaining conditions to check are `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

- **Values of `x1` and `x2`**:
  - `x1 = x_a + 1 + a`
  - `x2 = x_b - a`
  - Since `x2 > x1` and the difference is odd, these values are consistent with the given conditions.

- **Values of `y1` and `y2`**:
  - If `y1 >= y2`:
    - `y1 = y_a - 1`
    - `y2 = y_b`
    - `a = y_b - 1`
  - If `y1 < y2`:
    - `y1 = y_a + 1`
    - `y2 = y_b`
    - `a = w - y_b`

- **Value of `b`**:
  - `b = x2 - x1`
  - Since `x2 > x1` and the difference is odd, `b` is a positive odd number.

- **Final Condition**:
  - The additional conditions state that either `x2 <= x1`, `x1 < 1`, or `x2 > n`.
  - Since `x2 > x1` is true, the only remaining conditions to check are `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

Given the conditions and the fact that `x2 > x1` and the difference is odd, the only way the additional conditions can be satisfied is if `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

### Conclusion

The `print('draw')` statement will execute regardless of the specific values of `x1` and `x2` as long as the conditions are met. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **draw**
