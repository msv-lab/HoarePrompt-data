The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic and flow of the program align with the problem requirements, ensuring that the correct output is produced for each test case.
