Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenation of the first `x + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index `x` (if the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` was met), or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` (if the condition was never met), `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, `t` is set to `x` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
