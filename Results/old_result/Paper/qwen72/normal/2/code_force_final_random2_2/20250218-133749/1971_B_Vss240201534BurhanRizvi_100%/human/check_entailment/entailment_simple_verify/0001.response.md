### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Single Character String**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string. This is correct and matches the problem requirements.

3. **All Characters Are the Same**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program prints 'No' because it is impossible to rearrange such a string to form a different string. This is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string. However, the use of `random.sample` introduces a non-deterministic element, which means that in some rare cases, the generated permutation might still be the same as the original string `s`.

5. **Check for Equality**: After generating a random permutation `s2`, the program checks if `s2` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it modifies `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`. This is a good fallback mechanism to handle the rare case where the random permutation matches the original string.

6. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`. The output format is correct, and the program adheres to the problem statement's requirement that "YES" and "NO" can be in any case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling single-character strings and strings with all characters the same is correct.
- The use of `random.sample` to generate a random permutation is a valid approach.
- The check to ensure `s2` is different from `s` is necessary and correctly implemented.
- The program's output format is correct and meets the problem statement's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. The minor issue with case sensitivity in the output ('No' and 'Yes') is not a correctness issue but a minor formatting issue that does not affect the program's functionality.

Final: **True**
