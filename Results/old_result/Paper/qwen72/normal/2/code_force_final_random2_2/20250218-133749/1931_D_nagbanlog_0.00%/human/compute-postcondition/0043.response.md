Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is still a list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is still an empty list, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the iteration, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by `x` and has the same remainder when divided by `y` as the original number. The specific values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer relevant as they were used during the loop but are not retained after the loop completes.**
