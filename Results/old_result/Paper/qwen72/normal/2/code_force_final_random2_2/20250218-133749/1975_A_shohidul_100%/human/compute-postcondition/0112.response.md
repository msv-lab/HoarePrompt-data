The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the condition, the most internal loop or if statement is exited if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.**
