Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2, and `x` is `n`. If the second element of `l` (`l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (`l[0]`), `b` is updated to the second element of `l` (`l[1]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` remains 0.***
