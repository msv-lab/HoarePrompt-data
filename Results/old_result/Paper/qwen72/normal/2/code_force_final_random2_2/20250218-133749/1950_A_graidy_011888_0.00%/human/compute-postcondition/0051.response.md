Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, i is 6, x is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), y is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), z is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If x < y, then if y > z, res is 'peak'; if y < z, res is 'stair'; if y == z, res is 'none'. If x >= y, res is 'none'.**
