Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can score in the card game by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key insight is that you can only score a point if you play a card that has already been played by either you or Nene. Therefore, the strategy is to count how many cards in your hand have duplicates, because only those can potentially give you points.

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and counts the occurrences of each card in your hand. It then calculates the number of points you can score by adding `max(0, x - 1)` for each card type `x`, which effectively counts the number of duplicates (since a card can only score a point if it has a duplicate).

However, the program does not explicitly consider Nene's optimal play, but it implicitly handles it by focusing on the duplicates in your hand. Since Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the only way you can score points is by having duplicates in your hand that Nene hasn't played yet.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the game, the program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can score by counting the duplicates in your hand, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
