Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, if `r` is '>', `prev` is 2, otherwise `prev` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the user input to the variable `r`. The value of `r` is now the user input. If the user input is '>', then `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0. All other variables (`t`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`) retain their initial values.
