Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. The program then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic aligns with the requirement to determine which character appears more frequently in each string.

The program also handles the constraints specified in the problem, such as the length of the string being exactly 5 and the number of test cases being between 1 and 32. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the expected output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
