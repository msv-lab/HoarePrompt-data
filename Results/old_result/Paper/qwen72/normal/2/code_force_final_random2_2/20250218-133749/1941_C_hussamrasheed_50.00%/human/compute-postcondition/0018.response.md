Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `m = s.count('map')` updates the value of `m` to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
