Output State: **`i` is `k-2`, `t` is `(t * (2 ** (k-1))) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + (t * (2 ** (k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `k-2`:** After the loop completes, `i` will have been incremented `k-1` times starting from `k-2`, so it will end up being `k-2`.
- **`t` is `(t * (2 ** (k-1))) % MOD`:** The variable `t` is doubled and taken modulo `MOD` in each iteration. After `k-1` iterations, `t` will be multiplied by `2` raised to the power of `k-1` and then taken modulo `MOD`.
- **`ans` is `(ans + (t * (2 ** (k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`:** The variable `ans` is updated by adding `t` in each iteration, which means it accumulates the sum of `t` over all iterations. Since `t` is doubled in each iteration, the total addition to `ans` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: `t + 2*t + 4*t + ... + (2**(k-2))*t`. This sum can be simplified to `t * (2**(k-1) - 1)`, and then taken modulo `MOD`. Finally, the result is added to the initial value of `ans` and taken modulo `MOD` again.
