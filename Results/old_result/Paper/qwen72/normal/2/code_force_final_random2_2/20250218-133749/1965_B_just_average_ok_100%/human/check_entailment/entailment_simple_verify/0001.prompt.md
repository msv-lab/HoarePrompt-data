You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the list `nums` will contain the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the values \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\). The variable `idx` will be the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`. The variable `i` will be the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists. The length of `nums` will be 23. The values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the input values for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program starts by generating powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (i.e., `1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576`).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It appends three additional numbers: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the list itself.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Powers of 2:** The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which ensures that any subset sum of these numbers is unique and can represent any number in the range `[1, 2^21 - 1]` using binary representation.
   - **Removing a Power of 2:** By removing the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because the removed number is crucial for forming the sum `k` when combined with other smaller powers of 2.
   - **Adding Additional Numbers:**
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed, as the removed power of 2 is necessary to form this sum.
     - `k + 1`: This number ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary for the range `[1, n]`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This number ensures that the sum `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed, which helps in covering the range `[1, n]` more effectively.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by removing a critical element.
   - The added elements help cover the required range `[1, n]` while avoiding the sum `k`.
   - The size of the sequence is at most 25, which meets the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other required sums in the range `[1, n]`.
