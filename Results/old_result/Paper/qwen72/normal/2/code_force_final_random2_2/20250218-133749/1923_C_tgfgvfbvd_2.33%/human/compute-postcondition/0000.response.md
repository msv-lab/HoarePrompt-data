To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop, and its value is not important for the loop's execution.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to run at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- `l_i` and `r_i` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is a positive integer. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we can assume that the input will be a valid positive integer within this range.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which is already guaranteed by the constraints of `t`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 10^4)**
