To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the value from `range(n)` is not being used within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case
- The sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is not something we need to adjust, as it is just a placeholder.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, s_i ∈ {0, 1}) for each test case, the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0**
