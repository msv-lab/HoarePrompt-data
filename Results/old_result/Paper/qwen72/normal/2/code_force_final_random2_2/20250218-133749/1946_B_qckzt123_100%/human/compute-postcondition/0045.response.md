The provided Python code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, converting the list of strings into a list of integers. This new list of integers is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`. The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` and `k` are the input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-2) * t) % MOD` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `k-2`.**
