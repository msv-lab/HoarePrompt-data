Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`r`**: A list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` where:
   - \(1 \leq x_a, x_b \leq h \leq 10^6\)
   - \(1 \leq y_a, y_b \leq w \leq 10^9\)
   - Either \(x_a \neq x_b\) or \(y_a \neq y_b\)
3. **`n`**: Equal to `h`.
4. **`m`**: Equal to `w`.
5. **`x1`**: Equal to `x_a + a`, where:
   - `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`
   - `a` is `w - y1` if `y2 < y1`
6. **`y1`**: Equal to `y_a`.
7. **`x2`**: Equal to `x_b - a`.
8. **`y2`**: Equal to `y_b`.
9. **`x2` is greater than `x1`**.
10. **The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even**.
11. **`y1` is not equal to `y2`**.
12. **`b`**: Equal to `x2 - x1`.
13. **The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`**.

### Analysis:
- The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is explicitly stated, but the final condition states that the current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`. This creates a contradiction because if `x2` is greater than `x1`, it cannot be less than or equal to `x1`.

Given this contradiction, the code will not execute under normal conditions because the conditions cannot be simultaneously true. However, since the `print('draw')` statement is present, it will still execute regardless of the logical inconsistency in the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
