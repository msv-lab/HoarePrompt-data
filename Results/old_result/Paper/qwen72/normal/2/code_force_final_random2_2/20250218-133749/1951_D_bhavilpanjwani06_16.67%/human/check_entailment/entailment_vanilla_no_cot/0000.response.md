Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not always provide a valid setup of stalls and prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of `n == k` Case**: When `n == k`, the solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with the price equal to `n`. However, this is a specific case and does not cover all scenarios where a solution exists.

2. **Handling of General Case**: The general case logic is flawed. The condition `if k - 1 < n - k + 1` is used to decide whether to set up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This logic is not sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the solution sets up two stalls with prices `5` and `1`, but Alice would only buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 2 jewels, which is incorrect.

3. **General Solution Strategy**: A more robust approach is needed to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to set up `k` stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels. This can be achieved by setting the prices in a way that ensures Alice spends just enough coins to buy one jewel from each stall.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        prices = [n // k] * k
        remainder = n % k
        for i in range(remainder):
            prices[i] += 1
        print(*prices)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up `k` stalls with appropriate prices. If `n` is divisible by `k`, each stall will have the same price. Otherwise, the remainder is distributed among the first few stalls to ensure the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.
