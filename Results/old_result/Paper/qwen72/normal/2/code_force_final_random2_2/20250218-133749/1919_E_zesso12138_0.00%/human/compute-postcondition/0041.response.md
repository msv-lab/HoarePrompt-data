Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, `j` is 3, and `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 3. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[4]` is updated to `(new_dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD`.***
