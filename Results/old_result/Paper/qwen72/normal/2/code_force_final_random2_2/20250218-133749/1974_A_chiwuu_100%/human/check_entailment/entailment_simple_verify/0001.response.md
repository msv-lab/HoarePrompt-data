### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. The calculation `t = b // 2 + (b % 2 != 0)` is correct. This ensures that we account for any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen. For example, if `b = 5`, then `t = 3` because 5 // 2 = 2 and 5 % 2 = 1, so 2 + 1 = 3.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons. The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. So, the total number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons is calculated correctly.

4. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`a`), the program does not need to add more screens.
   - If the remaining space is insufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `t2 = a - t1` computes the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, and `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 != 0)` ensures that we account for any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen. This is correct because `t2 // 15` gives the number of full screens needed, and `(t2 % 15 != 0)` adds one more screen if there are any remaining icons.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `a` or `b` are zero correctly.
- **Screen Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is correct.
- **Additional Screens**: The logic for adding additional screens for remaining 1x1 icons is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the necessary calculations and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
