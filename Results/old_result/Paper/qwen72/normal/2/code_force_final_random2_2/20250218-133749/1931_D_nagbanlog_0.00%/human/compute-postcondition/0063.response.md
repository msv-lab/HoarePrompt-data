Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary. If the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is set to 0, and `beautiful_count` remains 0. If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is updated to the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0.***
