Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`.
- `i` is set to `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`el`, `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`.
