Reasoning:  
The program provided does generate the correct checkerboard patterns for the specific values of \( n \) (1, 2, 3, 4) as described in the problem statement. However, the program fails to handle the general case where \( n \) can be any integer between 1 and 20. Instead of providing a solution that works for all valid \( n \), the program uses hard-coded outputs for \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) and prints an error message for any other value of \( n \). This does not meet the requirements of the problem, which states that the program should work for any \( n \) within the specified range.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where \( n \) is outside the range [1, 20] correctly. The problem specifies that \( n \) will always be within this range, so the "No esta en el rango" message is unnecessary and incorrect.

To be correct, the program should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) in the range [1, 20].

Correctness: **False**
