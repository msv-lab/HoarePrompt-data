The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of coins Alice has and `k` represents the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. The function checks if Alice can buy the required number of jewels based on the following conditions: If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `(n - k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output printed.
