The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.

Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, this condition is satisfied, and no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, but since `n` is already within the required range, we only need to specify the initial value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
