Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with the final `k` elements added and the smallest elements removed as necessary, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is now an empty list, `current_profit` is the final calculated profit after processing all items in `combined`, `k` is 0, `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to process items from `combined` until `combined` is empty.
- For each iteration, the last tuple (`item`) is popped from `combined`.
- Depending on the sum of the elements in `item`, `current_profit` is adjusted accordingly.
- The `heap` is updated by pushing the new `item` and popping the smallest element, if any.
- If the updated `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated.
- After all iterations, `combined` is empty, and `heap` contains the final `k` elements processed.
- `current_profit` reflects the profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the highest profit observed during the loop execution.
