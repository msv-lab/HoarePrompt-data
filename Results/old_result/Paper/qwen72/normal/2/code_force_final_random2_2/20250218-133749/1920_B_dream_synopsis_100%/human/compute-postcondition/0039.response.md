Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `k + 1`, which is the condition that causes the loop to terminate. The list `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
