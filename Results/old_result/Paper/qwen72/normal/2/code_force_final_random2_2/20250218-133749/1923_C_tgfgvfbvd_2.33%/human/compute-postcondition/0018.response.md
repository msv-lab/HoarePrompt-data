Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, and `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0.**
