Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is 2 (if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `j` remains 1), `count` is 2 (or 3 if the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`), and `flag` is True if the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1'. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `j` is incremented by 1.***
