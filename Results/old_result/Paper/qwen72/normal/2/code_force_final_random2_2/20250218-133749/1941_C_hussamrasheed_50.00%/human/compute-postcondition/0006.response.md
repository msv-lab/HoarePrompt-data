The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The initial state provides that `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, and `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.

Since the code only affects the variable `p`, the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
