The value of `pref` is updated by adding the second element of `lista_A` (since `i` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers read from the input, `pref` is now the sum of the first element of `lista_A` and the second element of `lista_A`, `soma_b` is the first element of `lista_B` if the first element of `lista_A` was not less than the first element of `lista_B`, otherwise `soma_b` is 0.**
