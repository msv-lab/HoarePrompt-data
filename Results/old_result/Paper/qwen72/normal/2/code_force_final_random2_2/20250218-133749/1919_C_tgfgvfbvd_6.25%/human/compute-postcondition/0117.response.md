Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0), `c` is 0 or 1, `y` is the index of the element where the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was met (or `n-1` if no such element exists), `x` is `y + 1`, and `y + 1` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` otherwise. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, and the following updates occur: if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`; if `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
