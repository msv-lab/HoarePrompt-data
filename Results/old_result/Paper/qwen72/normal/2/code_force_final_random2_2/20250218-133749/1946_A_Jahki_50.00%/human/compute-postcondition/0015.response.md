The code snippet `ma = int(num2 / 2)` divides `num2` by 2 and assigns the integer part of the result to `ma`. Given that `num2` is an odd integer and is less than or equal to 10000, dividing an odd number by 2 will always result in a non-integer, and taking the integer part of this division will effectively floor the result.

For example, if `num2` is 9 (an odd number), `int(9 / 2)` results in `4`.

Therefore, the value of `ma` will be `num2 // 2`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `num2 / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `num2` is odd, `ma` is `num2 // 2`.**
