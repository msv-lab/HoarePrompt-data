Postcondition: **`k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\), `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.** 

This means that after entering the if condition, all the initial conditions specified in the precondition still hold true, and additionally, the value of `j` (which is 0) is not equal to the value of `i` (the largest integer such that \(1 << i \leq k\)).
