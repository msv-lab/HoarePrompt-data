The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop's continuation is solely dependent on the value of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's condition, it does not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0, but it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**
