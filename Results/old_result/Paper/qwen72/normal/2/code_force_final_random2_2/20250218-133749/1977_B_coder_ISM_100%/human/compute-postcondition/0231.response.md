Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. Additionally, the second element of `s` (i.e., `s[1]`) is `'-1'`, and the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is `'1'`.**
