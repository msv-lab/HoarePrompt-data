### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. This is essential for processing multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input, which is appropriate for the problem.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible, and the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

4. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with the price equal to `n`. The program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (n). This is correct because Alice will buy exactly one jewel from the single stall, spending all her coins.

5. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - If this condition is true, the program prints "YES", followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices (`n - k + 1` and 1). This is correct because:
     - Alice will buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins.
     - She will have `k - 1` coins left, which is exactly enough to buy 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints "NO". This is correct because it means there is no way to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the base cases where `n < k` and `n == k`.
- For the case where `n > k`, the program uses a greedy approach to check if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This approach is valid because:
  - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - If `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, it is not possible to set up two stalls to achieve the desired result, so the program prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
