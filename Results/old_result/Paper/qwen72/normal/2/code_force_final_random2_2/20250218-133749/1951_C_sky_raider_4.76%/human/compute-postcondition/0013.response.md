Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - s` (which means `k` is now `k - min(m, k)`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `k` remains `k - s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged.
