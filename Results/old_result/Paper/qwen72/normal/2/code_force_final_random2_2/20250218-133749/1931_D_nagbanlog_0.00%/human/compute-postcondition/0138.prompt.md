You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a. For each tuple, n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x and y are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing `t` tuples, `case` is the last tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case, `n` is the first value from the last `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from the last `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from the last `case['params']`, `a` is the array from the last `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the modulus results of each element in the last `a` with `x` and `y`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appears in the last `a`. `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in the last `a`, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`. The variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in the last `a`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in each `a` array, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs in the corresponding list `a`. A "beautiful" pair `(a[i], a[j])` is defined as a pair where `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in each `a` array, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.
