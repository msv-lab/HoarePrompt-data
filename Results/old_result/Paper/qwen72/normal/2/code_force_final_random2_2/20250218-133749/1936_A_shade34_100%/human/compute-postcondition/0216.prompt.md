Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `pans` will contain all indices `i` for which the user input was "=" or "<", and `s` will be the last user input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the current user input is '>' or not, `s` is the last user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the current user input is '>', `mak` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the last user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 depending on the previous user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the last user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2 or 0/1 depending on the previous state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
