Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, considering the increase in friendship value for subsequent excursions if a pair is chosen again. The key part of the solution is in the calculation of the expected value, which is done in `func_1`.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
- **Logic**:
  - The function iterates over each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)`.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the expected value using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the cumulative increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions.
  - The result is accumulated in the variable `result`.
- **Output**: The final result is returned modulo `MOD`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` is used to calculate the contribution of each friendship to the expected value. However, this formula assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each excursion, which is not correct.
   - The correct approach should consider the probability of selecting a specific pair of friends in each excursion and the cumulative effect of these selections over `k` excursions.

2. **Probability Consideration**:
   - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The expected value of the friendship value for a specific pair after `k` excursions is `f * (1 - (1 - 1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2))^k)`.
   - The total expected value is the sum of these expected values for all pairs of friends.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly account for the probability of selecting a specific pair of friends and the cumulative effect of these selections over `k` excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
