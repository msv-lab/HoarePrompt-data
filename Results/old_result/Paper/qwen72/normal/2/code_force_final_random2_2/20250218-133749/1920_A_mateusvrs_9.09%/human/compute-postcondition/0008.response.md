Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new values assigned to `a` and `x` based on the user input.
