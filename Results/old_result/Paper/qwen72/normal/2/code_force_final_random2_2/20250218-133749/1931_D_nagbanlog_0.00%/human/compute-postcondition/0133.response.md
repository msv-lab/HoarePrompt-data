To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples.
   - `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0.
   - `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and its value is the count of how many times the corresponding `mod_x` and `mod_y` occurred in the list `a`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that the sum of their required modifications to `x` and `y` results in a pair that exists in `freq`.
   - `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in the list `a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string "Beautiful pairs count: " followed by the value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `beautiful_count` is described as the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that the sum of their required modifications to `x` and `y` results in a pair that exists in `freq`.

Given the initial state, the value of `beautiful_count` is determined by the logic that processes the list `a` and the dictionary `freq`. Since the exact values of `a` and `freq` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `beautiful_count`. However, we know that it represents the count of valid pairs as described.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that the sum of their required modifications to `x` and `y` results in a pair that exists in `freq`)**
