Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level, and calculates the number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement for holding `m` rounds. The function `func_1` accurately computes the minimum number of new problems required by checking how many of each difficulty level are missing to reach the required number `m`. The solution handles all constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
