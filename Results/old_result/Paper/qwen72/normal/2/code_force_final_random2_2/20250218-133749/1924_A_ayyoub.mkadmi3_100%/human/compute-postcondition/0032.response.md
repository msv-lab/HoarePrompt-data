The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`. `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26. The function returns a tuple containing three elements:
- A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
- A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
- The value of `s2`, which is either the last character of `s` if it was the only remaining character in the alphabet when the loop reached it, or an empty string otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s`, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and a string `s2` which is either the last character of `s` or an empty string.**
