The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, `f` are input integers.**
