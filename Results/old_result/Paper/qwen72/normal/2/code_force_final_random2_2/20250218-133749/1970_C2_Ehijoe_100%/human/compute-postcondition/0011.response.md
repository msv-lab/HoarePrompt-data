The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the integer `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
- `t` is an input integer
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list
- `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is True
- `i` is 1
- `u` and `v` are input integers
- `nodes[u]` contains the list [v, v]
- `nodes[v]` contains the list [u]

After executing the code snippet:
- `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u, u]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` contains the list [v, v], `nodes[v]` contains the list [u, u]**.
