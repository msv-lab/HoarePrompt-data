To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `k` is the second integer from input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`.
- `i` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k`.
- `permutation` has been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `k`.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter and is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`, `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + ((len(permutation) - 1) // k) * k`, and `permutation` has been updated such that for each index `j` starting from 1 and increasing by `k`, `permutation[j]` is set to `n // k + 1 + j // k`.**
