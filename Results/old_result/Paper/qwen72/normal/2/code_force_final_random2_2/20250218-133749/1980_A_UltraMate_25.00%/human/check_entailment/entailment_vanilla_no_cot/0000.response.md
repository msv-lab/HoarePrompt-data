Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided is almost correct but has a minor issue. The string `p` used to check the presence and count of problems of each difficulty level only includes 'ABCDEF', missing the 'G'. This means that the program will not correctly account for the 'G' difficulty problems, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the string `p` should include all the difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G':

```python
p = 'ABCDEFG'
```

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            else:
                if hmp[i] < m:
                    ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases.
