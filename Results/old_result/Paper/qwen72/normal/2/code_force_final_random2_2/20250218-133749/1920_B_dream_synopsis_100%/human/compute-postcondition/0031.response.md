Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` calculates the new value of `sums`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x]` is a slice of the list `a` from the start up to (but not including) the index `x`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the elements in this slice.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` multiplies this sum by 2.
- `sums` is then set to `sum1` minus this doubled sum.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged, and their conditions still hold true.
