The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n // k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n // k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it's a for loop), making `i` 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n // k + 1`. Therefore, `n // k` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`cnt`, `l`, `func_2()`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop's continuation condition directly. However, they remain part of the overall state.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
