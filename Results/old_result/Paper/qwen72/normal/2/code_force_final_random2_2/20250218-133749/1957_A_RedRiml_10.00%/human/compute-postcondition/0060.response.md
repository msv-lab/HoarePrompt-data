Postcondition: ***`palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` is added to the list `pl`. If `i` is already in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1, and `i` remains in the list `pl`.***
