The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is some value (let's call it `x`). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `x + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i + 1`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i + 1`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i`** 

However, to strictly adhere to the instruction that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, the correct adjustment would be:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.**
