Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and now sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `t` iterations remain. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
