Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` is 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, and `a` and `x` are no longer relevant. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements `[1000000008, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `bx` is updated to -1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `bx` is now -1, which is less than `ax` (1000000007), the list `r` will contain `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`.
