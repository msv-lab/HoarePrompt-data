Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` remains greater than 0, `ap` remains greater than 0, `k` remains 0, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the new `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of the new `x / 15`. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, then `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. In all other cases, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that (`x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0).***
