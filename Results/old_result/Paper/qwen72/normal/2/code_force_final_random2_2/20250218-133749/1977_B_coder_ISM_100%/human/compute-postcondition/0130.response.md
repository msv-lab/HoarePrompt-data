Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first, `s[2]` is '1', `flag` is 0, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and in all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.**
