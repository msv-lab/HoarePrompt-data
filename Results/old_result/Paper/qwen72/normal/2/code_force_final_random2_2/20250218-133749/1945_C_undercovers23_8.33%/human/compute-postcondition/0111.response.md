Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0.
- **`_`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: The input integer remains unchanged.
- **`s`**: The input string remains unchanged.
- **`pk`**: The value of `n // 2` remains unchanged.
- **`sl`**: The list of characters from `s` remains unchanged.
- **`o`**: The count of '1's in `s` remains unchanged.
- **`z`**: The count of '0's in `s` remains unchanged.
- **`mini`**: Remains 100,000,000.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` is `n - 1`.
- **`zero`**: The total number of '0's in `s` after the loop.
- **`one`**: The total number of '1's in `s` after the loop.
- **`zero_perc`**: The percentage of '0's in the first `i + 1` characters of `s` after the loop.
- **`one_perc`**: The percentage of '1's in the remaining characters of `s` after the loop.
- **`lst`**: A list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
- **`final`**: A sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.
