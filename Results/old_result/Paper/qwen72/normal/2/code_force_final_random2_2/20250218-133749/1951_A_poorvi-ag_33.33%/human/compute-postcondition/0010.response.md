Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string containing exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the strings 'no', 'no'.** 

The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contained the string 'no', after the execution, `results` now contains two 'no' strings. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
