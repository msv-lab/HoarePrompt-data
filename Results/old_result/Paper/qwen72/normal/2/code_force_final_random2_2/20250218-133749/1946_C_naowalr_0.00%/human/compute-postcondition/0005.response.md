Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`) remain unchanged.
