Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1.
   - `k` must be greater than 2.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` is less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is less than `n`, `l` will be a value between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is used in the expression `i * v`, which simplifies to `v` since `i` is 1.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? {l} {i * v}`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `{l}` will be `func_2() + 1`.
     - `{i * v}` will be `v` since `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [v] (where [func_2() + 1] is the value of `l` and [v] is the value of `v`)**
