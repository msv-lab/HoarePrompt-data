Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). The function should handle up to 100 test cases. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each including a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string. If `n` is even, `results` contains a single 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` contains 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, otherwise `results` contains 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. If `n % 2 == 0`, `results` is appended with an additional 'no'. Otherwise, if `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')`, `results` is appended with 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` is appended with 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing either 'yes', 'no', or a single 'no'. If `n % 2 == 0`, `results` is appended with an additional 'no'. Otherwise, if `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')`, `results` is appended with 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` is appended with 'no'. `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
