Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. In both cases, `l[x]` is greater than the new values of `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged. If `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`, and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains unchanged.***
