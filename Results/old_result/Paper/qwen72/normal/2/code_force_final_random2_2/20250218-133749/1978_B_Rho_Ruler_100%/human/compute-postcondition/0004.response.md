Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is calculated as `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`.
- The function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` is called with `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as arguments, and the result is stored in `profit_mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged.
