The function `func_1` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user. For each set, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. Based on the count and the presence of the substring '11', it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 2 or less and '11' is not in the string. It prints 'NO' in all other cases. After processing all sets of inputs, the function ends without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the last values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` as described in the annotations.
