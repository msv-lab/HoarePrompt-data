Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0. If `x` == 0 and `y` > 0, then `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Otherwise, if `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, then `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. In all other cases, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that (`x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0).***
