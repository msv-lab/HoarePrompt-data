Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is \(n - 1\).
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is \(n - 1\).
- `r` is the user input.
- `prev` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`v1`**: This variable is defined as \(n - 1\). Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `v1` will be \(n - 1\).
2. **`i`**: This variable is explicitly set to 1.
3. **`prev`**: This variable is explicitly set to 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- `v1` is \(n - 1\).
- `i` is 1.
- `prev` is 0.

### Constructing the Output:
The print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```
Substituting the values:
```python
print(f'? {n-1} {1} {n-1} {0}')
```

### Final Output:
The output will be a string where `v1` is replaced by \(n - 1\), `i` is replaced by 1, and `prev` is replaced by 0.

Output: **? n-1 1 n-1 0 (where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2)**
