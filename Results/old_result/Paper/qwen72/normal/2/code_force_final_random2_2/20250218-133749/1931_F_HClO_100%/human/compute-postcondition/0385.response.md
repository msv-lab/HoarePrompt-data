Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes two integers, n and k, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. For each of the k participants who posted a screenshot, the function receives n distinct integers indicating the order of participants shown to the author of the screenshot. The function returns the processed results for each test case, likely determining some property or relationship among the participants based on the given orders.**
