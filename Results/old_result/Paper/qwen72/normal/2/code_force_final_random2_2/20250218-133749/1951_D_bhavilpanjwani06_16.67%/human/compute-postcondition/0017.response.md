Postcondition: ***t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. If n < k, the current value of n is less than k. If n ≥ k, then either n is exactly equal to k, or n is greater than k, and the relationship between n and k can be either \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) or \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \).***
