The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a non-negative integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It calculates the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers in `nums` and subtracts the sum of every second element starting from the first element of a sorted list of zero counts in each number in `nums` (in descending order). If the result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, the function returns 'Sasha'; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
