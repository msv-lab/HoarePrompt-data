Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `path` is the string at `data[4]`, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` twice.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list, which already contains one result from `func_1(path)`. Therefore, `results` now contains two results from `func_1(path)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
