Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is 1.
- `r` is the final user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop.
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` are explicitly given in the initial state:
  - `v1` is 0.
  - `v2` is 1.

### Output Calculation:
- The f-string `f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'` will substitute the values of `v1` and `v2` into the string.
- Substituting `v1 = 0` and `v2 = 1` into the string, we get:
  - `? 0 0 1 1`

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
