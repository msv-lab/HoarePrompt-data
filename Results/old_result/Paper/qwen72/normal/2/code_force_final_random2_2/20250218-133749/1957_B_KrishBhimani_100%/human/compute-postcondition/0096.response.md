The code snippet `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. To determine the new state, let's break down the calculation:

- `ans` initially contains the value \(2^i - 1\).
- `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the elements in `ans`.
- `k - sum(ans)` computes the difference between `k` and the sum of the elements in `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list containing the value \(2^i - 1\).
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as `[2^i - 1]`.

The sum of `ans` is:
\[ \text{sum(ans)} = 2^i - 1 \]

So, the value being appended to `ans` is:
\[ k - (2^i - 1) = k - 2^i + 1 \]

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be:
\[ ans = [2^i - 1, k - 2^i + 1] \]

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2^i - 1\) and \(k - 2^i + 1\), `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.**
