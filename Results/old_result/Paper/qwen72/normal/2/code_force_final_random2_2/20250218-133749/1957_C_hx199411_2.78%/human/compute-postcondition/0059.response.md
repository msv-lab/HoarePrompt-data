To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- `m` is `n`.
- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if the condition is checked in the if part, and `num` is 4 if the condition is checked in the else part.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `r`, `m`, `num`) are not directly involved in the loop head condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `k` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `m` is `n`. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3 if the condition is checked in the if part, and `num` is 4 if the condition is checked in the else part.**
