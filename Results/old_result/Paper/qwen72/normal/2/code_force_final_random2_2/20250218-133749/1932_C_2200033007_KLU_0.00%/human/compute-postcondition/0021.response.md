Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, if `s[i] == 'L'`, `b` now includes the element `a[l-1]` as its second-to-last element and `a[r]` as its last element, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]` followed by `a[r]`, and `r` is decremented by 2.**
