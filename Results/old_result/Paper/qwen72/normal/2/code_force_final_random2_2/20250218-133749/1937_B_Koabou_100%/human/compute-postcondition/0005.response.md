The code appends an input to the list `a` two times. Since the loop will execute 2 times, two new inputs will be added to the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` contains two input strings, so after executing the code, `a` will contain four strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing four input strings.**
