The function `func_1` checks if there is a path from the `start` node to any other node in the tree (represented by the `nodes` dictionary) that avoids the `parent` node. It returns `True` if such a path exists, meaning at least one adjacent node of `start` (excluding the `parent` node) can reach another node satisfying the condition `not func_1(nodes, node, start)`. If no such path exists, it returns `False`. The function effectively determines if the `start` node is part of a connected component in the tree that includes more than just itself and its direct parent.
