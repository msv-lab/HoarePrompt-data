### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of the set should be maximized.

2. **Approach**:
   - The key insight is that the GCD of the set of integers must be a divisor of `x`.
   - We need to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form a valid set of `n` integers whose sum is `x`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `n`.
   - We iterate over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (since divisors come in pairs).
   - For each divisor `i`, we check if `x % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, we check if we can form `n` integers with GCD `i`:
     - If `n <= x // i`, then `i` is a valid GCD.
     - If `n <= i`, then `x // i` is a valid GCD.
   - We keep track of the maximum valid GCD found.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads `x` and `n` from input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` is a valid GCD and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `n` is greater than `x` by checking both `n <= x // i` and `n <= i`.
   - The code correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number (only 1 and `x` are divisors).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The code efficiently checks divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is optimal for the given constraints.

7. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The loop iterates over potential divisors up to the square root of `x`, ensuring efficiency.
   - The conditions inside the loop correctly check if the current divisor can form a valid set of `n` integers.
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which is the maximum GCD found.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of a set of `n` integers whose sum is `x`. It handles all edge cases and efficiently finds the solution.

Final: **True**
