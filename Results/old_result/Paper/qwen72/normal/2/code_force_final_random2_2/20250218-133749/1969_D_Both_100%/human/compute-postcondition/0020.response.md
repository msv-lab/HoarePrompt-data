Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined` (previously the last element of `combined`) if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the tuple with the highest bonus value, and `k` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined` has been added to `heap`.**
