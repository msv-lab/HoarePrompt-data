To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant details:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `len(l) - 1` after the loop executes all iterations.
   - `l` contains all its original elements.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once.
   - `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - len(l)`, where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop.
   - `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended once.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once.
   - The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print these elements separated by spaces.

Given this information, the output of the `print(*ans1)` statement will be the elements of `l` printed in the same order they appear in `l`.

Output: **[elements of l separated by spaces]** (where the elements are the original elements of the list `l`)

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3 4**
