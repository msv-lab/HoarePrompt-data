You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9; all pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct; the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the input integers for the last test case, `k` is the input integer for the last test case, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations for the last test case, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration of the last test case, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2` for the last test case, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd` for the last test case, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd` for the last test case, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It processes these parameters and returns results based on the specified constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
