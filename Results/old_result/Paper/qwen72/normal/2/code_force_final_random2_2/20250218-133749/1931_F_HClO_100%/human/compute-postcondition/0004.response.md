The `input()` function waits for user input and returns it as a string. However, since the input is not assigned to any variable, the input itself does not affect the state of the program. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1.**
