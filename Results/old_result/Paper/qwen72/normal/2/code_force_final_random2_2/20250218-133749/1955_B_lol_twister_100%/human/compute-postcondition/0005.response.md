The only objects in the loop head are the variables `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is 0, `h` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than the new value of `h`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is 0, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
