Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is `mid` + 1; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (0 + min(`n`, `b`)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. Additionally, the current value of `profit_next` is greater than the current value of `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid` + 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `low` is now `mid` + 1, which means the search range has shifted to a higher interval. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
