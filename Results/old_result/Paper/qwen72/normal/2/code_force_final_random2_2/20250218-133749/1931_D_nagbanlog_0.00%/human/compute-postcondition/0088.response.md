Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
- `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is 0.
- `n` is the first value from `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second value from `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third value from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over.
- `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the modulus results of each element in `a` with `x` and `y`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appears in `a`.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in `a`, where a "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in the array `a`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in the array `a`)**
