Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, `j` is 3, `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 3, `new_dp[4]` is updated to `(new_dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` using the formula `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Given that `j` is 3, the index `j + 1` is 4.
- The value of `new_dp[4]` is updated to the result of `(new_dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
