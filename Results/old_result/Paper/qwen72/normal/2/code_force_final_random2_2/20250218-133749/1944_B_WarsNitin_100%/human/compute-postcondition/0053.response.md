Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and the other conditions (`ans1`, `k`, `l`, etc.) remain unchanged. If `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 3 and 2 of `b`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[3]` does not equal `b[2]`, `l` now includes the element `b[3]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
