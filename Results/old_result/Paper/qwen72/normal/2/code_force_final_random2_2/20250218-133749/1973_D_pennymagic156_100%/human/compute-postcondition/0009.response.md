To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.
- `i` is `n`.
- If `v` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - If `v` is equal to `n`, the loop breaks.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 because the loop is iterating in reverse order from `n` to 1.
- **`n`**: `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 1` and `n` should remain the same. The state of `v` and the condition for breaking the loop do not affect the loop head variables directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `i` is `n - 1`**.
