Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string formed by shifting the characters of `s` one position to the left, with the first character moved to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains as a shuffled version of `s`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
