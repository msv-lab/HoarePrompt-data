The provided Python code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is given as `n - 3`, the element `a1` will be inserted at the index `n - 3` in the list `l1`.

However, the initial state does not specify the contents of `l1` or the value of `a1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new content of `l1` after the insertion. However, we can state that the length of `l1` will increase by 1, and the element `a1` will be placed at the index `n - 3`.

The other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `val`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is an empty list, and `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n - 3`.**
