Postcondition: ***`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`. If `tmp` (which is initially `x`) is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
