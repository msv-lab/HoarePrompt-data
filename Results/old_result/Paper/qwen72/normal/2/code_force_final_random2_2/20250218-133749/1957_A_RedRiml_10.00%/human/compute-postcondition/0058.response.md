Postcondition: ***`palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`. If `d.get(i) == None`, `d` contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}` and `i` is added to the list `pl` if it was not already in `pl`. If `d.get(i) != None`, `i` is in the list `pl`, and `d` contains the key `i` with its value increased by 1.***
