Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an input integer, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v].** 

Explanation: The code appends the integer `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. Since `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory set to list, if `u` was not previously a key in `nodes`, it is automatically created with an empty list, and `v` is appended to this list. All other variables remain unchanged.
