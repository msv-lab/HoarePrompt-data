Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k)`, `l` is the same as initially, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`.**

Explanation:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the new input integers provided by `input().split()`.
- `i` remains the same as `n` (which is now the new input integer).
- `k` is updated to `k - n * min(m, k)`, using the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- `s` is updated to the minimum of the new `m` and `k`.
- `c` is updated to the expression `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, using the new values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and the existing list `l`.
- `t` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
