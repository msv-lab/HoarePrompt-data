You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the last input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. The function calculates the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` and subtracts 1 if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1'. The result for each test case is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the minimum number of pieces required for certain binary strings. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `10101`. According to the problem, the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange this string into a sorted binary string is 3. The correct pieces would be `10`, `10`, and `1`.

However, the program will output 4 for this input. Let's break down the execution:

- The initial count is set to 1.
- The loop iterates through the string:
  - At `j = 0`, `s[0] != s[1]` (1 != 0), so `count` becomes 2.
  - At `j = 1`, `s[1] != s[2]` (0 != 1), so `count` becomes 3.
  - At `j = 2`, `s[2] != s[3]` (1 != 0), so `count` becomes 4.
  - At `j = 3`, `s[3] != s[4]` (0 != 1), so `count` becomes 5.
- The flag is set to `True` because there is a transition from `0` to `1`.
- The final count is adjusted by subtracting 1 due to the flag, resulting in `count = 4`.

The correct output should be 3, but the program outputs 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
