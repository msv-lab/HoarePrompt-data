Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n` is less than `k`.
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs` during the loop.
- `i` is 1.
- `curr` is 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Calculate `costs`:**
   - Given `n = 0` and `k` is a positive integer, `n - k + 1` will be a negative number because `n < k`.
   - Therefore, `costs` will be `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]`.

2. **Calculate `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients from dividing `n` by each element in `costs`.
   - Since `n = 0`, dividing 0 by any non-zero number results in 0.
   - Therefore, `h` will be the sum of 0 divided by each element in `costs`, which is `0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Check the condition `h >= k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, from the calculation above, `h` is 0, which contradicts the condition `h >= k` unless `k` is also 0, but `k` is a positive integer.

Given the contradiction, it seems there might be an error in the initial state or the conditions provided. However, based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will execute regardless of the logical consistency of the conditions.

### Final Output:
The code snippet simply prints the number 2, regardless of the initial state and the conditions provided.

Output: **2**
