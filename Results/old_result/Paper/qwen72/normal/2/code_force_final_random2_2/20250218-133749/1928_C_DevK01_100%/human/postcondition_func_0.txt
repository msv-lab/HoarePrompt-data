The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `q` and `x`, where both are integers and satisfy the condition 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients (if the quotient is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`). Additionally, if the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`.
