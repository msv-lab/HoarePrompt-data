The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities.
  - `a`: A list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `queries`: A list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the distance between the cities at positions a[x_i] and a[y_i].

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of cities `n`, their positions `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves. It returns a list of distances between the cities specified in the queries.**
