The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must contain at least one element.
- `val` is the first element of `a`.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

The impact of the code is:

- The value of `ai` is updated to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`.

Since `ai` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that exists and is used in the context of the code. The other variables (`a`, `val`, and `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must contain at least one element; `val` is the first element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`; `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.**
