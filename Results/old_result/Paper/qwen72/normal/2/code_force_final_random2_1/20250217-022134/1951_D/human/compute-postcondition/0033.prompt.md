You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `curr` is 0.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: - The first element of `costs` is `1 - k`.
        #   - The second element of `costs` is `1`.
        #
        #Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
        #Output:
    #State: *`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `curr` is 0. If `h` is less than `k`, the program follows the logic for the if part. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program follows the logic for the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^18. The function does not return any value in any case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
