Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `x` depends on the current values of `a` and `i`. The rest of the initial state remains valid.
