Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `mak` is either 0 or 1.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Explanation:
- The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which can be either 0 or 1.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`, which is 2.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and then the value of `i` twice. Since `mak` can be either 0 or 1, the output will be one of the following:

- If `mak` is 0: `? 0 0 2 2`
- If `mak` is 1: `? 1 1 2 2`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is either 0 or 1)**
