The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of list `a` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is converted to a string and appended to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

After executing the code:
- `ans` now includes the string representation of the first element of `a` followed by a space.
- `i` remains 0.
- `bets` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of the first element of `a` followed by a space.**
