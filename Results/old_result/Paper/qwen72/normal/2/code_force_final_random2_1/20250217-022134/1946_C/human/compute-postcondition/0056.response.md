Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (and `b` is appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (and `a` is appended again).** 

The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements, in addition to any other elements it already contained. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
