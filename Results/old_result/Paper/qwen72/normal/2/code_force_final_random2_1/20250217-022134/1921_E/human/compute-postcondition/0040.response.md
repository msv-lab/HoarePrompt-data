Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, `b` is `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2 > x1`, `x1 ≥ 1`, and `x2 ≤ n`. `y2` is greater than `y1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y2` is updated to `m`, which is `r[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The conditions specified in the initial state still hold true, including the relationships between `x1`, `x2`, and `y1`, `y2`.
