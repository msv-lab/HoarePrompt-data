Output State: **If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be 0, `v` will be the last return value of `func_2()`, and `n` remains unchanged. If the loop breaks early due to `v` equaling `n`, `i` will be the value that caused `v` to equal `n`, and `v` will be set to that `i` value.**

In natural language, this means:
- If the loop runs to completion (i.e., it does not break early), the variable `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `n` down to 1. The variable `v` will hold the last value returned by `func_2()`, and `n` will remain the same as its initial value.
- If the loop breaks early because `v` equals `n` at any point during the iteration, `i` will be the value that caused `v` to equal `n`, and `v` will be set to that `i` value. In this case, `n` will also remain unchanged.
