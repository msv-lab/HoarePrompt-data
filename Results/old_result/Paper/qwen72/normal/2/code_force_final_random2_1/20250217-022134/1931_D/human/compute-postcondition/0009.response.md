The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of `num` when divided by `y` and assigns this value to `mod_y`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`) remain unchanged.

Since `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `mod_y` will be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**
