To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `combined`. The loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

From the given state, we know that `combined` is a sorted list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `combined` must contain at least one element. However, the state mentions that if `combined` was not empty, it is now `k` elements shorter. This implies that `combined` might have been shortened, but it does not explicitly state that `combined` is now empty.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to confirm that `combined` has at least one element. Since the state already indicates that `combined` is a sorted list, we can assume it initially had elements. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary if we can guarantee that `combined` still has at least one element after being shortened by `k`.

Given that `k` must be greater than 0, and assuming `combined` initially had more than `k` elements, `combined` should still have elements left after being shortened by `k`.

Thus, the state does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, if `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter.**
