Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` remains -1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is incremented by 1.***
