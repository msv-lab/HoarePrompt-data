Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.***
