### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports should not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads the grid and calculates the cost of building a bridge on each row using `func_1`.
   - It stores these costs in a list and finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is correctly read and parsed.
   - **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` and adds the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - **Consecutive Bridges:** The function correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of the selected rows and finding the minimum among all possible starting rows.

5. **Annotated Code Verification:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program at key points is as expected.
   - The first loop in `func_1` correctly increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
   - The second loop in `func_1` correctly updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The final state of `func_1` is correct, and it returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.
   - In `func_2`, the input is correctly read and processed, and the costs are calculated and stored correctly.
   - The minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges is correctly found and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem requirements. It handles the input, processes the grid, and calculates the minimum cost for building the bridges as specified.

Final: **True**
