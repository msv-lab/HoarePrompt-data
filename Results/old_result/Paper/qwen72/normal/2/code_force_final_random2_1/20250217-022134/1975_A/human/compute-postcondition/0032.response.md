Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `new = a[i:]` assigns to `new` a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 (which is the current value of `i`) to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values specified in the initial state are still valid.
