The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both are integers and satisfy the condition \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). The function returns a list `M` containing pairs of integers. Each pair consists of an integer `i` and its corresponding quotient `q // i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `w-1` (with `w` being the integer square root of `q`). Both `i` and `q // i` must be greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\)) and returns a list `M` of pairs `(i, q // i)` where `i` is a divisor of `q` within the range from 1 to `w-1` (with `w` being the integer square root of `q`), and both `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
