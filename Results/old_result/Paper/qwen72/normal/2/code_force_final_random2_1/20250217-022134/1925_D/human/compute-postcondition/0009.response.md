The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to `a`, `b`, and `f` after converting them to integers.

- `a` is now assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is now assigned the second integer from the input.
- `f` is now assigned the third integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
