Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `temp` is 1, `i` is 2 if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `temp * 2` is not less than `k`.**
