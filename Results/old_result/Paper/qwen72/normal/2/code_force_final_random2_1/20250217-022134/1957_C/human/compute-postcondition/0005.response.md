To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, representing the number of remaining test cases.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`.
- The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
- `num` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`, `num` is 0, `i` is 0**
