To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines:
     - The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).
     - The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement**:
   - `num`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be defined somewhere in the code before the `print` statement is executed.
   - `mod_x`: The remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: The remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: `mod_y`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - `num` is an integer that is part of the current test case.
   - `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Given the above, the `print` statement will output the values of these variables in the specified format.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where num is the value of num, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
