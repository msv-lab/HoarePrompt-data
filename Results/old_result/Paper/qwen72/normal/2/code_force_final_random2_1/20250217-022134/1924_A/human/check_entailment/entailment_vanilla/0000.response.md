### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the set `alphabet` has more than one element, the character is removed from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, the character is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset to contain all `k` alphabets.
   - After the loop, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the result of `func_1`:
     - If `b` (the first element of the tuple) is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
       - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it to form the required string.
     - If `b` is `True`, it means all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the results to the list `OUT` and prints them at the end.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
  - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
  - The logic of removing characters from `alphabet` and resetting it does not ensure that all combinations are checked.
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for checking subsequences is flawed, and the conditions used are not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**False**
