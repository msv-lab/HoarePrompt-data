To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `sum_f` is `m * f`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `cn2`:**
   \[
   \text{cn2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Calculate `sum_f`:**
   \[
   \text{sum_f} = m \times f
   \]

3. **Calculate `p`:**
   \[
   \text{p} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

4. **Calculate `q`:**
   \[
   \text{q} = \frac{2 \times \text{cn2}}{\text{gcd}}
   \]

5. **Calculate `gcd`:**
   \[
   \text{gcd} = \text{gcd}(p, q)
   \]

6. **Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`:**
   \[
   \text{mod\_inverse} = \text{pow}(q, -1, M)
   \]

7. **Compute the final result:**
   \[
   \text{result} = \left( p \times \text{mod\_inverse} \right) \% M
   \]

### Explanation of the Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`. This involves several steps:
- Calculating `p` and `q` based on the given formulas.
- Finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p` and `q`.
- Computing the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
- Multiplying `p` by the modular inverse of `q` and taking the result modulo `M`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `f`, and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the result. However, the output will be the result of the described computation.

### Final Output:
Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are computed based on the given formulas and gcd is the greatest common divisor of p and q)**
