Functionality: **The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It internally calls `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` to process data and provide the necessary inputs. The specific return value depends on the outputs of these internal functions, but the overall functionality is to coordinate the execution of these three functions and return the result of their combined processing.**
