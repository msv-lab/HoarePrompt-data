Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is `a[3]`.***
