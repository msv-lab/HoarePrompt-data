The code snippet `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `x` and the second part to `a`, both converted to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2
- No two constraints are the same within a test case
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `less` is an empty list
- `big` is an empty list
- `no` is an empty list
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable2` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `x` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**
