Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the rules provided. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This is because the game involves alternating moves and removing one coin per move, which means the game will end when the player whose turn it is has no coins left to remove. If the initial difference in the number of coins is even, the players will always be able to mirror each other's moves until the last coin, leading to a situation where the player who started (Alice) will lose. Conversely, if the difference is odd, the starting player (Alice) can force a win by ensuring she never runs out of coins first.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:`. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob will win. If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice will win.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program's logic aligns perfectly with the expected outcomes. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
