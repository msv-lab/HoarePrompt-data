Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It processes the string `s` by iterating through its characters and maintaining two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are part of a dynamically changing set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the set has more than one element, the character is removed from the set; if the set has exactly one element, the character is added to `s2` and the set is reset to the original `k` alphabets. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2` which contains characters added when the set had exactly one element left. **
