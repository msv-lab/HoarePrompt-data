Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, `soma_b` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `soma_b` to 0, which overrides any previous conditions affecting `soma_b`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
