Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the game problem by analyzing the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and determining the outcome based on the rules of movement and the conditions for winning or drawing. However, there are several issues and potential improvements to consider:

1. **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would cause a runtime error in Python. The function should be defined before it is called.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads input inside the `func_1` function, which is fine, but it should be ensured that the input format matches the expected format (six integers per test case).

3. **Logic Complexity**: The logic within `func_1` is quite complex and involves multiple conditional checks and updates to the positions of the chips. While the logic seems to cover various scenarios, it is not immediately clear if all edge cases are handled correctly.

4. **Optimal Play Assumption**: The problem statement specifies that both players play optimally. The current implementation attempts to simulate the optimal moves, but the complexity of the logic makes it difficult to verify correctness without thorough testing.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases such as when Alice or Bob is already in a position where they cannot move, or when the initial positions are such that one player can immediately win.

Given these points, the program appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly, but the structure and logic are complex and could benefit from simplification and more thorough testing.

Correctness: **False**

The program has structural issues (function call order) and the logic is complex, making it difficult to verify correctness without extensive testing. Therefore, the program is not considered correct as it stands.
