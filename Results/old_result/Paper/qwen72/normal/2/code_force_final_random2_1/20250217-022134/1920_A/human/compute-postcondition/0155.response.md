The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. The function accepts input through some external means (e.g., user input, file reading, etc.), which includes:

- An integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair `(a, x)` where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. All pairs `(a, x)` are distinct within a test case, and there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints provided for each test case. The exact nature of the output is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function will produce some form of output for each test case based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
