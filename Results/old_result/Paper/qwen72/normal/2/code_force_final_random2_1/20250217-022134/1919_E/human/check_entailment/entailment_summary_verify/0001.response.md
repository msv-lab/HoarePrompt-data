### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of only 1s and -1s that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with an offset to handle negative indices.
   - The DP array `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum `j - n` using the first `i` elements of `a`.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the DP array based on the previous state.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, we can either add 1 or -1 to it.
   - This is reflected in the transitions: `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is `p[-1]`.
   - We adjust this sum using the offset and return the value from the DP array.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as small and large values of `n`.
   - It ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range and the DP array is updated correctly.

7. **Verification Using Function Summaries:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly computes the number of ways to form the given prefix sum array `p` using dynamic programming. The DP transitions are correctly implemented, and the final result is adjusted using the offset.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function correctly reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It ensures that the input is parsed correctly and the results are stored and printed as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming and handles the input and output as specified. The function summaries confirm that both functions behave as expected and handle the problem requirements accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
