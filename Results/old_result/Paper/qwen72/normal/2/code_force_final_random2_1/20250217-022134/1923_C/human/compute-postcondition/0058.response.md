Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and the total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain as the integers read from user input.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The list `p` now contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For example, if `l` was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `p` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
- The variable `c` is now the sum of all elements in `l`.
- The variable `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`.
- The variables `a` and `b` remain as the integers read from user input.
- The total number of iterations (input by the user) must still be greater than the new value of `_`.
