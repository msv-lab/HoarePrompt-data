The code snippet `t.append(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the updated state:

- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element.
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, otherwise `t` is a list containing the value `ai`.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`.
- `ai` is `ai ^ val`.

After executing `t.append(ai)`:

- The list `t` now contains the value `ai`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is a list containing the value `ai`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`.**
