The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. Since `sunks` was initially 0, 1, or 2, after the increment, `sunks` will be 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3.**
