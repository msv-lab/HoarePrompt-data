Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` reassigns the value of `l` to the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, the new value of `l` is also less than `n + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
