The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value passed to `range(int(input()))`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, the key point is that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. This means that the input to `range(int(input()))` should be `t`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` will start from 0 (as it is the default behavior of `range`).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
