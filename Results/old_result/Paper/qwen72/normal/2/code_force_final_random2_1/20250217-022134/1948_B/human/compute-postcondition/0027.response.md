Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `i` must be greater than 0. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
