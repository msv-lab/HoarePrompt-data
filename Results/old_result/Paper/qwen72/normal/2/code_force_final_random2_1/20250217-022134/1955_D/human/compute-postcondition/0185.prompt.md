Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the required number of matching elements, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `fnd` will be the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. The `D`, `E`, and `C` counters will reflect the final state of the intersection and differences between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after processing all elements in the loop. The `pairs_in_D` will be the final count of intersecting pairs in `D`. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, and `cnt_bb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`. The `C`, `D`, and `E` dictionaries are updated based on the conditions described in the loop. Specifically, for each `in_aa` and `out_aa` processed, `D` and `E` are adjusted to reflect the movement of elements between these sets, and `pairs_in_D` is updated to reflect the current count of pairs in `D`. The variable `fnd` is incremented by 1 each time `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` after processing each pair, otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, the lists `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` will be fully iterated through, meaning all elements in these slices have been processed. The variables `in_aa` and `out_aa` will have been updated to the last elements of their respective slices during the final iteration. The counters `D`, `E`, and `C` will reflect the changes made during each iteration, with `D` potentially having more elements added and `E` and `C` having elements removed or adjusted based on the conditions within the loop. The variable `pairs_in_D` will be the final count of the sum of values in the dictionary `D`. The variable `fnd` will be the total count of iterations where `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
