The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.

- Initial State:
  - `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
  - `j` is 2
  - `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0
  - `i` is `n`
  - `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]`, `new_dp[2]`, and if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`
  - `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`

- Impact of the code:
  - `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`
  - Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1
  - Therefore, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`

- Calculation:
  - `new_dp[1]` was initially 0 or some value (let's call it `val1`)
  - `dp[2]` is the same as `new_dp[2]` (since `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`)
  - `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(val1 + new_dp[2]) % MOD`

- Output State:
  - `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
  - `j` is 2
  - `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0
  - `i` is `n`
  - `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]`, `new_dp[2]`, and if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`
  - `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`
  - `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + new_dp[2]) % MOD`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]`, `new_dp[2]`, and if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`, `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + new_dp[2]) % MOD`.**
