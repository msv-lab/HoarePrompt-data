### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves building bridges across a river represented as a grid. Each cell in the grid has a depth, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for the bridges.
   - The constraints include the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function processes a single row of the grid to calculate the cost of installing supports.
     - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
     - For the remaining elements, it calculates the minimum cost of installing supports within a window of size `d+1` and adds the original value of the cell plus 1.
     - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost for that row.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input, including the dimensions of the grid and the parameters `k` and `d`.
     - It processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
     - It then calculates the total cost for every possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these total costs.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input is read correctly, and the grid is constructed as expected.
   - **Row Processing**: `func_1` correctly processes each row according to the problem's requirements, ensuring that the cost is calculated based on the minimum support distances.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for every possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost among these sequences.
   - **Output**: The final output is the minimum total cost, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows in the grid, adhering to the given constraints and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
