To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `results` since it is the only object in the loop head. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The other states mentioned (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, and `result`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty. Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**
