The only object in the loop head is the variable `res` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `res` is the second element in the list `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least two elements (since the loop iterates over each element in `results`). After the last iteration, `res` was the second element in the list. For the next iteration, `res` will be the third element in the list, assuming `results` has at least three elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the third element in the list `results`**
