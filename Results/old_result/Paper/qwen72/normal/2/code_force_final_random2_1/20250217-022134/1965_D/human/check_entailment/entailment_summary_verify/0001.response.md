### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to recover a palindromic array `a` of length `n` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum to reconstruct the array `a`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends them to the list `cts`.
   - The list `cts` is then sorted.
   - **Accuracy:** This function is correct and serves its purpose of generating and sorting all subarray sums.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - It uses a stack-like approach to cancel out pairs of identical sums, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times.
   - For a palindromic array, the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times will help us identify the elements of the array.
   - **Accuracy:** This function is correct and serves its purpose of identifying the unique subarray sums.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function constructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums identified in `func_2`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums, placing the values in the middle of the array if the index is the same for both ends, otherwise splitting the value equally between the corresponding positions.
   - **Accuracy:** This function correctly constructs the palindromic array `a`.

5. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until it finds the first mismatch, which is the missing subarray sum.
   - **Accuracy:** This function is correct and serves its purpose of finding the missing subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended task accurately, and the overall approach is sound.

**Final: **True**
