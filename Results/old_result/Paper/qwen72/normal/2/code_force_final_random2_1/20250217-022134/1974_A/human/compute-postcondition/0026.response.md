The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the variable `b` from a string to an integer. This impacts the type of `b` but does not change its numerical value. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `t` is `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`, if `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is updated as follows: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, `t2` remains `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.**
