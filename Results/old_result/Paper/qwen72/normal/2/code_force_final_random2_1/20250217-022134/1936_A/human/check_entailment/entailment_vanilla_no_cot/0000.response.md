Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the specifications. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program iterates through the elements to find an index `mak` such that `p_mak` is the maximum element in the permutation. This is done by comparing `p_mak | p_mak` with `p_i | p_i` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
   - Once the maximum element is found, the program then tries to find another index `mak2` such that the XOR of `p_mak` and `p_mak2` is maximized. This is done by comparing `p_mak | p_mak2` with `p_i | p_mak2` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Refining the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - The program collects all indices `pans` that have the same value as `p_mak2` when compared with `p_mak`. It then finds the index within `pans` that maximizes the XOR with `p_mak`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` which form the pair with the maximum XOR value.

6. **Query Management**:
   - The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the limit of 3n by carefully managing the queries within the loops.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program effectively uses the allowed queries to find the required indices, making it a correct solution.
