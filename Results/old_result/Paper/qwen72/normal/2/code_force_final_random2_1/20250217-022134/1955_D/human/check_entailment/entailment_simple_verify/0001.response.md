### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b` as lists of strings, which is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness since the elements are converted to integers when needed.

2. **Initial Counters**:
   - It initializes `cnt_aa` with the first `m` elements of `a` using `Counter`.
   - It initializes `cnt_bb` with all elements of `b` using `Counter`.

3. **Intersection and Differences**:
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, representing the common elements and their counts.
   - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of values in `D`, which represents the number of matching elements.
   - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, representing elements in `a` that are not in `b`.
   - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, representing elements in `b` that are not in `a`.

4. **Initial Check**:
   - If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, it sets `fnd` to 1, indicating that the initial segment is good.

5. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element `in_aa` and the element being removed `out_aa`:
     - It updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - It checks if the updated `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `fnd` if true.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments, it prints the value of `fnd` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of the Sliding Window Logic:

- **Initialization**:
  - `cnt_aa` is initialized with the first `m` elements of `a`.
  - `cnt_bb` is initialized with all elements of `b`.
  - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.
  - `pairs_in_D` is the sum of values in `D`.
  - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`.
  - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.

- **Sliding Window Update**:
  - For each new element `in_aa` and the element being removed `out_aa`:
    - If `out_aa` is in `D`:
      - If `out_aa` is also in `E`, decrement `E[out_aa]`.
      - Otherwise, decrement `D[out_aa]`, decrement `pairs_in_D`, and increment `C[out_aa]`.
    - If `out_aa` is not in `D`, simply decrement `E[out_aa]`.
    - If `in_aa` is in `C`:
      - Increment `D[in_aa]`, increment `pairs_in_D`, and decrement `C[in_aa]`.
    - Otherwise, increment `E[in_aa]`.
    - Check if the updated `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and increment `fnd` if true.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
- The logic for updating the counters and checking the number of matching elements is sound.
- The program should handle the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
