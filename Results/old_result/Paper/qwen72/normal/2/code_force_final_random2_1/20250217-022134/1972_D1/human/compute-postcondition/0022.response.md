The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. This operation changes the value of `info`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `t` is 1
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `i` is `b`
- `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\)

After executing the code:
- `info` is now a list of strings obtained from the new input.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\)**.
