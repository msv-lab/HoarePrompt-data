Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` has a logical error in the way it checks the conditions for the password. Specifically, the check for whether any digit comes after a letter is not correctly implemented. The code incorrectly compares the last digit with the first letter, which is not the correct approach to ensure no digit comes after a letter.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if there is any digit that comes after a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures:
1. Digits and letters are sorted.
2. No digit comes after a letter.

With this correction, the program should work as expected for the given problem description.
