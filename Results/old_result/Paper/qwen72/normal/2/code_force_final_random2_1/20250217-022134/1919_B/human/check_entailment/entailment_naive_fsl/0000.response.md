Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute value of this difference. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which is a key requirement of the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0`, because the array can be split into `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` and further into subarrays like `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, each of which has a penalty of `0`. However, the provided program would return `6` because it simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `0` in this case, but the program incorrectly returns `6`.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle the problem's requirements correctly for all potential cases.
