Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then `s` is updated as described in the if part. Otherwise, `s` is updated as described in the else part.***
