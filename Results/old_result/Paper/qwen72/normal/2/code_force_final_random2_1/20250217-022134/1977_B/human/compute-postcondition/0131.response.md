The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the third element (index 2) of `s` is changed from its original value ('1' or '0') to `'-1'`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where `s[2]` is `'-1'` and the other elements are either '1' or '0', `flag` is 0.**
