Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If a bit in `x` is set (i.e., 1), the corresponding element in `s` is '1'. If a bit in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), the corresponding element in `s` is '0'. `flag` is 0.**
