The code snippet `combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])` sorts the list `combined` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order. This operation does not change the values of the elements themselves, only their order within the list.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 1
- `heap` is an empty list
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`
- `current_profit` is 0
- `max_profit` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the order of elements in the `combined` list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**
