To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `min_indices`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` is a list containing the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.

For the loop to execute:
- `min_indices` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `i` will take on each value in `min_indices` during the loop's execution.

Since the loop iterates over `min_indices`, the loop will execute if `min_indices` is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `min_indices` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is `n-1`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`**.
