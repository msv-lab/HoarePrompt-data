The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must still be at least 3 (or more specifically, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue).

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 4, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 8.**
