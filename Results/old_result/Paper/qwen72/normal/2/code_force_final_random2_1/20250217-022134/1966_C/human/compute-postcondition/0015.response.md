The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the next element in the list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element, and `sz` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.

Given that `sz` was the next element in the list `a` during the last iteration, for the next iteration, `sz` will be the element following it in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `sz`. If this new `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3 if the first element of `a` (`sz`) is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 2.**
