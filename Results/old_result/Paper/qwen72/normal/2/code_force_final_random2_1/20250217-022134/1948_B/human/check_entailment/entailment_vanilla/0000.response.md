### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function starts with the assumption that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The function iterates backward through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This is a good approach because it allows us to check if the current element is less than the previous element, which would indicate a potential issue.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, it means the array is not currently sorted at this point.
   - The function then splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends the current element `arr[i]` to these digits.
   - It checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If it is not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Update Array:**
   - If the resulting list of digits is sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by the given operations.
- However, there is a subtle issue: the function only checks the immediate next element after splitting. It does not ensure that the entire array remains sorted after the operation.
- For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. When the function processes `28` and `5`, it splits `28` into `[2, 8]` and checks if `[2, 8, 5]` is sorted. It is, so it updates `arr` to `[12, 2, 8, 5]`. However, the final array `[12, 2, 8, 5]` is not sorted, but the function will incorrectly output `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in ensuring the entire array remains sorted after the operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
