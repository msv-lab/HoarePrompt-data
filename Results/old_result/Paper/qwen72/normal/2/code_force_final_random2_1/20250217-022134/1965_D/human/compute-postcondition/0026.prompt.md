Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000 and `n` is the length of the array `a` to be recovered, `a` is a list of zeros of length `n`, `prev` is 0, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of zeros of length `n`. If `idx` (which is `(n - 1) // 2`) is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then the element at index `idx` in `a` is set to `x`. Otherwise, the elements at indices `idx` and `n - 1 - idx` in `a` are set to `x // 2` and `(x - prev) // 2` respectively. `prev` is now `x`. `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`. The list `a` remains unchanged in this step.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 3`, `odds` must have at least one more element. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the next element in `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
