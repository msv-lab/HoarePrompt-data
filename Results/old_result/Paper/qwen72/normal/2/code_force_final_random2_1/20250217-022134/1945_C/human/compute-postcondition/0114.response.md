The code snippet updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Given that `ele` is the first element in `lst`, and `lst` contains at least one element, the calculation of `abs(pk - ele)` will proceed without issues. The value of `mini` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**
