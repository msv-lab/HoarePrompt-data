The value of `v` is updated to the return value of the function `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Since the specific return value of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `v`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
