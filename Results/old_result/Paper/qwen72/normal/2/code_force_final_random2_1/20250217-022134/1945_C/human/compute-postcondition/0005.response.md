Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `n` is an even integer, `pk` will be an integer equal to half of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
