Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, and smallList is a sublist of bigList.
Code of the loop:
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    bigList.pop()
    smallList.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last element removed, and the last element of `bigList` may no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer necessarily equal to the last element of `smallList`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last three elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
