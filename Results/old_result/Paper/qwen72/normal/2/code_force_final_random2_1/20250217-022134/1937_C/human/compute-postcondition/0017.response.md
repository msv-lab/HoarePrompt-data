Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `i` is 2; `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, which remains unchanged; `max_index` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `max_index`. Therefore, `max_index` is now 2. All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
