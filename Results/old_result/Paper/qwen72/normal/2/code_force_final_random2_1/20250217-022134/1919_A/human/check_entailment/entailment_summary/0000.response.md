Reasoning:  
The logic implemented in the program is based on the observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This is because, in each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin. The key insight is that the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets remains unchanged after each move. Therefore, if the initial difference is even, it will remain even throughout the game, and if it is odd, it will remain odd.

Given that both players play optimally, the player who starts with the advantage (i.e., the player who can force the other into a losing position) will win. Specifically:
- If the difference between the number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who eventually cannot make a move.
- If the difference is odd, Alice will win because she can force Bob into a position where the difference becomes even, and then Bob will be in the same situation as Alice was in the even-difference scenario.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

Therefore, the program is correct.
