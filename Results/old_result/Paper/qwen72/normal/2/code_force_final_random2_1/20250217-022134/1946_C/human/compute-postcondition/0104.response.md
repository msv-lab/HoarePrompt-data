Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` three times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` three times.** 

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` included `a` twice, so after executing the code, `adj[b]` now includes `a` three times. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
