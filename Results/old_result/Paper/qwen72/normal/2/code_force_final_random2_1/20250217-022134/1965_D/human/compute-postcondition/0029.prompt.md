You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, n is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000 and n is the length of the array a to be recovered.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be filled with the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`. The variable `prev` will be set to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be less than 0. The list `odds` will remain unchanged, and `n` will still be the same positive integer representing the length of `a`.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` which is filled with the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`. The list `a` will have a length of `n`, and its values will be determined by the elements of `odds`. The variable `prev` will be set to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be less than 0, but these variables are not part of the return. The list `odds` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, and `n`, a positive integer indicating the length of the array `a` to be recovered, where 3 <= n <= 1000. The function returns a list `a` of length `n`, filled with values determined by the elements of `odds`. The list `odds` remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `a` which is filled with the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`. The list `a` will have a length of `n`, and its values will be determined by the elements of `odds`. The variable `prev` will be set to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` will be less than 0, but these variables are not part of the return. The list `odds` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
