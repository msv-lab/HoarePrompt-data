Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Specific Case**: The function starts with a specific check for the string `'mapie'`. This is unnecessary because the logic that follows can handle this case without needing a special condition. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program for other cases.

2. **Handling Substring 'map'**: The program correctly identifies and removes occurrences of the substring `'map'` by finding the index of the substring and slicing the string to remove it. It increments the counter `ans` each time a removal occurs.

3. **Handling Substring 'pie'**: Similarly, the program handles the substring `'pie'` by finding and removing it, incrementing the counter `ans` each time.

4. **Final Return**: The function returns the total count of characters removed (`ans`), which is the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the string is initially beautiful (no occurrences of 'map' or 'pie') by returning 0, as the `while` loops will not execute.

6. **Efficiency**: While the program is correct, it could be optimized. For example, the specific check for `'mapie'` is redundant and can be removed. Additionally, the program could be more efficient by using a single pass to find and remove both substrings simultaneously, but this does not affect the correctness.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
