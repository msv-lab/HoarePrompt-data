The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `c` and `r` are input integers, these conditions still hold true.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is increased by 2.**
