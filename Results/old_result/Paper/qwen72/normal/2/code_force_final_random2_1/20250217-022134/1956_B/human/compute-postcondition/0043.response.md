The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input with all its elements processed
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`
- `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers derived from the new input.

The other variables (`n`, `cnt`, `ans`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`, `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration in the range of the new input integer.**
