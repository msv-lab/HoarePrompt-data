Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the same input integer, `s` is the same input string, `pk` is still set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is still a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is still the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is still the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is still \(10^8\), `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` contains all indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is the integer value of `(o * 100) // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0 and has a length of 1. Otherwise, `final` now includes `n` and has a length of 1.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
