Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to `ans + max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value.
- The value of `x` is the next element in the list `cnt`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans` after the update depends on the current value of `x` in the list `cnt`. If `x` is 1 or less, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `x - 1`.
