The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2 and updates `t` with the new value. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `t` was initially defined as `2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD`.
- After executing `t *= 2`, `t` becomes `2 * (2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD)`.

All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `2 * (2 * ((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) % MOD)`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD`.**
