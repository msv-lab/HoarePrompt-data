To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not 1, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`.
- If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(k + 1)`, which means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `k`.
- The loop condition is based on `i` being less than `k + 1`.

### States to Adjust:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `k + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 1, otherwise `sums` is updated as described in the problem statement.**
