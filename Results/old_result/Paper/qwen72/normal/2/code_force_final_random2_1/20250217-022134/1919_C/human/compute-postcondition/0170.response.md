Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is `l[n - 1]`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `c` is 0, and the value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
