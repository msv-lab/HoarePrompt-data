The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, `arr` is a list that was previously defined as part of the `info` structure. The specific content of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, which is derived from the input integer.

- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is initially `[1]`.
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is initially `[26]`.
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` is initially an empty list `[]`.

After executing `arr.append(1)`, the value `1` is added to the end of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1], and `lex` is the input integer minus 1. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 1], and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26). If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 1], and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between 26 and 52). If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [1], and `lex` is the input integer.**
