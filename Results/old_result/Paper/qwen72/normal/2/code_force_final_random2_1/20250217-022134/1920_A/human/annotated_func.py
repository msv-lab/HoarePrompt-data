#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution set. No two constraints are the same within a test case.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` is the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `iterable` is `loop - 1`, `num` is the final calculated value of `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the number of elements in `no` that satisfy `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the input integer for the last iteration, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a list of integers where `x` was 3, `less` is a list of integers where `x` was 2, `big` is a list of integers where `x` was 1. If `num` is less than 1, the value of `num` printed is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for type 1, `less` for type 2, and `no` for type 3. It calculates the number of valid solutions as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusting this count by subtracting the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. If the calculated number of solutions is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the calculated number. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t` and `n` unchanged.
