The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

If the first character of `s` is 'L':
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 1)
- `i` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `b` is a list containing `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`
- `l` is 1
- `r` was `n - 1` and is now `n - 2`

If the first character of `s` is 'R':
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 1)
- `i` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `b` is a list containing `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`
- `l` is 0
- `r` was `n - 2` and is now `n - 3`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the appropriate elements based on the first character of `s`, `l` is the same as before, `r` is decreased by 1.**
