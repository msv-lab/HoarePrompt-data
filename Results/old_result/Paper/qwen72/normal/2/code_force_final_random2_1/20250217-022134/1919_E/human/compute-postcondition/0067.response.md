Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`. `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is within the bounds of the list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains 1.
- The condition `2 * n + 1` being greater than 0 remains true.
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The list `new_dp` remains a list of length `2 * n + 1` with each element initially set to 0, except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- The list `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.
- The element `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is within the bounds of the list. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which is within the bounds of the list. Therefore, `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
