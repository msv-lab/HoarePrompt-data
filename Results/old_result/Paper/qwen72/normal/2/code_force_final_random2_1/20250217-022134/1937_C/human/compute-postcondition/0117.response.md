Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 1.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, the state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
