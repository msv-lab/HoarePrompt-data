The code snippet `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- If `m` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If `m` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
