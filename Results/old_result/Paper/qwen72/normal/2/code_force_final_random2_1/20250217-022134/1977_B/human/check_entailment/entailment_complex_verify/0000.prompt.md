You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `nalla` is equal to `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the final state of `flag` and `s[29]`, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The list `s` represents the modified binary representation of `x` after processing all the rules specified in the loop, including the propagation of `-1` through the list and the potential addition of an extra bit if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30). It then processes `x` to generate a modified binary representation stored in a list `s`. This list is manipulated according to specific rules, potentially extending its length to 31 bits. Finally, the function prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for converting the binary representation of `x` into the required array `a` with the constraints does not always produce a valid result. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
x = 15
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```

However, let's consider another test case:

### Test Case:
```
x = 27
```

### Expected Output:
```
6
-1 0 -1 0 0 1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
6
-1 0 -1 0 0 1
```

While the program produces the correct output for these specific cases, it does not guarantee correctness for all cases. For instance, consider the following test case:

### Test Case:
```
x = 11
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
-1 0 1 0 1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
-1 0 1 0 1
```

However, the program's logic for adjusting the array elements (`s`) to meet the constraints is complex and may fail in edge cases. For example, if `x` has a pattern that causes the `flag` mechanism to incorrectly adjust the array, the output may not meet the requirement that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

To ensure the program is correct, it should be thoroughly tested with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and large values of `x`. Given the complexity of the logic and the potential for edge cases, the program cannot be guaranteed to be correct for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
