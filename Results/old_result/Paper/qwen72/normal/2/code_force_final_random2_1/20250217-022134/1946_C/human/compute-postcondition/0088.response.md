Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged, `L` is the largest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is false, `R` is the smallest value such that the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is true, and `numCuts` is 0.** 

This means that after the loop completes, the values of `L` and `R` will have converged to the point where the binary search condition is no longer met, with `L` being the highest value for which the condition fails and `R` being the lowest value for which the condition succeeds. The other variables outside the loop remain unchanged.
