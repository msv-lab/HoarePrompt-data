Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `k` is greater than 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `x` where `0 <= x < n`. Therefore, `l = x + 1`.
   - `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to assume it is a variable that exists in the context of the code. Let's denote the value of `v` as `v`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.
   - `l` is `x + 1` where `x` is a value less than `n`.
   - `i * v` is `2 * v` since `i` is 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [x + 1] [2 * v] (where x is a value less than n and v is the value of v)**
