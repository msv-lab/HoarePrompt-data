Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string values, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `n` and `m` as integers, `b` as `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` being greater than or equal to 1, `T` being 1, and `ans` being `n`.
- The code snippet `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` updates the value of `ans`.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.
