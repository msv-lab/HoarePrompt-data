Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 3`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `b` remains as it was before the loop started if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 3]`. `a` is updated to `l[y + 3]` if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains as it was before the loop started. `n` must be greater than `y + 3`.**
