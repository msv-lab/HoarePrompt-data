To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

- Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 12, m // 4)`. `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.

Given the code:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

1. **Calculate the new value of `cnt`:**
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 2
   - The expression `((x + y) * x)` evaluates to `(3 + 2) * 3 = 15`
   - The expression `((x + y) * y)` evaluates to `(3 + 2) * 2 = 10`
   - `n // 15` gives the integer division of `n` by 15
   - `m // 10` gives the integer division of `m` by 10
   - `min(n // 15, m // 10)` finds the minimum of these two results
   - `cnt` is incremented by this minimum value

2. **Update the state:**
   - `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n // 15, m // 10)`
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`. `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.**
