The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns each part to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which means the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` will all be positive integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will be assigned the values from the input, and they will all be positive integers. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers.**
