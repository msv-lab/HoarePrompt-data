Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Element Case**: In `func_1`, the condition `if n == 1:` checks if the list has only one element, but it incorrectly uses `n` instead of `nums[0]` to determine the length of the single number. This should be fixed to use the actual number in the list.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list using `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`. However, this does not account for the fact that Anna can reverse the digits of any number, which might change the total number of digits.

3. **Incorrect Use of `zerocnts` Function**: The `zerocnts` function is intended to count trailing zeros, but it is used incorrectly in the main function. The logic to subtract the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count is flawed because it does not accurately reflect the changes in the game state after Anna's and Sasha's moves.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The final decision `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'` is based on the total number of digits, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the winner. The game involves strategic moves by both players, and the outcome depends on the specific values and the order of operations, not just the total number of digits.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, considering the strategic nature of the game and the optimal moves by both players. The current implementation does not capture the complexity of the game rules and the optimal strategies.
