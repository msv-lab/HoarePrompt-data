Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k` elements shorter. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. In all cases, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+1` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was previously in the heap and has been replaced by `item`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` was updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` was updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` was updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+2` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+3` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was pushed out of `heap` when `item` was added, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or to `current_profit + item[0]` otherwise, and if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
