Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`) and the value of `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`, which is equal to `c[0]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `c[0]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
