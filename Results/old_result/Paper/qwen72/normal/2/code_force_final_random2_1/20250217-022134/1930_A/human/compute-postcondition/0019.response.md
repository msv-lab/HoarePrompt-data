Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Remains greater than 0.
- **`i`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Becomes an empty list because the loop continues until all elements are removed from `numbers`.
- **`suma`**: Contains the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`. This means that for every two elements removed from `numbers`, the smaller of the two is added to `suma`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where all elements have been processed and `numbers` is empty, and `suma` contains the accumulated sum of the minimum values of each pair.
