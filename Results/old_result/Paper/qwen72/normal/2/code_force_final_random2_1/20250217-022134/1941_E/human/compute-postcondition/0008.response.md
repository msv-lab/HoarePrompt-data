The code appends the sum of the slice of `costs` from index `i` to `i + k` (exclusive) to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is 1, the new element appended to `total_costs` will be the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k` (exclusive) of the `costs` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`.**
