Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice, and `k` is `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.***
