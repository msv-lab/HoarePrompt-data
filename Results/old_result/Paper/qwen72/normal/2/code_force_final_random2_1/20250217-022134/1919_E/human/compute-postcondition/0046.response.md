The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the expression `2 * n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `2 * n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `2 * n + 1` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 2), and `2 * n + 1` must still be greater than `j` (which means `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 2).

Since `n` is a positive integer and `2 * n + 1` is already greater than 1, it will remain greater than 2 as long as `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2, `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros.**
