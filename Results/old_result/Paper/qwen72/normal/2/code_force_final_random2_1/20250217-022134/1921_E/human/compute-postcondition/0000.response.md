The code snippet `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.

After executing the code:
- `r` is a list of six integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged, but now `r` contains the values of these variables for one test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.**
