The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is already defined in the initial state, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` are now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is `a2` and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is `a1`.**
