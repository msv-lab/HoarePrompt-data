The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` by taking the remainder of `t` divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that `t` is within the range [0, MOD-1].

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a` multiplied by 2
- `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet `t %= MOD`:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t % MOD`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0.**
