To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - Conditions involving `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` are given but are not directly part of the loop head.

2. **Adjusting the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented to 3, the loop will execute again if `i < n`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is now 3, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged. In both the if and else parts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
