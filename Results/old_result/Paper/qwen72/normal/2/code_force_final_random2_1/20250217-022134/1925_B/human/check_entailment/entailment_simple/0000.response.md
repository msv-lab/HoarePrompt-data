### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over them. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The goal is to find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`. The program uses a loop to iterate through potential divisors of `x` (up to the square root of `x`), checking if they are divisors and if they meet the condition `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. If either condition is true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` or `x // i`.

4. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no valid divisor is found, `ans` remains 0, which is the correct output for such cases.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problem set. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
