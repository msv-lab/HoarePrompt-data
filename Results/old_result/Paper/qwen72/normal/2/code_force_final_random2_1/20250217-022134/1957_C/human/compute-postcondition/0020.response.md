The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4. After the increment, `num` will be 4 if `c` equals `r`, and 6 if `c` does not equal `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 < `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 6.**
