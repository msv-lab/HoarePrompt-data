Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, and the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
