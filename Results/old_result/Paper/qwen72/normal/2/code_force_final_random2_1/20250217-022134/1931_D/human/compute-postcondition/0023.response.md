Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mod_x` is updated to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `num`) remain unchanged or are derived from their previous values.
