Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `I` and `R` are defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is the new user input. If the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>'. If the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged.***
