The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `n`.

- `x` is now the first integer from the input.
- `n` is now the second integer from the input.

The initial state constraints for `t`, `x`, and `n` remain valid, but the specific values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**
