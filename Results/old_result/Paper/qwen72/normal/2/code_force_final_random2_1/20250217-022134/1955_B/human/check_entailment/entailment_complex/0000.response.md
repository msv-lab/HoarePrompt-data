Reasoning:

The program aims to verify if the elements in the list `l` can form a progressive square based on the given rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element**: Inside `func_1`, the minimum element `a` is found from the list `l`. This is used as the starting point for constructing the progressive square.

4. **Constructing the Progressive Square**:
   - A new list `li` is initialized.
   - A nested loop iterates over `k` from 0 to `n-1` and `h` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each pair `(k, h)`, the value `a + k * c + d * h` is appended to `li`.

5. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both `li` and `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted `li` is equal to the sorted `l`.

6. **Return Values**:
   - If the sorted lists are equal, the function returns 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Minimum Element**: Using the minimum element `a` from `l` ensures that the starting point of the progressive square is correctly identified.
- **Progressive Square Construction**: The nested loop correctly generates all elements of the progressive square based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists before comparison ensures that the order of elements does not affect the result. This is a valid approach because the elements of the progressive square should match the elements in `l` regardless of their initial order.

### Edge Cases:
- **Valid Input Ranges**: The program handles the constraints for `n`, `c`, `d`, and the elements of `l` as specified.
- **Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the range `t`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if the elements in `l` can form a progressive square based on the given rules. The steps are logically sound and handle the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
