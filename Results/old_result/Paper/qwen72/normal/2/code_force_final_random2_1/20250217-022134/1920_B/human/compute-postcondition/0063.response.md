Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for updating `ans` and `sums` based on the value of `i` and `i + x - 1` is not affected by this code snippet.
