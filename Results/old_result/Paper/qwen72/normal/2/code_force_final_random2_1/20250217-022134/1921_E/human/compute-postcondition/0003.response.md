Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is `r[0]`, which is the first element of the list `r`.
- `m` is `r[1]`, which is the second element of the list `r`.
- `x1` is `r[2]`, which is the third element of the list `r`.
- `y1` is `r[3]`, which is the fourth element of the list `r`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`, which is the fifth element of the list `r`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`, which is the sixth element of the list `r`.
- `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where:
  - 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6
  - 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9
  - Either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b
- Additionally, `x2` (which is `x_b`) is less than or equal to `x1` (which is `x_a`).

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('draw')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
