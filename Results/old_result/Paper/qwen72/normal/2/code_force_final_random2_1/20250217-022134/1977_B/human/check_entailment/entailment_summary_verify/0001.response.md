### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function converts the integer `x` into a binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29. This is correct because the maximum value of `x` is less than \(2^{30}\), so 30 bits are sufficient.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function uses a flag to handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.
   - It iterates through the binary representation and adjusts the values to ensure that if two consecutive '1's are found, the first one is changed to '-1' and a carry is set.
   - If a carry is set and the next bit is '0', it is changed to '1' and the carry is reset.
   - If the carry reaches the last bit, it is handled appropriately by either setting the last bit to '1' or appending an additional '1' to the list.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the initial adjustments, the function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'.
   - This step is crucial to meet the requirement that there should not be two consecutive non-zero elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Conversion**:
  - The function correctly converts the integer `x` to a binary representation and stores it in the list `s`.

- **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
  - The use of the flag to manage carries and adjust the binary representation ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
  - The logic for setting and resetting the flag is sound and correctly handles the carry propagation.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final pass to adjust any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1' ensures that the output meets the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the required output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
