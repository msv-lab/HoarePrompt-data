Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` sets the value of `v1` to the value of `v2`. Since `v2` is 2, `v1` is now also 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
