Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed. For each tuple, `a3` is the first integer, and `l3` is the list of the remaining integers. The loop will print 'yes' if for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` contains all elements of the list `l` except for `a3`. Otherwise, the loop will print 'no' and terminate early.**

Explanation:
- `m` must be at least 3 to ensure there are at least `m - 2` tuples in `val`.
- `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each of which is processed by the loop.
- For each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, the loop checks if `l3` is equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed.
- If any tuple fails this check, the loop prints 'no' and terminates.
- If all tuples pass the check, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.
