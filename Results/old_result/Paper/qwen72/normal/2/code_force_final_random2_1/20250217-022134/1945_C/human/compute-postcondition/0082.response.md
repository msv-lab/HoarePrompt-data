Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is the integer value of `(o * 100) // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0 and has a length of 1. Otherwise, `final` now includes `n` and has a length of 1.**
