Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to fit `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a grid of 5x3 cells per screen. The logic in the program is designed to handle this by first calculating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`t`), and then checking if there is enough space left on these screens to fit the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

However, there are a few issues with the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Calculation of `t` for 2x2 Icons**: The initial calculation of `t` as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, is incorrect. This calculation assumes that each 2x2 icon requires at least half a screen, which is not true. A single screen can fit up to 3 2x2 icons (since 5x3 grid can fit 3 non-overlapping 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculation of Remaining Space (`t1`)**: The calculation of `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4` is also incorrect. This formula assumes that each screen has 15 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons, which is not accurate. Each screen has 15 cells in total, but the placement of 2x2 icons affects the available space for 1x1 icons differently.

3. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**: The logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`) is also flawed. The program should correctly account for the actual space left on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons and then calculate the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
