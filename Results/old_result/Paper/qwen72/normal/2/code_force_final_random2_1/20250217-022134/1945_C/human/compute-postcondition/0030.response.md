Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list containing the value `[1]` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `zero_perc` is now calculated based on the current value of `zero` and `i`.
- The conditions for updating `lst` remain the same, depending on the new value of `zero_perc` and the existing value of `one_perc`.
