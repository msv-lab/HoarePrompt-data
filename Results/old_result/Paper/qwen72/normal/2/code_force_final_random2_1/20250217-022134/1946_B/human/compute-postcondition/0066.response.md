The value of `t` is multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`), `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0.
