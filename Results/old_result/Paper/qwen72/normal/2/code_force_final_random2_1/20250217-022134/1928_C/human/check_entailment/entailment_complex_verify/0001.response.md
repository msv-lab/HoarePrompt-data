### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding all possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya standing at position \( n \) receives the number \( x \) according to the given pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, alternating between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( k \), the sequence of numbers assigned to positions can be described as:
     - Positions \( 1 \) to \( k \): \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \)
     - Positions \( k+1 \) to \( 2k-2 \): \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \)
     - This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern described above.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If \( n \) is within the first \( k \) positions, \( x \) should be \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is within the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( x \) should be \( k - (n - k) \).
   - This can be generalized to:
     - \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k-2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k - x \pmod{2k-2} \).

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with arguments \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1` with arguments \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of \( q \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \). If so, it adds both \( i \) and \( q // i \) to \( M \) if they are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It returns the list \( M \).

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( y \) is odd.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The program combines the results and removes duplicates before printing the final count.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
