The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns `t` to itself, which means `t` retains its original value. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
