The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c` being less than `casos`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `casos` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `c` is 2), and `casos` must still be greater than `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. For any other value of `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, including 2, the state also remains unchanged.**
