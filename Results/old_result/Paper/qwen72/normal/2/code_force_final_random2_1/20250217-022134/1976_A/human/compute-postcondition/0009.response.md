The code `digits.append(char)` adds the current character `char` to the list `digits`. Given the initial state, if `char` is a digit, it will be added to the `digits` list, which already contains the previous `char`. If `char` is not a digit, the code would not be executed according to the given condition, and the state would remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the next character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the previous `char` and the new `char`, and `letters` remains an empty list. If the next character `char` is not a digit, `digits` remains a list containing the previous `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the new `char`.**
