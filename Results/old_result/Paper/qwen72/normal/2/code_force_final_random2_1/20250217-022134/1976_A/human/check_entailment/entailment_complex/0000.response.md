Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Character Separation**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters. This is done correctly using the `isdigit()` method.

3. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - **Digits Sorting**: The digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to ensure that the digits in the password are in the correct order.
   - **Letters Sorting**: The letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to ensure that the letters in the password are in the correct order.
   - **Order Validation**: The function checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and if no digit appears after a letter. This is done by comparing the last digit with each letter and ensuring that the digits are in the correct order.

4. **Final Comparison**: The function constructs a new string by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares it with the original password. If they match, the password is considered strong; otherwise, it is not.

However, there is a potential issue in the validation logic:
- The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is intended to check if any digit is greater than any letter. However, this condition is not entirely correct because it only checks the last digit against all letters, which might not cover all cases where a digit appears after a letter.

To fix this, we need to ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password. This can be done by checking the positions of digits and letters in the original password.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if any digit appears after a letter
    last_letter_index = -1
    for i, char in enumerate(password):
        if char.isalpha():
            last_letter_index = i
        elif last_letter_index != -1 and i > last_letter_index:
            return False
    
    # Sort digits and letters
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if digits and letters are in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):
        if digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
    for i in range(len(letters) - 1):
        if letters[i] > letters[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Construct the sorted password and compare
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

Given the original function and the reasoning above, the original function is **not** fully correct due to the issue with the validation logic for digits appearing after letters.

Correctness: **False**
