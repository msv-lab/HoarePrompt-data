Postcondition: ***`val` must contain at least one tuple, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
