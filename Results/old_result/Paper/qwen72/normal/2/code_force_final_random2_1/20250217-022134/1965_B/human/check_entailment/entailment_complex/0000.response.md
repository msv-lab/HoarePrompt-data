### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` is initialized with the first 21 powers of 2, which ensures that it covers a wide range of possible values and can form many different sums.

2. **Finding the Index `idx`:**
   - The loop iterates through `nums` to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is stored in `idx`.

3. **Modifying `nums`:**
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{\text{idx}}\)) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are appended to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums` because the element `nums[idx]` is removed.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums` because it is greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums` because it is greater than `k` and also ensures that other sums can be formed.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - By removing `1 << idx` and appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums`.

- **Condition 2:** For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The initial list of powers of 2 can form many different sums. By modifying `nums` as described, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can still be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `a` that meets the given conditions for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
