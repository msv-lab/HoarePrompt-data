Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is the original input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the last input string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. If `len(a) > 1`, `b` is a string containing the characters of the last input string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the last input string `s` sorted in descending order. If the last input string `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`, and `b` is now a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of up to 1000 test cases, where each test case involves a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order (if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order). After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
