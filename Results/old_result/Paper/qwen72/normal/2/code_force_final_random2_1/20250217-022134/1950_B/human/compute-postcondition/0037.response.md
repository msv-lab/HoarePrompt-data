Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The conditions for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) remain unchanged, and the other variables (`t`, `casos`, and `c`) are not affected by this code snippet.
