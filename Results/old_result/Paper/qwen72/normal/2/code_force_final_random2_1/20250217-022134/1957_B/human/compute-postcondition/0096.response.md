The code `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the difference between `k` and the sum of the current elements in `ans` to the list `ans`.

- `ans` initially contains the value \((1 << i) - 1\).
- The sum of the elements in `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\).
- The new element appended to `ans` is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will contain two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is a list containing \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.**
