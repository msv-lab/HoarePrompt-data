The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written out immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables or alter the state of the program beyond ensuring that any pending output is processed.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
