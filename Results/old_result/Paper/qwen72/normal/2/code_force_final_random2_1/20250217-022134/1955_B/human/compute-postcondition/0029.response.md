The code snippet `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. However, the initial state mentions a list `li` which is already sorted in ascending order. Since there is no variable `l` mentioned in the initial state, it's unclear what `l` refers to. Assuming `l` is a typo and should be `li`, the sorting operation would not change the state of `li` because it is already sorted.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that the list `li` is explicitly noted to remain sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `k` is `n`, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `n^2` elements, where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` is now sorted in ascending order.**
