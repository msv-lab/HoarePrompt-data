The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` being less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `T` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2`**
