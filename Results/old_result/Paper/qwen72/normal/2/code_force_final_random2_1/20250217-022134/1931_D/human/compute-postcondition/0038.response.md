Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.** 

Explanation: The value of `required_mod_y` is now set to the value of `mod_y`. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
