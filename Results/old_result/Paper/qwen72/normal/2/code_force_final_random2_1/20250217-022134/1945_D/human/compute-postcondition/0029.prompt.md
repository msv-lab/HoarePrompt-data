Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n` where each element is in the range [1, 10^9], `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k):
    if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
        pref += soma_b
        pref += lista_A[i]
        soma_b = 0
    else:
        soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is equal to the first element of `lista_B` and `pref` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and the second element of `lista_A`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of the first element of `lista_B` and `lista_B[1]`, and `pref` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[2] < lista_B[2]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and `lista_A[2]`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of its previous value and `lista_B[2]`, and `pref` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
