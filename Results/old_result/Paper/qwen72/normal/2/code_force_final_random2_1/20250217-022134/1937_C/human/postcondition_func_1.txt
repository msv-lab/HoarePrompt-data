The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be within the range 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is the length of some permutation `p`. It prints the string `! a b` to the standard output, where `a` and `b` are the provided integers. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integers `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the only observable effect is the printed output.
