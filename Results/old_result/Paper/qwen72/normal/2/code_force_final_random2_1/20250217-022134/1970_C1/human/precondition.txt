The function `testcase` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input data that includes: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and t (t=1) indicating the number of rounds. The following n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing edges of the tree, ensuring the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.
