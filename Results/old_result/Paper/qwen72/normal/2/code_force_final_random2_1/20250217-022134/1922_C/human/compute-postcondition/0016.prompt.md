Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and a list of `m` pairs `(x_i, y_i)` where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `b` is a list `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v, v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is updated to `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, 2v]` if `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + 1]` if `v > x - w` and `v <= z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, 2v]` if `v <= x - w` and `v > z - y`, `[0, 0, v, v, v + 1, v + 1]` if `v <= x - w` and `v <= z - y`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the first element of `a`, `x` is the second element of `a`, `y` is the third element of `a`, `z` is the fourth element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
