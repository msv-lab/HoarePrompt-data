Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, Bob can take all the items for free if Alice buys any. Therefore, Alice's profit should be 0 in this case because Bob will take all the items for free, and Alice will not gain any profit from selling them to Bob.

However, the program does not account for this scenario properly. It still attempts to push items into the heap and calculate profits, which can lead to incorrect results.

Example Input:
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

This shows that the program does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
