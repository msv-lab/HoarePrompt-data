The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given the initial values of `x` and `y` (both 1 and 2 respectively), the expressions simplify to:

- `n // ((1 + 2) * 1)` which is `n // 3`
- `m // ((1 + 2) * 2)` which is `m // 6`

So, `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n // 3` and `m // 6`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 2, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 1 + min(`n` // 3, `m` // 6)**
