The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is `n` and `h` is `n` (since `h` was initially set to `n` and has not been changed). Therefore, the new element appended to `li` is `a + n * c + d * n`.

Since `li` initially had `2 * n + 1` elements, after appending one more element, `li` now has `2 * n + 2` elements.

The structure of `li` remains the same, with the first `n` elements being `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements being the same, and the last element before the append being `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`. After the append, the last element is `a + n * c + d * n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n`, `li` has `2 * n + 2` elements, where the first `n` elements are `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are also `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the second-to-last element is `a + k * c + d * (n-1)`, and the last element is `a + n * c + d * n`, `k` is `n`.**
