Output State: **`zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The value of `zeroInd` remains the same as it was initially calculated. The value of `ans[i]` is updated to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
