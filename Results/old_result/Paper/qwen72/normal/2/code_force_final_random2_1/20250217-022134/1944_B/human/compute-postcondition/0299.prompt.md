Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n` (indicating the loop has completed its full range), `k` will be `req - n` where `n` is the length of `l`, and `ans2` will contain the first `min(n, req)` elements of `l`, each appended once. The values of `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` remains the same, `k` is `k - len(l)`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains elements from `c` that were repeated twice based on the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` and also includes all elements of `l`, `q` remains `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks early, and `ans1` and `ans2` will contain only the elements processed up to that point.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `len(l)` is the number of unique elements in `b` (excluding the last element if it's the same as the second-to-last element), `k` is `req` minus twice the number of consecutive identical pairs found in `c` minus the number of elements in `l`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l` appended to its existing elements, which includes the last element of `b` twice if `b[n-2] == b[n-1]` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found during the loop, `ans2` contains all elements of `l` appended to its existing elements, and `q`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop breaks early.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
