The function `func` reads from an input source (likely stdin or a file), processing every other line starting from the third line. Each processed line represents a test case containing a sequence of integers (card numbers). For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique card number by 3, and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the input source is fully read, and the function has printed a result for each test case. The function does not return any value.
