Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0 if `combined` is empty, otherwise `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, if `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter.***
