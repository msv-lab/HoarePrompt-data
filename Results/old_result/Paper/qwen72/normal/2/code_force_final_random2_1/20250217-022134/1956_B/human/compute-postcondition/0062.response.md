The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints provided for the problem. It processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a set of cards distributed among players. Each player receives `n` cards, and the numbers on the cards (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are integers ranging from 1 to `n`, with each integer appearing at most twice. The function evaluates the distribution of these cards across the test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cards distributed among players. For each test case, it takes the number of cards each player receives (n) and the numbers on the cards (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) as implicit inputs. It returns the result of evaluating the card distribution for each test case, adhering to the constraints that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence.**
