The value of `c` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. Since `c` was initially the sum of the first and second integers in the list `l`, and `x` is the third integer in the list `l`, the new value of `c` is the sum of the first, second, and third integers in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of the first, second, and third integers in the list `l`, `x` is the third integer in the list `l`, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than 2.**
