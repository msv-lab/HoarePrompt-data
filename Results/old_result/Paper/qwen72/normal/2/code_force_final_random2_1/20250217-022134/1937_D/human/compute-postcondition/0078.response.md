Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains an additional element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `ans[i]` is calculated using the given formula, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are derived from the existing lists `suffZero` and `preOne`, respectively.
- The updated value of `ans[i]` is stored in the list `ans` at the index `i`.
