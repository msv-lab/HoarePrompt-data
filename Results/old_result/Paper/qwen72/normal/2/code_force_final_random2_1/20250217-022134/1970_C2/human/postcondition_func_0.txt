The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree structure, an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an optional integer `parent` representing the parent node (defaulting to `None`). It returns `False` if the starting node has only one adjacent node, and that node is the parent. Otherwise, it recursively checks the adjacent nodes of the starting node (excluding the parent node) and returns `True` if at least one of these adjacent nodes does not satisfy the same condition when the function is called recursively. If all adjacent nodes satisfy the condition, it returns `False`.
