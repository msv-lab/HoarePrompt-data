You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and each of the t test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is `t-1`, `a` is a new input string with 5 characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, and `h` is the number of 'B's in `a`. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`. Otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` ≤ `h`. Each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', all `t` strings are distinct.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is done using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, the program reads a string `a` of length 5. This is done using a loop `for i in range(t)`.

3. **Counting Characters**: Inside the loop, the program initializes two counters `l` and `h` to zero. These counters will keep track of the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string, respectively.

4. **Character Comparison**: The program then iterates over each character in the string `a` using another loop `for j in a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l` by 1. If the character is 'B', it increments `h` by 1.

5. **Determine Most Frequent Character**: After counting the characters, the program checks which counter is greater. If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the most frequent character for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case individually.
- The logic for counting the characters and determining the most frequent one is straightforward and correct.
- The program ensures that it prints the correct character ('A' or 'B') based on the counts.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
