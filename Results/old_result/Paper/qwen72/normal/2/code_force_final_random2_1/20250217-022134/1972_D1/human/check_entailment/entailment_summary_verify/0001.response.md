### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The commented-out code block is not executed and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, it seems to be an approximation and might not always be accurate.
   - Specifically, the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not directly account for the gcd condition. It appears to be a heuristic that might work in some cases but not in others.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) correctly.
   - However, the final result is `suma - 1`, which might be incorrect if there are no valid pairs for some \(i\).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output for the given test cases should match the expected results. However, the formula used might not always produce the correct count.
   - For example, in the test case with \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14, but the program might not produce this result due to the heuristic nature of the formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the complexity of the problem and the specific formula used, it is clear that the program has logical issues and might not always produce the correct results. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is not a reliable method to count the valid pairs, and the subtraction of 1 at the end might introduce additional errors.

Final: **False**
