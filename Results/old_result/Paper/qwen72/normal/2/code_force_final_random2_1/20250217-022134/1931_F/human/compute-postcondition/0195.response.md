Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `1` is equal to `n - 3`, `i` is incremented by 1, `idx2` is equal to `i`. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `1` equals `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `p2` is set to 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The condition involving `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` now uses `1` instead of the previous value of `p2`.
- The updated condition is: the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `1` is equal to `n - 3`.
- If this sum equals `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
