#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program encounters an error because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the program does not return any values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to take two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be tuples or lists containing two integers. However, due to an error in the code where `b` is incorrectly treated as a single integer instead of a tuple or list, the function fails to execute correctly and does not return any values. As a result, the function does not modify the state of the program or produce any output.
