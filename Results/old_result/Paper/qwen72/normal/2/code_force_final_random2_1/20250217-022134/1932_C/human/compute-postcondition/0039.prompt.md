You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, and `r` is `-1`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is selected from `a` based on the corresponding character in `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed list `b`. Each element in `b` is selected from the list `a` based on the corresponding character in the string `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` is calculated as the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It returns a list `ans` which is the reversed list of cumulative products of elements selected from `a` based on the instructions in `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the reversed list `b`. Each element in `b` is selected from the list `a` based on the corresponding character in the string `s` ('L' means taking from the left end of `a`, 'R' means taking from the right end of `a'). The final list `ans` is calculated as the cumulative products of these elements in reverse order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
