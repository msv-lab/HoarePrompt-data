You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    1

    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively. It then prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and no further actions are performed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic `print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)` is flawed. This logic suggests that if the number of islands minus the number of bridges destroyed is less than or equal to 1, then the result is `n` (the total number of islands), otherwise, the result is `1`. This does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of islands Everule can visit.

A correct approach would involve understanding that Dominater can isolate Everule's island (island 1) from the rest of the islands by destroying the minimum number of bridges necessary to disconnect island 1 from the others. The correct logic should consider the following:

1. If `k` is 0, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it, so Everule can only visit 1 island.
3. If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges, but Everule will still be able to visit `n - k` islands, including island 1.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - k)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
