You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, inclusive. For each set, it determines a string `res` based on the relationship between x, y, and z: if x < y and y > z, `res` is 'peak'; if x < y and y < z, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of digits followed by the corresponding `res` string. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The final state is that `i` is 1001, and the program has printed 1000 lines of digit sets and their corresponding results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Random Input Generation**: The program generates random inputs using `randint`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to read inputs from standard input. This means the program will not work as expected when given specific test cases.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x == y` or `y == z`. For example, if `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`, the program will incorrectly output "none" instead of "NONE".

3. **Incorrect Logic for "STAIR" and "PEAK" Conditions**:
   - The program checks `if x < y` and then further checks `if y > z` or `if y < z`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `x < y < z` (which should be "STAIR") and `x < y > z` (which should be "PEAK").
   - The program also does not correctly handle the case where `x > y` or `x == y`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the result in lowercase ("peak", "stair", "none"), whereas the problem description requires the output to be in uppercase ("PEAK", "STAIR", "NONE").

Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
def solve(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a < b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b, c))
```

This version reads the input as specified, handles all edge cases correctly, and outputs the results in the required format.
