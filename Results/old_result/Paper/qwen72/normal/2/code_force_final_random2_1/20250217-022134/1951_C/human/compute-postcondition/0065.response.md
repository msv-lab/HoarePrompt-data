The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is `s + s`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + s)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
