Output State: **`val` must contain at least one more tuple, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged, but the control flow of the program is altered to exit the loop or if statement.
