Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such element exists.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `nums`, which contains powers of 2.
- The loop stops when it finds the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
- If such an element is found, `idx` is set to the index of the previous element (which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`), and the loop breaks.
- If no such element is found, `idx` remains -1, and `i` will be the length of `nums` (since the loop completes without breaking).
- The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
