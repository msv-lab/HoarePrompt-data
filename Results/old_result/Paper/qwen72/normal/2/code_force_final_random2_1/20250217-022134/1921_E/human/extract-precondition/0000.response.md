Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.**
