Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers read from the input respectively, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers read from the input, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The constraints on `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) are still valid after the update.
