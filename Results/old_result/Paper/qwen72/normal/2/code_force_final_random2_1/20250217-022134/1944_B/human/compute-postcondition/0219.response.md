Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(l) - 1`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is either `[b[0], b[n - 1]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or `[b[n - 1]]` if `l` was initially empty, and `k` is `2 * (k - len(l))`. If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `k` is `2 * (k - len(l)) - 2`, and `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice. In both cases, `n` is the first integer input, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` and is now sorted, `c` is now the slice of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is sorted in ascending order, and `req` is `2 * (k - len(l))`.***
