To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state, the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of these variables or conditions directly.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
