Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` now contains [1], `lex` remains unchanged.** 

The value 1 has been appended to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
