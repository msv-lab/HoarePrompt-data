Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 8, and `dp[4]` which is 26; `k` is 0; `i` is 4; `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop; `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 4; `n` is the first input integer; `t` is decreased by 1; `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged; `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[4]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the known values: `(8 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- This simplifies to `(8 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `26 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, resulting in `26`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
