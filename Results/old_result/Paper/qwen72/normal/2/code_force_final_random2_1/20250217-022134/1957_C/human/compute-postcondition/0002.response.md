The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, representing the number of remaining test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
