Based on the initial state provided:

- `l22` is a list derived from `l2` but excludes `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `m` is equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than the number of iterations.
- `idx1` is not -1.
- If `idx2` is -1, it is set to `n - 2`.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply prints the string `'yes'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed directly; the statement just outputs a fixed string.

Output: **yes**
