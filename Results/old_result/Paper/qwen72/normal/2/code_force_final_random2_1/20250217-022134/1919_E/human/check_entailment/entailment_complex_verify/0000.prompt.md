You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

    #State: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). The list `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1`, where each element has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, starting from the initial state where `dp[n]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, the loop updates `dp` such that for each index `j` in the range [0, 2 * n], if `dp[j]` was greater than 0 at any point, the adjacent elements `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. After `n` iterations, the final state of `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of these updates. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it is overwritten in each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `p` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but assumed to be part of the context leading to `final_sum`), and `offset` is a value that is also not explicitly defined but is part of the calculation for `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements have been updated according to certain loop rules, which are not detailed here. The exact value returned depends on the specific values of `p[-1]`, `offset`, and the updates made to `dp` during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array `a`. It initializes a list `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index `n` (the `offset`), which is set to 1. The function then iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` list based on the values of the current `dp` list and the modulo operation with a constant `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function calculates `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and the `offset`. The function returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` list. The final state of the program includes the updated `dp` list and the returned value, which represents the result of the dynamic programming process applied to the input parameters.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, then calling another function `func_1` with `n` and `p`. The results of these calls are collected and printed one by one. After the function completes, the input data remains unchanged, and the results of the test cases are printed to the standard output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `func_1` function initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices so that negative sums can be represented in the DP array.

2. **DP Transition**: The DP transition is handled correctly. For each element in the array `a`, the program updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums that can be achieved by adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum. This is done using the `new_dp` array, which is updated based on the current `dp` values.

3. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`. The result is then retrieved from the `dp` array at the corresponding index.

4. **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases correctly. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs up to the constraints (`n = 5000`). It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` has repeated values or negative values.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
