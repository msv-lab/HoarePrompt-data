Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. **`mak`**: This is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, it is described as the largest such integer.
3. **`mak2`**: This is also the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. Given that `mak` and `mak2` are both described in the same way, they should have the same value.
4. **`i`**: This is explicitly set to 0.
5. **`mak2`**: This is the same as the second value, so it will be the same as `mak`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order. Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the output will include the same value twice.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`)**
