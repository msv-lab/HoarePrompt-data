Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input line, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is 0, and the second element of `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
