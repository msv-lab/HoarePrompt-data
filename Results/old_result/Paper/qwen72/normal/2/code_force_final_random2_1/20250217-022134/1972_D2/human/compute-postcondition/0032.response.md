To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 3
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.
   - If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`.
   - `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18` must be less than or equal to `n`.
     - `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18` must be less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both `n` and `m` must be at least 18.
   - Since `n` and `m` are already given to be at least 15 and 10 respectively, they need to be adjusted to ensure they are at least 18.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustments needed are to ensure that `n` and `m` are at least 18. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`. `n` must be at least 18, and `m` must be at least 18.**
