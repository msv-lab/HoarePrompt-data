Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string `a`.
- `h` is the number of 'B's in the input string `a`.
- Each of the `t` test cases contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct.
- The number of 'A's (`l`) in the input string `a` is greater than the number of 'B's (`h`).

The print statement is:
```python
print('A')
```

This statement simply prints the character 'A'. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it directly prints a constant string 'A'.

Output: **A**
