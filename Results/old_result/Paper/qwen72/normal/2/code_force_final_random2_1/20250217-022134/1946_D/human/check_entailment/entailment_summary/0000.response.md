### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_3` to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_1` is used to read the array `a` of integers.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - The function `func_5` processes each test case by iterating over the bits from 29 to 0.
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks the bit in `x` and the sum of the bits in the array `a` at that position.
   - Depending on the values of these bits, it performs different operations:
     - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum of the bits in `a` is 0, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum of the bits in `a` is odd, it returns `ans`.
     - If the bit in `x` is 0 and the sum of the bits in `a` is even, it processes the array to find segments where the XOR of the bits is 0 and updates `t` and `ai`.
     - If the bit in `x` is 1 and the sum of the bits in `a` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the bit in `x` is 1 and the sum of the bits in `a` is even, it counts the number of segments where the XOR of the bits is 0 and updates `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the processed array `a`.

3. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The function ensures that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the selected segments does not exceed `x`.
   - The function also correctly handles the edge cases where no valid segments can be found, returning -1.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
