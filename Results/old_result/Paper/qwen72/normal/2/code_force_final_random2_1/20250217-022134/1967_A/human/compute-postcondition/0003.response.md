The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.**
