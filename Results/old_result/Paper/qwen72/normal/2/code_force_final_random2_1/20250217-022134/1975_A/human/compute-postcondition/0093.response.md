The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether all elements in the `new` list are in non-decreasing order. The condition checks each pair of consecutive elements in `new` to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1
- `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `new_all` is updated based on the condition that all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Calculation:
- The list comprehension iterates over the indices of `new` from 1 to `len(new) - 1`.
- For each index `i`, it checks if `new[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `new[i]`.
- If all these conditions are true, `new_all` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
