Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2 ** (k - 1))) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 ** k - 2) * t) % MOD`, `i` is `k - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the standard input.
- **`_`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: Remain unchanged as they are read from the standard input.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is read from the standard input.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged as it is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- **`t`**: After `k - 1` iterations, `t` is multiplied by 2 each time and then taken modulo `MOD`. Therefore, `t` becomes `(t * (2 ** (k - 1))) % MOD`.
- **`tmp`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: Initially, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. In each iteration, `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, and `ans` is taken modulo `MOD`. After `k - 1` iterations, the total addition to `ans` is `(2 ** k - 2) * t` (since the sum of a geometric series `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(k-2)` is `2^(k-1) - 1`). Therefore, `ans` becomes `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 ** k - 2) * t) % MOD`.
- **`i`**: After `k - 1` iterations, `i` is `k - 1`.
