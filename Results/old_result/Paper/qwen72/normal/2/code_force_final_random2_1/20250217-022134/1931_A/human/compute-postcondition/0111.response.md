The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, and the content of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
   - `cases` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.
   - If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1], and `lex` is the input integer minus 1.
   - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26).
   - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between 26 and 52).
   - If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`.
   - Depending on the initial value of `lex`, `arr` could be one of the following:
     - If `lex` < 28, `arr` was initially [1], so after appending 26, `arr` becomes [1, 26].
     - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` was initially [26], so after appending 26, `arr` becomes [26, 26].
     - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` was initially [26], so after appending 26, `arr` becomes [26, 26].
     - If `lex` > 78, `arr` was initially an empty list [], so after appending 26, `arr` becomes [26].

3. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
   - `cases` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.
   - If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 26], and `lex` is the input integer minus 1.
   - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26], and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26).
   - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26], and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between 26 and 52).
   - If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 26], and `lex` is the input integer minus 1. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26], and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which is between -24 and 26). If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26], and `lex` is `lex - 26` (which is between 26 and 52). If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is the input integer.**
