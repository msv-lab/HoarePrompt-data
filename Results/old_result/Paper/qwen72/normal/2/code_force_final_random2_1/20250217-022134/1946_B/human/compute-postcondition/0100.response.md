Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least three elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp, 0))`, `i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`, if `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`. If `tmp` < 0, `t` is set to 0, and `ans` is `((s + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (0 * (k-1)) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding the value of `x` to it.
- `x` is the third element in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `i`, `t`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on the updated `tmp`.
- If `tmp` is less than 0 after the addition, it will be set to 0, which affects the value of `t` and subsequently `ans`.
- The conditions and constraints on the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
