To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the conditions in the loop head:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Given the current state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 20
- `m` is greater than or equal to 5
- `x` is 4
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` remains unchanged

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the conditions:

1. `(4 + 3) * 4 <= n` simplifies to `7 * 4 <= n` which is `28 <= n`.
2. `(4 + 3) * 3 <= m` simplifies to `7 * 3 <= m` which is `21 <= m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true. Given the current state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 20, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 28.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 5, but for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 21.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 28.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 21.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 28, `m` is greater than or equal to 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged**
