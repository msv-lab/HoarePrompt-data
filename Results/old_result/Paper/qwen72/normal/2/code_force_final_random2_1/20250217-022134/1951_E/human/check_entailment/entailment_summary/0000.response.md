### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - **`func_2(ch)`**: This function determines a strategy for partitioning the string based on its length and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`, where `b` is half the length of `ch`. It returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) indicating the partitioning strategy.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It first checks if the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (`s == s[0] * len(s)`). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because such a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it uses `func_1` to check if the entire string `s` is a palindrome. If it is, and the length is greater than 3, it uses `func_2` to determine the partitioning strategy.
   - Depending on the value returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string consists of the same character repeated.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string is a palindrome and needs to be partitioned.
   - The partitioning logic seems to cover various cases, including even and odd lengths of the string.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output format.
