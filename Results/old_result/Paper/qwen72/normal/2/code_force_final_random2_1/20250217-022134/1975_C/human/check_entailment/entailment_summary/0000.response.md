Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum possible value that all elements in the array can be changed to using the specified operations. The key insight is that the maximum value that can be achieved is the maximum of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the array. This is because any chosen subarray's median will be at least as large as the smaller of the two adjacent elements, and thus, the smallest element in the subarray can propagate through the array.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `max` to 0.
4. It iterates through the array, comparing each pair of consecutive elements and updating `max` with the larger of the minimums of these pairs.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `max`.

This approach ensures that the program finds the maximum value that can be achieved by the operations described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.
