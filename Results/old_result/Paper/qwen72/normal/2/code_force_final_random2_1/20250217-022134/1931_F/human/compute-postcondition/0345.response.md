Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `m` is exactly 2.
   - `val` is an empty list.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` and `m` are updated to integers provided by user input.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the user input.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input.
   - `a2` is the first integer from the new user input.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input.
   - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`.
   - Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were initially, which could be either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.
   - `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the final state:

- The conditions imply that `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the same index.
- Since `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, it means `idx1` must be equal to `idx2`.
- If `idx2` is set to `n - 2` when `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` must also be `n - 2`.

The `print('yes')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **yes**
