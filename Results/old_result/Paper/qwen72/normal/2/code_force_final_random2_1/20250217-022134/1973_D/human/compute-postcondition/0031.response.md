The value of `l` is updated to the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, the new value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
