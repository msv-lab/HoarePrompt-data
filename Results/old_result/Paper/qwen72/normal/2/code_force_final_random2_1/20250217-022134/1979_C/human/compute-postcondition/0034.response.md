To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bets` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bets`: This variable retains its initial value throughout the loop.
   - `i`: This variable is set to `bets - 1`.
   - `ans`: This is a string that concatenates the string representations of the elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, separated by spaces.

3. **Constructing the Output:**
   - Since `ans` is constructed by joining the string representations of the elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, the output will be a space-separated string of these elements.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the string `ans` as described. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **"a[0] a[1] ... a[bets-1]" (where a[0], a[1], ..., a[bets-1] are the elements of the list a from index 0 to bets - 1, separated by spaces)**
