Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all the integers `y` such that `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` were read as pairs during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged, `L` is now 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which results in 50001. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
