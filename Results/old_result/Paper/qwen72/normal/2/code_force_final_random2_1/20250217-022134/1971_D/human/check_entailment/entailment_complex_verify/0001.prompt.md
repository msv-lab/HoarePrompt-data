You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single parameter, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500 characters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `s` remains the final input string provided during the last iteration, `t` is the original input integer, `i` is equal to `t` (indicating the loop has run `t` times), `j` is `len(s) - 1` (indicating the last position checked in the string `s`), and `count` is the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` across all iterations. If `flag` is True, it indicates there was at least one instance where `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1' during the loop, and `count` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` binary strings (each consisting of '0's and '1's). For each binary string, it calculates the number of transitions between different characters ('0' to '1' or '1' to '0'). If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', the count is decremented by 1. The function prints the adjusted count for each binary string. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and the final binary string `s` in their respective states, and the loop counters `i` and `j` reflecting the completion of the loops.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop with index `j`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j+1]`, it increments `count`.
   - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies transitions between different characters.
   - It correctly handles the special case where a transition from '0' to '1' occurs, ensuring that the count is adjusted appropriately.
   - The logic ensures that the minimum number of pieces is calculated by counting the transitions and adjusting for the '0' to '1' transition.

4. **Testing with Examples:**
   - For `s = "11010"`, the transitions are at positions 2 and 4, and there is a '0' to '1' transition, so the output is `3`.
   - For `s = "00000000"`, there are no transitions, so the output is `1`.
   - For `s = "1"`, there are no transitions, so the output is `1`.
   - For `s = "10"`, there is one transition, and it is a '0' to '1' transition, so the output is `2`.
   - For `s = "0001111"`, there is one transition, but it is not a '0' to '1' transition, so the output is `1`.
   - For `s = "0110"`, the transitions are at positions 1 and 3, and there is a '0' to '1' transition, so the output is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.
