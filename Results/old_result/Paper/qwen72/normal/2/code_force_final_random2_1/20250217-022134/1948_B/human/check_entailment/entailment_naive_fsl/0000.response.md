Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of splitting elements into multiple digits and then checking if the resulting array can be sorted. The program only checks if the immediate next element is smaller and tries to split the previous element, but it does not recursively check the entire array after each split.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  12 28 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the array cannot be sorted by splitting the elements. After splitting `28` into `[2, 8]`, the array becomes `[12, 2, 8, 5]`, which still cannot be sorted. However, the program does not detect this and incorrectly concludes that the array can be sorted.
