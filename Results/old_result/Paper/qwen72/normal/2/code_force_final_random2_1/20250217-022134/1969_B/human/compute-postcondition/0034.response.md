Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s` and is currently 0, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]`, and `ans` is 0.**
