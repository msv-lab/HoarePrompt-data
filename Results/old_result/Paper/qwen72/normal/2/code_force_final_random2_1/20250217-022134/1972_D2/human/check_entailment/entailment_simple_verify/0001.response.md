### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `x` starts at 1 and iterates up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
     - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the valid pairs.
   - **Inner Loop**:
     - For each `x`, `y` starts at 1 and iterates while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
     - If the gcd condition is met, the number of valid pairs is incremented by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).
   - **Output**:
     - The count of valid pairs is printed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The gcd condition ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are in the simplest form.
   - The loop bounds ensure that \(a\) and \(b\) do not exceed \(n\) and \(m\) respectively.
   - The use of `min` ensures that the count does not exceed the limits of \(n\) and \(m\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where \(n\) or \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)).
   - The algorithm also handles large values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State Before Function Calls**:
  - `func_2` is called with `t` test cases.
  - Each test case calls `func_1` with `n` and `m` as inputs.
- **State After Function Calls**:
  - `func_1` correctly processes each test case and prints the count of valid pairs.
  - The final state after all test cases is that `func_1` has been called `t` times, and the results are printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic and implementation are sound and handle the constraints effectively. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
