Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-2`, where `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is 0, but the current value of `k` is not 0.
   - `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
   - `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation performed.
   - `y` is the number of elements remaining in the list `a` after the loop has processed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `n` is an input integer, so it is a known value.
   - `i` is `n-2`, which is also a known value based on `n`.
   - `k` is not 0, but its exact value is not specified. Let's denote it as `k`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. The length of `a` is `n`.
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n-1] + k // n`. Here, `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`, and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

4. **Calculating `r`:**
   - `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.
   - Therefore, `r = a[n-1] + k // n`.

5. **Calculating the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substituting `r` with `a[n-1] + k // n`, we get:
     \[
     (a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     (a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 = (a[n-1] * n + k // n * n - n) + 1 = a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is the result of the expression `a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1`.

Given the initial state and the steps above, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[n-1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is the current value of k, and n is the input integer)**
