The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f` as integers. This operation updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `f`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `2 * f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.** 

In natural language: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` are now assigned new values from the input, which are integers.
