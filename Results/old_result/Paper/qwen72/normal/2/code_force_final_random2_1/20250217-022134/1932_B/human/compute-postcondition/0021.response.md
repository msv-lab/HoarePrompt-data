Output State: **`t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 6 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 7, `results` is a list containing two results of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 6 to 7.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
