Postcondition: ***`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.***
