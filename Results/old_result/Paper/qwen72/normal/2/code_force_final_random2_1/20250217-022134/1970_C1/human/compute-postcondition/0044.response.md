The code snippet provided does not change the value of `empty` since it is already set to `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the only thing to note is that no other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`.**
