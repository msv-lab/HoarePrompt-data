### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29. This is correct because the maximum value of `x` is less than \(2^{30}\), so 30 bits are sufficient.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function uses a flag to handle the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.
   - It iterates through the binary representation and adjusts the values to ensure that if two consecutive '1's are found, the first one is changed to '-1' and a carry is set.
   - If a carry is set and the next bit is '0', it is changed to '1' and the carry is reset.
   - If the carry reaches the last bit, it is handled appropriately by either setting the last bit to '1' or appending an additional '1' to the list.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the initial adjustments, the function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any remaining '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'.
   - This step is crucial to ensure that the final array meets the constraint of no two consecutive non-zero elements.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Binary Conversion**:
  - The loop that converts `x` to its binary representation is correct. Each bit is checked, and '1' or '0' is appended to the list `s` accordingly.

- **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
  - The flag mechanism is used to handle consecutive '1's. When two consecutive '1's are found, the first one is changed to '-1', and a carry is set.
  - The carry is then propagated through the list, changing '0's to '1's and resetting the carry when necessary.
  - This ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the final list.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final loop ensures that any remaining '-1' followed by '1' is adjusted to '0' and '-1'. This step is necessary to meet the constraint of no two consecutive non-zero elements.

- **Output**:
  - The length of the resulting array is printed, followed by the array itself. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the required output. The logic and steps are well-structured and ensure that the final array meets all the specified conditions.

Final: **True**
