The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `sz` will be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to 1, `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
