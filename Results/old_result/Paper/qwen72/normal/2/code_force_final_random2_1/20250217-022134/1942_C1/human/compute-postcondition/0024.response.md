To determine what will be printed by the `print(count + x - 2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
   - `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).
   - `y` is an integer.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.
   - `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
   - If `num` is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
   - `i` is `x - 2`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `count + x - 2` involves adding `count` to `x - 2`.
   - `x - 2` is the value of `i`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The value of `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
   - The value of `i` is `x - 2`.
   - Therefore, the expression `count + x - 2` simplifies to `count + i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(count + x - 2)` statement will print the sum of `count` and `i`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the sum of `count` and `x - 2`.

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in list0 is exactly 1, and x is the length of list0)**
