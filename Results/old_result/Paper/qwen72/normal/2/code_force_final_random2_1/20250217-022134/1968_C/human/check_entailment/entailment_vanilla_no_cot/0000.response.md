Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Specifically, the logic used in the loop to compute the elements of `a` is flawed.

Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The initial value of `a[0]` is set to 1000, which is arbitrary and may not satisfy the condition for the first element.
- The loop updates `a` by subtracting `T[i-1]` from the previous element, which does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

A correct approach would be to start with a sufficiently large value for `a_1` and then compute subsequent values of `a` such that the modulo condition is satisfied. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize a_1 to a value larger than the maximum possible x_i
        a = [max(x) + 1]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[-1] + x[i])
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- `a_1` is set to a value greater than any `x_i`, ensuring that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2`.
- Each subsequent `a_i` is computed as `a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`, ensuring that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

This approach guarantees that the conditions are met for all test cases.
