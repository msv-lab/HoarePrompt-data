Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the `func_1` function. The function does not properly enforce the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds 1 to each element in the row and then finds the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d+1`, which does not guarantee that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initial Incrementation**:
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1. This is correct because the first `d-1` elements must have supports, and the cost of placing a support is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Sliding Window Calculation**:
   - The second loop updates each element in the row from index `d-1` to the end. It sets each element to the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements plus the original value of the current element plus 1. This approach does not ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint.

### Counterexample Verification:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 5 1 2
  0 1 100 1 0
  ```
- The river grid is:
  ```
  0 1 100 1 0
  ```
- The maximum distance between supports is `2`.

According to the problem description, the valid positions for supports are:
- (1, 1) and (1, 5) (required by the problem)
- (1, 3) (since the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) is 1, and the distance between (1, 3) and (1, 5) is also 1)

The current implementation of `func_1` will calculate the cost as follows:
- `row[0] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 1))
- `row[1] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 2))
- `row[2] = 101` (cost of placing a support at (1, 3))
- `row[3] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 4))
- `row[4] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 5))

The function will return `1 + 2 + 101 + 2 + 1 = 107`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the valid placement of supports according to the distance constraint.

The correct minimum cost should be `1 + 101 + 1 = 103` (placing supports at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5)).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the distance constraint, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

Final: **False**
