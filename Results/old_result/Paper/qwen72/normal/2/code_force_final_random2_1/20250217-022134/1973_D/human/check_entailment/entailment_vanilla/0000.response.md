### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and its maximum value equal to \( m \).
   - We can make up to \( 2n \) queries to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function Definitions:**
     - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4` are helper functions for reading input.
     - `func_5` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

3. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) from input.
     - Initializes \( v \) to 1.
   - **Finding the Maximum Value \( v \):**
     - Iterates from \( n \) down to 1, querying \( f(1, i \times n) \).
     - If the response \( v \) equals \( n \), sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Possible Values for \( m \):**
     - Iterates over possible values of \( i \) from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \).
     - For each \( i \), initializes \( cnt \) to \( k \) and \( l \) to 1.
     - While \( cnt \) is greater than 0 and \( l \) is less than \( n + 1 \):
       - Queries \( f(l, i \times v) \).
       - Updates \( l \) to the response plus 1 and decrements \( cnt \).
     - If \( cnt \) reaches 0 and \( l \) equals \( n + 1 \), prints \( i \times v \) as the answer and returns.
   - **No Valid \( m \) Found:**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found, prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses the correct number of queries to find the maximum value \( v \).
   - It checks all possible values for \( m \) and ensures that the subarrays meet the required conditions.
   - The logic for determining the largest \( m \) and handling the interaction with the judge is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
