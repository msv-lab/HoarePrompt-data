To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is an integer read from the standard input, where \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is set to 2 (this variable is not used in the subsequent calculations).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, with \(k > 0\).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` is calculated as \(((2 \times (\text{the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in } a)) \% \text{MOD}) \times (2^{(k-1)}) \% \text{MOD}\).
   - `i` is set to 0 (this variable is not used in the subsequent calculations).
   - `ans` is calculated as \((((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + (t \times (2^{(k-1)} - 1)) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD}\).

2. **Calculations:**
   - **Sum of Elements (`s`):**
     - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

   - **Maximum Subarray Sum of Non-Negative Contiguous Subarrays:**
     - This is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` that contains only non-negative numbers. Let's denote this value as `max_subarray_sum`.

   - **Calculation of `t`:**
     - `t = ((2 * max_subarray_sum) % MOD) * (2^(k-1)) % MOD`
     - Here, `MOD` is a constant (typically \(10^9 + 7\) in competitive programming problems).

   - **Calculation of `ans`:**
     - `ans = (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above.

Given the complexity and the need for precise values, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `T`, `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the calculation described above)**
