Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3 if the first element of `a` (`sz`) is 1, otherwise `mexsize` is updated to 2.***
