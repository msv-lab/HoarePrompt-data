The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and the current value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least one element
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is 0
- `i` is `k-1`
- If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` is updated to the maximum of `tmp` and its current value (which is 0).

Since `t` was initially 0, the new value of `t` will be:
- `t` = `max(tmp, 0)`

If `tmp` is non-negative, `t` will be set to `tmp`.
If `tmp` is negative, `t` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least one element
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`
- `i` is `k-1`
- If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `i` is `k-1`, if `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0, and `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`.**
