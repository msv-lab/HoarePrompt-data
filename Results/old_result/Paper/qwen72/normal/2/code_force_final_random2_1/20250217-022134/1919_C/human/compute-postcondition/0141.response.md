Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 3`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.***
