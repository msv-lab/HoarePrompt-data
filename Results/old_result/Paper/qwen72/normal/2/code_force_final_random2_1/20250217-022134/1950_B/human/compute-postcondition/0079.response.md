The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Output: **..##..##**
