The function reads an integer `cases` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) representing an encoded value of a three-letter word. It processes `lex` to determine the corresponding three-letter word by breaking it down into three parts, sorting these parts, and converting them to their respective characters. Finally, it prints the three-letter word for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
