The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` as it already meets the condition for the loop to execute. However, for clarity, we can specify that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable (its initial value is not relevant)**
