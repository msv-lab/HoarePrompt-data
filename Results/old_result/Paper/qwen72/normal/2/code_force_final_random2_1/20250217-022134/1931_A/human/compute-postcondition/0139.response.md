Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96`, `info[0][1] + 96`, and `info[0][2] + 96`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs exactly 3 times because it is defined as `for j in range(3)`.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `temp` will contain the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[0][0] + 96`, `info[0][1] + 96`, and `info[0][2] + 96`.
- The variable `j` will be 2, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, and `lex`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
