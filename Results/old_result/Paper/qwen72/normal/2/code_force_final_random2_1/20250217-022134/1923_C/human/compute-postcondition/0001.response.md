The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0

After executing the code:
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which are both integers and greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0.**
