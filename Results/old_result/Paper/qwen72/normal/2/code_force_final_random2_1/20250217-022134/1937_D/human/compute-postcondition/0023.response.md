Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains two elements [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not '>'**.
