To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `b` and the expression `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` has at least one element.
   - The range `range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive).
   - For the loop to execute, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `min(n, m) + 1 > 2`.
   - This simplifies to `min(n, m) > 1`.

4. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers from the input.
   - `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `T` is 2.
   - `ans` is `n`.

5. **Adjusted State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1.
   - The initial value of `b` should be 2 (the start of the range).

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers from the input, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 1, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n`**
