Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains an integer provided by the user within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the last element in `min_indices` that was processed; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` contains the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`); `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` or the last value of `i` that caused `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to return `=`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set by the user. The variable `i` will be the last element from `min_indices` that was processed in the loop. The `max_index` will still represent the largest index for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returned `<`, or it will remain 0 if no such index exists. The `min_indices` list will contain the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution, or it will contain the last value of `i` if no such indices exist. Finally, `min_index` will be the first element of `min_indices` or the last value of `i` that caused `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to return `=`.
