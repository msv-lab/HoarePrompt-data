Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 3.
- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `m`, `val`, `t`, `n`, or any other variables.

Output: **yes**
