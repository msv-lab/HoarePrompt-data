The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This ensures that `t` is always at least 1, so no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0**
