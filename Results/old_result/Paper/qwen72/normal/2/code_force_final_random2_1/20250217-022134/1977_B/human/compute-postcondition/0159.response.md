Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1', and `length` remains 30. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', or if `flag` is 0, then `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been left unchanged. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is now '-1', and `s[2]` is '0'. If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[2]` is now '-1', and `s[3]` is '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
