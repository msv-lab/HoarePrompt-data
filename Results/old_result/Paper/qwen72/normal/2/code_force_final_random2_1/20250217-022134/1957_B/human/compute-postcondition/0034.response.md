To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1` (which is the same as `k`).
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). This means \(i\) is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

3. **Calculate the values in `ans`:**
   - \((1 << i) - 1\): This is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\).
   - \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\): This is the difference between `k` and \(2^i - 1\).
   - `n - 2` zeros: This is a list of `n - 2` zeros.

4. **Construct the `ans` list:**
   - The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are `n - 2` zeros.

5. **Print the `ans` list:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Let's summarize the output:

- The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).
- The second element of `ans` is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
- The remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(2^i - 1) (k - (2^i - 1)) 0 0 ... 0 (with n - 2 zeros)**

This output is the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the construction of the `ans` list.
