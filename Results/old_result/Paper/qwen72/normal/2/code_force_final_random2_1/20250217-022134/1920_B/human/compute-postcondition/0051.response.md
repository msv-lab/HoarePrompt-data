Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
- `a[:x]` is a slice of the first `x` elements of the reversed list `a`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of these first `x` elements.
- `sums` is then calculated by subtracting twice this sum from `sum1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
