To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `w` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `pl` contains all unique integers from `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary that maps each integer in `palka` to its frequency.
   - `shapes` is the count of unique integers in `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 in `palka`.

3. **Calculating `shapes`:**
   - Iterate through the dictionary `d` and count how many keys have a value (frequency) of at least 3.
   - This count is stored in `shapes`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear at least 3 times)**
