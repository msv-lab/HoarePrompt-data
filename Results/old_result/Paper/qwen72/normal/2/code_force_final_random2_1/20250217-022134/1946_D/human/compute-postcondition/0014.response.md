The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. It shifts the value of `val` right by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the bit at position `i` of `val`. This bit is then XORed with `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element.
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is 0.
- `ai` is 0.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by 29 positions and then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the bit at position 29 of `val`.
2. `op ^= (val >> i & 1)` XORs the current value of `op` with the bit obtained from the previous step.

Since `op` is initially 0, the result of the XOR operation will be the bit at position 29 of `val`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will be the bit at position 29 of `val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is the bit at position 29 of `val`, `ai` is 0.**
