Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1.** 

The variable `L` is initialized to 1, while all other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
