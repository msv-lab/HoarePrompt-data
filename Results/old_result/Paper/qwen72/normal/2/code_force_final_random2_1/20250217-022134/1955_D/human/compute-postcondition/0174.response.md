Postcondition: ***The state of `aa`, `m`, and `n` remains such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` both have at least one more element. The variables `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in their respective slices. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.***
