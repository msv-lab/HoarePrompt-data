To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, where \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the computation).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, with `k` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `t` is calculated as \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{(the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in } a) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD}\), where `MOD` is a constant (typically \(10^9 + 7\)).
- `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative.
- `ans` is calculated as \(((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + (t \times (k-1)) \% \text{MOD}\).
- `i` is `k-1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Sum of Elements (`s`)**:
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum of Non-Negative Contiguous Subarrays**:
   - This is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` that contains only non-negative numbers. If no such subarray exists, the maximum subarray sum is 0.

3. **Calculation of `t`**:
   - `t` is computed as \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{max\_subarray\_sum}) \% \text{MOD}\).

4. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is computed as \(((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + (t \times (k-1)) \% \text{MOD}\).

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above. Since the exact values of `a`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables and the given formulas.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as \(((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + (t \times (k-1)) \% \text{MOD}\), with s being the sum of elements in list a, t being \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{max\_subarray\_sum}) \% \text{MOD}\), and max\_subarray\_sum being the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in list a)**.
