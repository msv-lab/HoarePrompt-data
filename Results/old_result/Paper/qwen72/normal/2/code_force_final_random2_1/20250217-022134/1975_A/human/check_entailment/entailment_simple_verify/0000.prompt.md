You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration, if `a` is non-decreasing (`check_all` is `True`), 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not non-decreasing (`check_all` is `False`), the loop checks if the sub-list `new` (starting from the first decrease) is non-decreasing and all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If both conditions are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of these checks for each input list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the splitting and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks one possible split point (the first place where the array is not in non-decreasing order) and does not consider all possible split points. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1 3 2 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]` is not initially sorted.
- The program will find the first out-of-order element at index 2 (`a[1] = 3` and `a[2] = 2`).
- It will then split the array into `x = [1, 3]` and `y = [2, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After swapping, the array becomes `y + x = [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]`, which is still not sorted.
- The program will incorrectly output "NO".

However, if we consider another split point, such as `x = [1, 3, 2]` and `y = [4, 5, 6]`, and swap them, the array becomes `y + x = [4, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2]`. Further splits can eventually lead to a sorted array. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not handle all possible split points and can produce incorrect results. Hence, the program is incorrect.
