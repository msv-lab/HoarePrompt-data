### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. The logic used is:
     ```python
     t = b
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
     This is equivalent to `t = (b + 1) // 2`, which correctly handles both even and odd values of `b`. This ensures that the number of screens is correctly calculated to fit all 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
     This calculation is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the program does not change the number of screens (`t`).
   - If the remaining cells are insufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     ```python
     t2 = a - t1
     if t2 % 15 == 0:
         t = t + t2 // 15
     else:
         t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     This logic is correct because it ensures that the number of additional screens is correctly calculated to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and checking if they can fit the 1x1 icons is also correct.
- The logic for calculating additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem description. The initial screen calculation can be simplified for clarity, but the current implementation is functionally correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
