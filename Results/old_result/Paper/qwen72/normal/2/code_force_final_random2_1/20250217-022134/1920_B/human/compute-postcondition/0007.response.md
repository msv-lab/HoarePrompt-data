To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

- The variable `i` is the loop counter and starts at 0 by default when using `range()`.
- The variable `k` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this does not affect the loop).
- `_` is 0 (this does not affect the loop).
- `n` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop).
- `k` is an input integer (this affects the loop).
- `x` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input (this does not affect the loop).
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a` (this does not affect the loop).
- `ans` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop).

To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be at least -1 because the loop runs `k + 1` times. Therefore, `k` must be at least -1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
