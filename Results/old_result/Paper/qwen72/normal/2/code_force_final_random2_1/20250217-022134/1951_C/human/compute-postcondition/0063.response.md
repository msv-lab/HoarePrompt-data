The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets across the `n` days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of sale days `n`, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a`. It returns the minimum total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets across the `n` days, ensuring no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.**
