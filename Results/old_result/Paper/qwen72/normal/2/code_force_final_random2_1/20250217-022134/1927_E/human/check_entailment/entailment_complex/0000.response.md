Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation for given n and k. The solution involves constructing a permutation array where the sum of every k consecutive elements differs by at most 1. The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Initializes a permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
   - Fills the permutation list by distributing the numbers from 1 to `n` in a way that ensures the k-level condition is met.
   - Prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
  - For each `i`, it fills the permutation list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with the current value of `curr_v`.
  - This ensures that the numbers are distributed in a way that the sum of every k consecutive elements will differ by at most 1.
  - The final permutation is constructed correctly based on the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Test Case Handling:**
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - Ensures that `func_1` is called the correct number of times.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The permutation generated by `func_1` meets the k-level condition.
- The program processes multiple test cases as required.

Given the above analysis, the program meets all the requirements of the problem statement and functions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
