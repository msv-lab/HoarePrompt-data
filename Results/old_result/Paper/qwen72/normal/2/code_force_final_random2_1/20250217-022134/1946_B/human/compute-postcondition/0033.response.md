The code snippet `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to `ans`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `ans` was initially defined as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD`.
- `t` is defined as `(t * 2) % MOD`.

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` will be:

\[ \text{ans} = ((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + t \% \text{MOD} + t \]

Since `t` is already defined as `(t * 2) % MOD`, the new value of `ans` can be expressed as:

\[ \text{ans} = ((s + (t * 2) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + (t * 2) \% \text{MOD} + (t * 2) \% \text{MOD} \]

Simplifying this:

\[ \text{ans} = ((s + (t * 2) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + 2 \times (t * 2) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, the expression simplifies further to:

\[ \text{ans} = ((s + t) \% \text{MOD} + \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} + 3 \times t \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t`, `i` is 1.**
