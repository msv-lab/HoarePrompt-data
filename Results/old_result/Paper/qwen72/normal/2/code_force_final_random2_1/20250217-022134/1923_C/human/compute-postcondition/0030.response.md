The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the value at index `a - 2` from the list `p` from the current value of `s`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input
- `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
