Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than 0. `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. Additionally, `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `a` is at least 2.**
