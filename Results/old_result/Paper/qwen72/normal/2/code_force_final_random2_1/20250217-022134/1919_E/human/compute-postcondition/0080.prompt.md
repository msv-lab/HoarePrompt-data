Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, `dp` is a list of 2 * n + 1 elements where `dp[n]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `offset` is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    for j in range(2 * n + 1):
        if dp[j] > 0:
            if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
            if j - 1 >= 0:
                new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
    dp = new_dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, and the loop will have executed exactly `2 * n + 1` times. The variable `j` will have taken on all values from 0 to `2 * n` inclusive. For each index `j` in the range [0, 2 * n], if `dp[j]` was greater than 0, then `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) will now be updated to `(dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` respectively. If `dp[j]` was not greater than 0, no changes were made to `dp` at those indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules defined in the loop, and `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is `2 * n`, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element has been updated based on the rules of the loop. Specifically, for each index `k` in the range `[0, 2 * n]`, if there was a non-zero value in `dp[k]` during any iteration, the adjacent elements `dp[k-1]` and `dp[k+1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by the value of `dp[k]` modulo `MOD`. `new_dp` is now equal to `dp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
