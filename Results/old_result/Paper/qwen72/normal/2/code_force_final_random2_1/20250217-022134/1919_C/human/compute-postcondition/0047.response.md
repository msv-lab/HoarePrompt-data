Postcondition: **`a` is either the first element of `l` or `l[x]` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` or `l[x-1]` is greater than both `a` (previously) and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` is `x + 1`, and `n` is unchanged.**
