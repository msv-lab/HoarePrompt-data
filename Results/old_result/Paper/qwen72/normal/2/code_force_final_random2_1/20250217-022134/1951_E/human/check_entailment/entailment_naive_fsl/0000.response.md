Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically, they do not handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings as required. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. However, it only checks the first half of the string against the reversed second half, which is not a complete check for palindromes. For example, it will incorrectly identify "abcba" as not a palindrome.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It also has logic that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. For example, it returns a fixed number of parts without ensuring that each part is non-palindromic.

3. **Missing Partition Logic**: The program does not include any logic to actually partition the string into non-palindromic substrings and print the results as specified in the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
