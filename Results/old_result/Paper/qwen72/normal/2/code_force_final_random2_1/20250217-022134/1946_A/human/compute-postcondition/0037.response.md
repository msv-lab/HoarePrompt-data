To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for i in range(0, num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop head, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`, as it is the loop counter. The variable `num` is the upper limit for the loop and cannot be adjusted within the loop itself.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `num` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is 1 (since it was 0 and is incremented by 1)
- `num` must be greater than 1 (to allow the loop to continue)

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0**
