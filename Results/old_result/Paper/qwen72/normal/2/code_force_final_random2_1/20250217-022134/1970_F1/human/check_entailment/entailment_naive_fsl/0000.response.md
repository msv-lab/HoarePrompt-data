Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it handles the scoring mechanism. Specifically, the conditions for checking if a goal is scored are not correctly implemented. Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
    pointsb += 1
    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
    pointsr += 1
    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
```

This code checks if the player's position is in the list of goals for the red team or the blue team. However, it does not account for the fact that a player can score in the wrong goal, which would result in the opposing team getting the point. For example, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should get the point, but the current code would incorrectly award the point to the red team.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:

```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

In this case, the blue player (B2) scores in the red goal (RG) at step 6, and the red player (R0) scores in the blue goal (BG) at step 12. According to the problem description, the blue team should get a point when B2 scores in the red goal, and the red team should get a point when R0 scores in the blue goal. However, the current program will incorrectly print:

```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

Instead of the correct output:

```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

The program fails to handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, leading to incorrect scoring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
