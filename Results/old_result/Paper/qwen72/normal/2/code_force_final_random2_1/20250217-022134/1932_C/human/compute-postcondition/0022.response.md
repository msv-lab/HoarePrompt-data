Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first two elements of `a` and now includes `a[2]`, `l` is 3, and `r` is `n - 1` if the second character of `s` is 'L' or `n - 2` if the second character of `s` is 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last two elements of `a` and now includes `a[r]`, `l` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'R' or 2 if the first character of `s` is 'L', and `r` is `n - 3` if the second character of `s` is 'R' or `n - 2` if the second character of `s` is 'L'.***
