Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
