The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the elements of the list `l1` into integers and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since `l1` is a list of strings obtained from user input, each element of `l1` is expected to be convertible to an integer.

- `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` is assigned the integer value of the second element in `l1`.

The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**
