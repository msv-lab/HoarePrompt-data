Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the new input integers. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`.
- The values of `c` and `r` are now updated to the new input integers.
- The condition for `num` remains the same: if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.
- All other variables (`k`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
