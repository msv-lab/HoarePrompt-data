To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `num` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is the number of times the loop executed.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
   - `new_median` is equal to `median + op`.
   - `b[ma]` is `median + op`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `op` is the number of times a loop executed. This value is not explicitly given but is derived from the execution of the loop.
   - The loop's execution count (`op`) is a crucial piece of information that needs to be determined from the context.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the number of times the loop executed.

Since the exact number of times the loop executed is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop executed)**
