You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and the `letters` list contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order and must have at least `len(digits)` elements, `i` is `len(digits) - 1`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`, the program returns False. If neither of these conditions is met, the program completes the loop without returning False.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `password`, which is a string of length 1 to 20 characters, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters from the `password` into two lists, sorts both lists in ascending order, and then concatenates them back into a single string. The function returns `True` if the concatenated string matches the original `password` and all digits in the `password` are in non-decreasing order, and no digit is greater than any letter in the `password`. In all other cases, the function returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
1
5
a1b2c
```

Expected output:
```
NO
```

Actual output:
```
YES
```

The issue arises because the program does not correctly check if there is a digit that comes after a letter. In the `func_1` function, the logic to ensure that no digit comes after a letter is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is not sufficient to enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter. This condition only checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not the correct way to enforce the rule.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that once a digit appears, no letter follows it. This can be achieved by maintaining a flag to track whether a digit has been encountered and ensuring no letters appear after the first digit.
