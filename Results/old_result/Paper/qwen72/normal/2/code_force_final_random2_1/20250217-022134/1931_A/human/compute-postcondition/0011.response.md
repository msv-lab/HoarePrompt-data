Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `arr` is now `[26]`.
