Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive), `j` is 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, so if the initial value of `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the new value of `lex` will be between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
