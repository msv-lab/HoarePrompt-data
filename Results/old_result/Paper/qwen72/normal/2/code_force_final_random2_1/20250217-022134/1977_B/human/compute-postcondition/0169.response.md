Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list containing '1', `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, and the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 1) is non-zero.**

Explanation: The code appends the string '1' to the list `s`. Initially, `s` was an empty list, so after the execution, `s` contains a single element, which is the string '1'. All other variables (`i`, `length`, `x`, `t`, `nalla`) and conditions (bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` being non-zero) remain unchanged.
