Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `numbers`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
