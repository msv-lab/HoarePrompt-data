Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `p` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\).
- `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\).
   - This formula is used to find the index of the middle element in a list of length `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then \(p = (5 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 3 // 2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\).

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.
   - Since `a` is sorted, the element at index `p` is the middle element of the list.
   - The count of this element is the number of times it appears in the list `a`.

3. **What is printed**:
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the count of the element at index p in the sorted list a, and p is calculated as (n + 1) // 2 - 1)**
