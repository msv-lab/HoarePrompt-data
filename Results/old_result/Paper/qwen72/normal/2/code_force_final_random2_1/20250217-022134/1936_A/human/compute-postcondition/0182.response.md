Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, the standard output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer.
- This operation does not affect the values of any variables.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
