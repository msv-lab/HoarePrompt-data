The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of these variables are updated based on the new input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`) remain unchanged unless they depend on the new values of `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `n` is now the first integer from the input.
- `m` is now the second integer from the input.
- `k` is now the third integer from the input.

The initial state specifies that:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` was an input integer.
- `m` was an input integer.
- `k` was an input integer.
- `sum_f` is `m * f`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `m * f`, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
