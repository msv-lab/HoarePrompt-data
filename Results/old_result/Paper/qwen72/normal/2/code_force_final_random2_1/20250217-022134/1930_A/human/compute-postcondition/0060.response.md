Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is equal to the initial value of `numCases`, `i` is equal to `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until the list is empty for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- The variable `numCases` retains its initial value, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The loop index `i` is equal to `numCases`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `numInteger` holds the last input integer for the final test case.
- The list `numbers` is empty, as all elements have been processed.
- The variable `suma` contains the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list for each test case, and this sum has been printed for each test case.
