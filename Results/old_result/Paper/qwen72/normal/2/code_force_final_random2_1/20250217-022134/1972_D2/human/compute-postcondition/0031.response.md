The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` was 2, so now `y` is 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`. `n` must be at least 15, and `m` must be at least 10.**
