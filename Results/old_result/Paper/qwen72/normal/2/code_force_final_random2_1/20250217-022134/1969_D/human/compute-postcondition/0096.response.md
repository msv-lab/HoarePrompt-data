Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+1` elements shorter and must contain at least one element. `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, and the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. In all cases, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`**.
