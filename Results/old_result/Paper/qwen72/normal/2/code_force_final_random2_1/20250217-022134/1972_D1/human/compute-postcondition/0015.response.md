To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `t` is 0.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `suma` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive.
- The loop condition is `i < b + 1`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is at least 1.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < b + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
- The condition `i < b + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, and `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is updated to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**
