The variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` contains the substring 'pie', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` no longer contains the substring 'map' but now contains at least one occurrence of the substring 'e'. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, no longer contains the substring 'map', and now contains at least one occurrence of the substring 'e'; `s` must contain the substring 'pie' for the loop to execute one more time; `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1**
