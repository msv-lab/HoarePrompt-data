You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration, if `a` is non-decreasing (`check_all` is `True`), 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not non-decreasing (`check_all` is `False`), the loop checks if the sub-list `new` (starting from the first decrease) is non-decreasing and all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If both conditions are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of these checks for each input list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
