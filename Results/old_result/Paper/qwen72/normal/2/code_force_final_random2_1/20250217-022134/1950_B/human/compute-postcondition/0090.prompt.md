Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(0, casos):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('##')
        print('##')
    elif n == 2:
        print('##..')
        print('##..')
        print('..##')
        print('..##')
    elif n == 3:
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
        print('..##..')
        print('..##..')
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
    elif n == 4:
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
    else:
        print('No esta en el rango')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` must be greater than 0, and `c` is 0. If `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. For any other value of `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, including 2, the state also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. If `n` == 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` == 2, 3, or 4, the state remains unchanged. For all other values of `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
