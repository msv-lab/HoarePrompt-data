Postcondition: ***`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'B', and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user. If 'B' is not present in the Counter object `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
