Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the number of unique elements in the list that appear at least three times, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally. The program should simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players, but the current implementation does not do this. Instead, it simply counts how many times each element appears in the list and divides by 3, which is not related to the game's scoring rules.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The correct output should be `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the provided program will output `0` because it incorrectly counts the occurrences of each element and divides by 3, which does not reflect the game's rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
