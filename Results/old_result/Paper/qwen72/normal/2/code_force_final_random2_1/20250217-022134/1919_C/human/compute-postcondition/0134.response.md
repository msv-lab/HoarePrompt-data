Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 3`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[y + 3]` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `c` is incremented by 1.**
