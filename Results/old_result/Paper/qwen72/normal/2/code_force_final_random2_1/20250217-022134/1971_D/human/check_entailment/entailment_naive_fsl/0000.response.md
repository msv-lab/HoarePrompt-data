Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string has multiple consecutive '1's followed by '0's correctly. For example, consider the input "1100". According to the problem description, the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange this string into a sorted binary string is 2 (cutting after the first '1' and rearranging the pieces "1" and "100"). However, the given program will output 3, which is incorrect. This is because the program increments the count every time it encounters a change in character, without considering whether the change is from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
