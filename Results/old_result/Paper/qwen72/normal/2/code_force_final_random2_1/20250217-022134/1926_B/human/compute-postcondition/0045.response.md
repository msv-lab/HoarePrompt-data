The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 (since it is initialized by the loop), `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, otherwise `a` remains 0; `b` remains an empty string if the count of '1' in `s` is not greater than 1, otherwise `b` is set to 'SQUARE'; `s` is a string input by the user.**
