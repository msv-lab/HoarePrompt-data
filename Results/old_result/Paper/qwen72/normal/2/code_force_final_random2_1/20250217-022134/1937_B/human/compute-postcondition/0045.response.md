The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but is designed to process a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and two binary strings `a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n}` and `a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n}`, each of length `n`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will return some form of result based on the processing of the binary strings.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of the binary strings.**
