You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of up to 1000 test cases, where each test case involves a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order (if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order). After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always generate a valid rearranged string `r` that is different from the original string `s`. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
8
codeforces
aaaaa
xxxxy
co
d
nutdealer
mwistht
hhhhhhhhhh
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
forcodesec
NO
YES
xxyxx
YES
oc
NO
YES
undertale
YES
thtsiwm
NO
```

### Actual Output:
```
YES
ceefoorsscd
NO
YES
co
NO
YES
cdeoelnrtu
YES
hiimsttw
NO
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
1. **Case: "co"**
   - The program outputs `co`, which is the same as the input string. According to the problem description, the rearranged string `r` should be different from `s`. Therefore, this is incorrect.

2. **Case: "nutdealer"**
   - The program outputs `cdeoelnrtu`, which is a valid rearrangement but not necessarily the best one. However, the main issue is that the program does not guarantee that the output string will be different from the input string in all cases.

3. **Case: "mwistht"**
   - The program outputs `hiimsttw`, which is a valid rearrangement but again, it does not guarantee that the output string will be different from the input string in all cases.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the generated string `r` is different from `s` in all cases where it is possible to do so. One way to achieve this is to swap two adjacent characters if the sorted string is the same as the input string. This ensures that the output string is different from the input string.
