The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since `math.gcd(x, y)` (which is `math.gcd(4, 4)`) equals 4, which is not 1, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 28, `m` is greater than or equal to 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**
