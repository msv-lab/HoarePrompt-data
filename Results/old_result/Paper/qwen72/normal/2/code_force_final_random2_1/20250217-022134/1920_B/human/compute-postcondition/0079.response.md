Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` is updated to contain the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to contain the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]]`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.**
