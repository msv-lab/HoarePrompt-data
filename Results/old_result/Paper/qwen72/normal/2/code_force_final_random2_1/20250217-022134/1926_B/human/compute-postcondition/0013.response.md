Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE' and `a` remains 0. If `s` contains no '1', `b` remains an empty string and `a` remains 0.***
