### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - Each excursion involves choosing a pair of children, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Over `k` excursions, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \(k \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the sum of initial friendship values `sum_f`.
   - It computes the total number of pairs \(\binom{n}{2}\) as `cn2`.
   - It calculates the numerator `p` and denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - It simplifies the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p` and `q`.
   - It computes the modular inverse of `q` and prints the result.

5. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - This formula correctly captures the expected value calculation, considering the initial friendship values and the increase over `k` excursions.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly by outputting 0.
   - It also handles large values of `n`, `m`, and `k` within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. The mathematical formulas and the handling of edge cases are appropriate.
