The code snippet `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `list0`. This operation updates the value of `list0` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`
- `i` is `x - 2`
- `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1
- If `num` is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `list0` is now a list of integers read from the input
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1.**
