#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The loop variable `_` has completed its range from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `s` were updated with new user inputs, `p` remains 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` for the current iteration, `i` has iterated through all keys in `hmp` for the current iteration, and `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. The final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from user input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the characters 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`. This count is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
