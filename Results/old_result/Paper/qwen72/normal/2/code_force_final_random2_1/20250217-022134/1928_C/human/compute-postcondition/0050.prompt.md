Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of the initial `nn` such that `nn % i != 0` plus 1. The dictionary `factors` will contain the prime factorization of the initial `n`, with each key being a prime factor and its value being the exponent in the factorization. The variable `nn` will be reduced to 1 if it was completely divisible by the prime factors found during the loop, or it will be the remaining part of the initial `n` that is not divisible by any smaller integers. If `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is incremented by 1. `primes` is a list containing all the keys (prime factors) from the `factors` dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for factor in generate(0):
    yield factor


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `generate(0)` has yielded `factor` and is now terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `generate(0)` has yielded `factor` and is now terminated, `factor` is the last yielded value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `generate(0)` has yielded all its values and is now terminated, `factor` is the last yielded value, and `factor` has been yielded again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
