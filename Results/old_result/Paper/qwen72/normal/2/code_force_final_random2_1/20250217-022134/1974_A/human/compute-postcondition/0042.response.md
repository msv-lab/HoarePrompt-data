Output State: **`a` is an integer (specifically, `a` is now the integer value of the first part of the input), `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts `b` to an integer, but since `b` was already specified as an integer in the initial state, the value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
