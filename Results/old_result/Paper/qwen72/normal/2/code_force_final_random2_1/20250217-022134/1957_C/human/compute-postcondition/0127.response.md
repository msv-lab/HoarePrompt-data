Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` retain their initial values, but the internal variables such as `num`, `m`, and `dp` are updated according to the logic within the loop. Specifically, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent elements calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The final value of `dp[m]` is printed for each test case.**
