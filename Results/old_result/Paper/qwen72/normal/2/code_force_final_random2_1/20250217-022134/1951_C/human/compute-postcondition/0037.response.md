Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, k)`, `s` is `min(b, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` from its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, k)`.
