Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, `flag` is 0. `flag` is not equal to 1.**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
