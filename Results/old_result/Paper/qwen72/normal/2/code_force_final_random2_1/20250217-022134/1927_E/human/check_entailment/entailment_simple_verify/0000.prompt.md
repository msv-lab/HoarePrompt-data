You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state is as follows: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is set to the value `j // k + 1` if `j % k == 0`, otherwise it is set to the value `(j // k) * k + (j % k) + 1`. The variable `curr_v` is `n + 1`, `i` is `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k * (n // k) + k - 1`. The variables `idx` and `idx_v` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: [elements of permutation separated by spaces]

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:

    #State: `t` is 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times where `t` is the initial value of `t`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program constructs a k-level permutation of length n as required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases using `func_2()`, which calls `func_1()` for each test case. This matches the problem description's requirement for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then fills the permutation array by placing values in positions that ensure the k-level condition is met. Specifically, it places values in positions that are multiples of `k` plus an offset `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`).
   - This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, as required by the problem description.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed in the required format for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible values for `n` and `k` (e.g., `n=2`, `k=2`) correctly.
   - It also handles larger values within the constraints (e.g., `n=200000`, `k=200000`).

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
