Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is now 1. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1. `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0. `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
