The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array, where the length of `a` is between 3 and 1000 inclusive. The function returns a sorted list `cts`, where each element in `cts` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` starting from each index `i` (from 0 to `len(a)-1`) up to the end of the list. Each element in `cts` is the sum of the elements in `a` from that index to the end of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array and returns a sorted list `cts` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` starting from each index to the end of the list.**
