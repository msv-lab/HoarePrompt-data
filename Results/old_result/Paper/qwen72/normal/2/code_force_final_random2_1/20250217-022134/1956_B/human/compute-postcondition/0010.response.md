The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of card numbers. For each test case, the function considers the number of cards `n` and the sequence of card numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

The function returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the problem statement, but it is inferred that the function evaluates some property or condition related to the distribution of card numbers.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cards `n` and a sequence of card numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It returns a result for each test case, likely evaluating some property or condition related to the distribution of card numbers.**
