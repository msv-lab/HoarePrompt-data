Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `arr` list as a key, and the corresponding value will be the number of times that integer appears in the `arr` list. The `arr` list itself remains unchanged.
