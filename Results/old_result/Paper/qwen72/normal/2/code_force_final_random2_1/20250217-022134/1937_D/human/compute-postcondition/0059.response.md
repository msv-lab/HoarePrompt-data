Postcondition: ***Given `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`. If `el` is '>', `preOne` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre` up to each index, starting with an initial value of 0, but missing its last element, and `totalOne` is decreased by 1. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated to include a new element `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is set to `totalOne`, `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` is set to `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is set to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
