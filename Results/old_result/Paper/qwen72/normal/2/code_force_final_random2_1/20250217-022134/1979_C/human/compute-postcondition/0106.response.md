Postcondition: ***`t` remains at least 1, `T` is 2, `bets` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[i]`. Otherwise, the elements in `a` remain unchanged.***
