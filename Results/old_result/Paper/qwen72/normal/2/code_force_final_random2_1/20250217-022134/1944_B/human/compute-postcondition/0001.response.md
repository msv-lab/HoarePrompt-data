The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, which already ensures that the loop can execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `q` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0**
