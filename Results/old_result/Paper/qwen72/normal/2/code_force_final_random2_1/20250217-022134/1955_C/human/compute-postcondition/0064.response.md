Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state continue to hold true.
