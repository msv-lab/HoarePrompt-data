The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `b` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `b` must still be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is set to `a + (a - 2) // 2` and `x` is set to \((a - 2) // 2\). Otherwise, `suma` and `x` remain unchanged.**
