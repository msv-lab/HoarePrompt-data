The code assigns new values to `n` and `k` using the function `func_3()`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after the assignment. However, we know that `n` and `k` must remain positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and their values are updated to those returned by `func_3()`.**
