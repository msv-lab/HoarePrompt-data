Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is set to `a`, `x` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `suma` remains 0 and `x` remains \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1\).***
