To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks the value of `mexsize % 2`.
   - If `mexsize % 2` equals 1 (i.e., `mexsize` is odd), it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize % 2` equals 0 (i.e., `mexsize` is even), it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` can be determined by finding the first missing positive integer in the sequence starting from 1.

5. **Possible Values of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` can be any positive integer from 1 up to `maxsize` (inclusive).
   - The parity (odd or even) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mexsize`.
   - However, we know that `mexsize` is either odd or even, and the `print` statement will output 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is even.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
