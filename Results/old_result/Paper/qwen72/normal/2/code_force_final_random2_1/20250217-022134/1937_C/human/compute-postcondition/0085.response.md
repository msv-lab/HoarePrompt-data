Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is `i`, and the current value of `r` is '>'**.

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`.
- All other variables (`n`, `I`, `R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 and the current value of `r` being '>' are still valid.
- The output buffer has been flushed, which remains unchanged.
