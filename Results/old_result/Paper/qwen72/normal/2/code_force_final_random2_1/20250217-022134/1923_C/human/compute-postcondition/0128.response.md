To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from user input.
   - `l`: A list of integers derived from user input that has been fully iterated over.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all integers in the list `l`.
   - `x`: The last integer in the list `l`.
   - `_`: The length of the list `l` + 1.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from user input.
   - `m`: Must be greater than the length of the list `l` + 1 and greater than 0.
   - `s`: 
     - If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is now equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
     - If `a - 2` is less than 0, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the line `print('NO')`.

Given the conditions and the print statement, the output will always be 'NO' because the print statement is hardcoded to print 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
