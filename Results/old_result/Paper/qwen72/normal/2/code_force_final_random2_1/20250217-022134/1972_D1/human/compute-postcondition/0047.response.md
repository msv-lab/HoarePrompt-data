Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1\) which simplifies to \(a + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- Given `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to \((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1\).
- This further simplifies to \((a - 0) // 1 + 1\), which is \(a + 1\).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
