### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. It also correctly reads the length of the password and the password itself for each test case.

2. **Character Classification**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done using a loop that checks if each character is a digit or a letter. This part is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - The program sorts both the `digits` and `letters` lists. This is necessary to ensure that the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It then checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order. If any digit is greater than the next digit, it returns `False`. This is correct.
   - However, the check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. This check is intended to ensure that no digit comes after a letter, but it incorrectly compares the last digit with each letter. Instead, it should check if any digit is followed by a letter in the original password.

4. **Final Password Check**:
   - The program combines the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and joins them into a single string.
   - It then compares this sorted string with the original password. If they are equal, the password is considered strong, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach is correct because it ensures that the password meets all the conditions: digits and letters are in non-decreasing order, and no digit comes after a letter.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees at least one character).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Comparison**: The comparison `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It should check if any digit is followed by a letter, which is not the same as comparing the last digit with each letter.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if any digit is followed by a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the incorrect comparison. The original program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
