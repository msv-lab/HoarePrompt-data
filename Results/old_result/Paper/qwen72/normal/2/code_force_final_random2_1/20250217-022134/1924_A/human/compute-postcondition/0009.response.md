Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty, `i` is the first character of `s`, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the first character of `s` (`i`) is in the set `alphabet`. The size of the set `alphabet` is exactly k.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the set `alphabet` to contain the first k lowercase English alphabets, which are generated using the range from 97 to 97 + k.
- The initial state specified that `alphabet` was a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the first character of `s` (`i`) was in the set `alphabet`.
- After executing the code, the set `alphabet` now contains exactly k elements, which are the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- All other variables (`s`, `i`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
