The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` to the variable `new_median`. Given that `b[ma]` is `median + 2`, the value of `new_median` will be `median + 2`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is `median + 2`, `b[ma]` is `median + 2`.**
