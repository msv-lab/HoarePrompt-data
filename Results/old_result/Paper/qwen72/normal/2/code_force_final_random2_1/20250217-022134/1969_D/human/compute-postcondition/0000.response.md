Output State: **`test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet calls `func_1()` and assigns its return value to the variable `test_cases`. Since no specific values or types for the return value of `func_1()` are provided in the initial state, the output state reflects that `test_cases` now holds whatever `func_1()` returns. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
