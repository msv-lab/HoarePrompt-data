Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `s` from its current value.
- The new value of `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `c`, `l`) remain unchanged.
