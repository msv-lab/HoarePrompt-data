Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.
- For each iteration, the variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- After all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.
- All other variables (`zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final`, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
