Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a new input string with at least 1 character. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 1. If the number of 'A's in `a` is greater than the number of 'B's in `a`, then `l` > `h`; otherwise, the number of 'A's in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 'B's in `a`, so `l` â‰¤ `h`.***
