The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `sz` was the current element being processed, and `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `a` must be available. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order and has at least 1 element, the next element will be the next value in the sequence.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 1 element
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mexsize` is 2 if the first element of `a` (`sz`) is 1, otherwise `mexsize` remains 1

At the start of the next iteration:
- `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`
- The list `a` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2 if the first element of `a` (`sz`) is 1, otherwise `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**
