To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 1
  - `n` is greater than 1
  - If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`) twice.
  - If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0 and `ans2` is unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

2. **Adjust `n`:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- The values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and are not directly affected by the loop control.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged**
