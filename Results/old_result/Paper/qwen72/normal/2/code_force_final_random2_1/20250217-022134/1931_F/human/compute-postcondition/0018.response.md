The `input()` function consumes another input, which means an additional input has been consumed beyond the initial state. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 3, and an additional input has been consumed.**
