Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is more than 1, or `b` remains an empty string if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `s` is a new string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is 2; `s` is a new string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
