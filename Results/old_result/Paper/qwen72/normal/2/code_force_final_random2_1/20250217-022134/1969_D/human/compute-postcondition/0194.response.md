Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `test_cases` is 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices` for the last iteration, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `test_cases` has been decremented to 0.
- The `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` from the last iteration, sorted as per the logic in the loop.
- The `remaining_items` list remains empty.
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration.
- The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` contain the values returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration.
- The `combined` list is empty, as all elements have been processed.
- The `current_profit` holds the final profit value after processing all elements in `combined` during the last iteration.
- The `max_profit` holds the highest profit value observed across all iterations of the loop.
