Output State: **`t` is at least 1, the input file has at least seven lines, `line` is the fourth line of input data for the second test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.** 

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` by whitespace and assigns the resulting list to `elements`. The other variables (`t`, the input file, and `line`) remain unchanged.
