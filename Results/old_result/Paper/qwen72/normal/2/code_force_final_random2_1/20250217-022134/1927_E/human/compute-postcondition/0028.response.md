Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except `permutation[1]` which is now `m + 1` and `permutation[k + 1]` which is now `m + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m + 3`; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1, changing from `m + 2` to `m + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
