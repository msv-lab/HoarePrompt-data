The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `tc` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, if `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the program follows the logic for the else part.**
