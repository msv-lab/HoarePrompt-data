Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as the first integer from the input, `m` remains the same as the second integer from the input, `k` is the initial `k` minus the total sum of `s` over all iterations, `l` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user, `t` is the total sum of `s` over all iterations, `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, and `s` is the last computed value of `min(m, k)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: This remains unchanged as it is the number of sale days provided in the input.
- **`m`**: This also remains unchanged as it is the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day provided in the input.
- **`k`**: This is the initial `k` minus the total sum of `s` over all iterations. `s` is the number of tickets bought each day, which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining `k`.
- **`l`**: This remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the user, representing the prices per ticket for each day.
- **`t`**: This is the total sum of `s` over all iterations, representing the total number of tickets bought.
- **`c`**: This is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, representing the total cost of buying the tickets.
- **`s`**: This is the last computed value of `min(m, k)`, which is the number of tickets bought in the last iteration.
