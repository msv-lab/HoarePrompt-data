Output State: **`t` is 0, `func_1()` has been called `t` times where `t` is the initial value of `t`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `t` becomes 0. The function `func_1()` will have been called exactly as many times as the initial value of `t`, since the loop runs once for each decrement from the initial value down to 0.
