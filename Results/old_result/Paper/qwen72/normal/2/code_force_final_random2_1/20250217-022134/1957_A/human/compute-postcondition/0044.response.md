The code snippet `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `palka`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `palka`. The new value of `palka` is a list of integers read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
