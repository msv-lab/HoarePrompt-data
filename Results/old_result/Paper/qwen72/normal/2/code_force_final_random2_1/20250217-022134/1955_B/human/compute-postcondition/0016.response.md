The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `h` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `h` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` has a new element `a + k * c + d` appended to it.**
