Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, and the program continues execution from the next line.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all variables retain their original values, and the program simply moves on to the next line of code.
