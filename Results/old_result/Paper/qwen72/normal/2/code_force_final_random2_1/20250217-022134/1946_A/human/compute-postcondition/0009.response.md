The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop is iterating a fixed number of times specified by `t`. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop is iterating over a range defined by `t`, the state of `t` does not change between iterations, but the loop counter (represented by `_`) increments by 1 each time the loop runs.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop has already run once, so the loop counter `_` has incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` will increment again, but since `_` is not explicitly tracked, we focus on the fact that `t` remains the same and the loop will continue to run until it has completed `t` iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`**. 

Note: The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` remains unchanged because they are not modified by the loop head. The loop counter `_` is incremented, but it is not explicitly part of the state description.
