Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]` (which is non-negative), and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is set to 1, and `sunks` is set to 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then `k` remains unchanged, and if `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is set to 1, 2, or 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
