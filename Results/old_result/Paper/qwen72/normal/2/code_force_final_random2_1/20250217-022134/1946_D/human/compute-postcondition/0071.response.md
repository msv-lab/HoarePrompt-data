Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the first element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` and is currently 0; `ai` is 0; `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element.
- `val` remains the first element of `a`.
- `op` is still updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and it is currently 0.
- `ai` is now set to 0.
- `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`, which is `0 ^ val` (since `ai` is now 0). Therefore, `t` contains the value `val`.
