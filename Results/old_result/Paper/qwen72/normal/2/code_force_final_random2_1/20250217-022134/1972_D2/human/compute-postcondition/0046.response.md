The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given the initial values, `x` is 4 and `y` is 2, so `(x + y) * x` equals 24 and `(x + y) * y` equals 12. Since `n` is at least 20 and `m` is at least 5, `n // 24` is at least 0 and `m // 12` is at least 0. However, since `m` is at least 5, `m // 12` will be 0 (as 5 divided by 12 is less than 1). Thus, the minimum value is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 20, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 2, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
