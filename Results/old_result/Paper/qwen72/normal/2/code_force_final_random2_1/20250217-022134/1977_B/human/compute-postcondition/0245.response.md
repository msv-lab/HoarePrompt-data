The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraint that `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, since no parameters are passed to the function, it likely uses a predefined value or generates a value internally based on the constraint for `x`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is expected to return a value based on an internal or predefined positive integer `x` where 1 ≤ x < 2^30. The specific return value is not defined in the given information.**
