Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `i_old + 1`, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, `idx2` is `i_old + 1`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The variable `idx2` is assigned the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is `i_old + 1`, `idx2` is also `i_old + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
