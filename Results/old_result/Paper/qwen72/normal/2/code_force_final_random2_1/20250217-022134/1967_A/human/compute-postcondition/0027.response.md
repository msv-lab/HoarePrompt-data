The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1**.
