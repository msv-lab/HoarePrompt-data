Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last element of `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `combined` is now one element shorter.**

Explanation:
- The `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` operation pushes the last element of the `combined` list onto the `heap`.
- The `heap` is now a list containing this last element.
- The `combined` list is now one element shorter, as the last element has been removed.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
