The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj[a]` by appending the integer `b` to it. The variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly modified by this code, but the structure of the list `adj` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements.**
