Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
   - However, it incorrectly handles the middle character for odd-length strings. It should compare `ch[:x]` with `ch[-x:][::-1]` to handle the middle character correctly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly determine the number of parts. It uses a fixed set of values (1, 2, 3, 4) without a clear explanation of how these values relate to the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If it is, then the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
- If it is not, then the string can be partitioned into one part (the entire string itself).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def solve(s):
    if is_palindrome(s):
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES", 1, [s]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    result = solve(s)
    if result == "NO":
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(result[1])
        print(" ".join(result[2]))
```

This solution correctly checks if the string is a palindrome and prints the appropriate output based on the problem requirements.
