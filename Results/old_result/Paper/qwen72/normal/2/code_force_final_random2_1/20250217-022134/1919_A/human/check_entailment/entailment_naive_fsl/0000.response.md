Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution incorrectly determines the winner based solely on whether the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This approach fails to account for the actual game mechanics, which involve players taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing the game.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

Consider the input:
```
1
2 1
```
According to the provided program, the output would be:
```
Bob
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
Alice
```
Here's why:
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After the swap, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
- Bob now has to remove a coin, leaving him with 1 coin.
- Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins.
- Bob cannot make a move because he cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet, so Alice wins.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible inputs and is therefore incorrect.
