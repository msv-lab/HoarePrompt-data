Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is the initial input integer, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is `cases - 1`, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `i` will have reached the value `cases - 1`, which is the last index of the `info` list. The variable `temp` will contain the string formed from the last sublist in `info`, converting each integer in the sublist to its corresponding character by adding 96 to it and then converting to a character using `chr`. The variable `j` will be 2, as it always reaches 2 at the end of each inner loop iteration. The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
