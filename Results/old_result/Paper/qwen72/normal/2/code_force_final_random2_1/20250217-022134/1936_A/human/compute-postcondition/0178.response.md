Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not `=`, otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, the standard output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string. Additionally, `s` is not `<`.***
