The function `solve` does not take any direct parameters but reads input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), where n is the length of the strings to be considered, and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use.
