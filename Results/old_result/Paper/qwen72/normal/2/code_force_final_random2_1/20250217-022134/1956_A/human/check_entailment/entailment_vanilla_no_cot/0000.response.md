Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` simply checks if `a` (the first element of the sequence `a`) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of players `n_i`). This is not sufficient to simulate the rounds of the game where players are removed according to the positions specified in the sequence `a`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the rounds of the game, removing players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed. The number of remaining players after this process will be the number of winners. The current implementation does not perform this simulation and thus cannot produce the correct results for the given problem.
