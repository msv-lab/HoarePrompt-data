Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` must be greater than 1.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers.
- `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration.
- `i` is 1.
- `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.
- `j` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(temp)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `info`**:
   - `info` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains three sorted integers.
   - Since `i` is 1, we are looking at the second sublist in `info` (indexing starts from 0).

2. **Calculating `temp`**:
   - `temp` is constructed by converting the integers in `info[1]` to their corresponding ASCII characters.
   - Specifically, `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96` are used to get the ASCII values.
   - Adding 96 to each integer in `info[1]` shifts the values to the range of lowercase letters in the ASCII table (97 corresponds to 'a').

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `info[1]` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - `info[1][0] + 96` = 1 + 96 = 97, which corresponds to 'a'.
   - `info[1][1] + 96` = 2 + 96 = 98, which corresponds to 'b'.
   - `info[1][2] + 96` = 3 + 96 = 99, which corresponds to 'c'.
   - Therefore, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

### Final Output:
The `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp`, which is constructed from the ASCII values of the integers in `info[1]` shifted by 96.

Output: **'abc' (where 'abc' is the string constructed from the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`)**
