Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify if it satisfies the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by creating a list `nums` containing the first 21 powers of 2. This ensures that the list has a wide range of values, which can be used to form various subsequences.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`**: The program iterates through the `nums` list to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by finding the index `idx` where `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying the List**:
   - The program removes the power of 2 at index `idx` from `nums`.
   - It then appends three new elements to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list.

### Verification of Conditions:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to exactly `k`. This is because the removed element was crucial for forming a sum of `k` using the remaining elements.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The initial list of powers of 2 can form any sum up to \(2^{20} - 1\) (which is much larger than `n` in the given constraints).
   - By removing one element and adding three new elements, the program still maintains the ability to form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Edge Cases:
- For small values of `k`, the program correctly handles the removal and addition of elements.
- For large values of `k`, the program ensures that the added elements do not interfere with the requirement of forming all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
