To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the function call `func_2(max_index, min_index)` on the program's state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
- `i` is the last element in `min_indices` that was processed.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` contains the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
- `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` or the last value of `i` that caused `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to return `=`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_2(max_index, min_index)
```

### Analysis:
- The function `func_2` is called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments.
- The specific behavior of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state. However, we can infer that `func_2` might modify `max_index` and `min_index` or other variables, but without more details, we assume it does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `min_indices`.

### Output State:
- `n` remains an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
- `i` remains the last element in `min_indices` that was processed.
- `max_index` remains the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` remains the list of indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` during the loop's execution. If no such indices exist, `min_indices` contains the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
- `min_index` remains the first element of `min_indices` or the last value of `i` that caused `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to return `=`.
- The function `func_2` is called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments, but the specific changes to the state are unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the last element in `min_indices` that was processed; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<` or remains 0 if no such `i` exists; `min_indices` contains the indices where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned `<` or the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`); `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` or the last value of `i` that caused `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to return `=`; `func_2(max_index, min_index)` is called.**
