Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `T` is an input integer. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the number of sides of the polygon; `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen; `y` is an integer equal to 0, representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = n - list0[-1]
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `x - 2`, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `num` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is the new input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is incremented by `x - 1`, ensuring `T` remains greater than the current value of `_`. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
