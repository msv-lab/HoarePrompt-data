Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. Additionally, either `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
