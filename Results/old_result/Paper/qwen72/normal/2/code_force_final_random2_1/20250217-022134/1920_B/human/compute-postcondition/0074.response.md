The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` already contains one element, which is `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`. After appending `sums`, which is also equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, the list `ans` will contain two elements, both being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
