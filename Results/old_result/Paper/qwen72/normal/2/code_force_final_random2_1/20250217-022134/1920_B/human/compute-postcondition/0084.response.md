Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated as `previous_sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated with the values provided by the user input.
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `_`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `ans`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are now specific integers provided by the user.
- The logic for updating `ans` based on the conditions remains the same.
