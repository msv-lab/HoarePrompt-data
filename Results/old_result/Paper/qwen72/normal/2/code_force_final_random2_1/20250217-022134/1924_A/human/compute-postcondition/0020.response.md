Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty. `i` is the second character of `s`. `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is updated to contain the first two characters of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is updated to exclude the first and second characters of `s`. If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is updated to contain the first and second characters of `s`, and `alphabet` is updated to exclude the first and second characters of `s`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the state remains unchanged.***
