Output State: **`n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is still greater than 0. The other variables (`a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
