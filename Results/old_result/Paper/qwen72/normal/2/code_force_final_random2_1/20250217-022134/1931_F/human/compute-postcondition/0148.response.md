Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, and the program has waited for user input for each iteration. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply ends the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, all the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
