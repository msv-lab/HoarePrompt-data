The code snippet `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `t` to it. Let's go through the impact of this code:

- `ans` was initially calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- `t` is the value of `t % MOD`.

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, `i` is 0.**
