Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 1, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, if `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, if `m` is equal to 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is now equal to `l1` and `a1` is placed at the position `idx2` in `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1` and `l` is now a reference to `l2`.**
