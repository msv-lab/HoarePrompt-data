To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `_` and the expression `m - 2`. For the loop to execute, the expression `m - 2` must be greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`

We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2**
