### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - Initializes `x` to 1 and iterates up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
     - For each `x`, initializes `y` to 1 and iterates while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) to ensure \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
     - If the gcd condition is met, increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).
     - Prints the count of valid pairs after the loops.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `x` starts at 1 and iterates up to \(\sqrt{n}\) to reduce the number of iterations.
     - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the valid pairs.
   - **Inner Loop**:
     - For each `x`, `y` starts at 1 and iterates while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
     - If the gcd condition is met, the number of valid pairs is incremented by the minimum of \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).
   - **Output**:
     - The count of valid pairs is printed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot x\) and \(b = k \cdot (x + y) \cdot y\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The gcd condition ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are in the simplest form.
   - The loop bounds ensure that \(a\) and \(b\) do not exceed \(n\) and \(m\) respectively.
   - The use of `min` ensures that the count does not exceed the limits of \(n\) and \(m\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where \(n\) or \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)).
   - The algorithm also handles large values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic and implementation are sound and handle the constraints effectively.

Final: **True**
