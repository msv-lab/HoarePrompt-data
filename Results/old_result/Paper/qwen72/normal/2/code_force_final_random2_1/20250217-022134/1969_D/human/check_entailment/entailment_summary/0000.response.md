### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads the space-separated integers for the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`, as well as the prices `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4` initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
   - It reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
   - It reads the prices `a_i` and converts them to negative values to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default).
   - It reads the bonuses `b_i`.
   - It combines the negative prices and bonuses into a list of tuples and sorts this list by the bonus values.

3. **Heap Management:**
   - The function pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
   - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3`, which sums the profits of the items in the heap and the remaining items.
   - It iterates through the remaining items, updating the heap and recalculating the profit to find the maximum possible profit.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing the profits of the items in the heap and the remaining items.
   - The function ensures that the profit is maximized by considering the optimal selection of items to be sold to Bob.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the data, and calculates the maximum profit for each test case. The use of a heap ensures that the selection of items is optimized, and the profit calculation is accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
