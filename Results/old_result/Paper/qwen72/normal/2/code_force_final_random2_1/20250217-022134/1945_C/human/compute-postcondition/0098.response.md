Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, and `one` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 1 otherwise. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1, and `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1, and `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. In both cases, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are recalculated based on the updated values of `zero` and `one`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `i` is incremented by 1, and `lst` contains the element 1. The conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain as described.***
