The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` modifies the list `a` by appending a new element to it. This new element is the result of subtracting the element at index `i - 1` of list `T` from the element at index `i - 1` of list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `i - 1` evaluates to `0`.
2. `a[i - 1]` is equivalent to `a[0]`.
3. `T[i - 1]` is equivalent to `T[0]`.
4. The new element appended to `a` is `a[0] - T[0]`.

Therefore, the list `a` now has one additional element, which is the result of `a[0] - T[0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` has one additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`.**
