Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m`, `a` is the last input integer from the loop, `b` is the last input integer from the loop, `f` is the last input integer from the loop, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * 0 + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` recalculates the value of `cn2` using the current value of `n`. Since `n` is the first input integer, `cn2` is now specifically `n * (n - 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
