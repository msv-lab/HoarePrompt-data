The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` as inputs. It calculates and returns the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element that is `times` positions back from the end of the list. If `times` exceeds the length of `arr`, the function considers the first element of the list. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
