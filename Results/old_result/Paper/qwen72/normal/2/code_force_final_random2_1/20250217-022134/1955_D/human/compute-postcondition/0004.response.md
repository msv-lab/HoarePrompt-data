The code `bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, and then converts each part into a string, storing these strings in the list `bb`.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the new input split by spaces.**
