### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
   - It then reads the prices `a_i` and `b_i` for Alice and Bob, respectively.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices `a_i` are negated to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` module only supports min-heaps).
   - The prices and bonuses are combined into a list of tuples and sorted by the bonus `b_i`.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program pushes the first `k` items into a min-heap, which simulates Bob taking the `k` items with the highest `b_i` values.
   - It calculates the initial profit by summing the profits of the items in the heap and the remaining items.

4. **Optimization Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit by considering the effect of adding each item to the heap and removing the least profitable item from the heap.
   - It updates the maximum profit observed during this process.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads the number of test cases.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list of integers.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Calculates the total profit for a given set of items and a heap of selected items.
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Processes each test case, reads the input, and calculates the maximum profit using the heap and sorting techniques.

### Potential Issues:

- **Negation of Prices**: The negation of `a_i` is used to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` (which is a min-heap). This is a correct approach.
- **Profit Calculation**: The profit calculation logic is correct, but it could be more clearly documented.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's maximum profit under the given constraints. The use of heaps and sorting ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the problem requirements correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
