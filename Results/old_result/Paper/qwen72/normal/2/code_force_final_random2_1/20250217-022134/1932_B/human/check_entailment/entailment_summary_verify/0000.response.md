Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed designed to solve a different problem, which involves path traversal and obstacle avoidance, rather than calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on periodic occurrences. The problem requires a different approach, such as calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities while considering the sequential nature of the signs. The current functions do not perform these calculations and are therefore not suitable for solving the given problem.

Final: **False**
