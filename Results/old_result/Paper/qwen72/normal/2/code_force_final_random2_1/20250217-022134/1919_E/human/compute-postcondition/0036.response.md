The function `func_2` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given context, it seems the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`.

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array `a`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided context, but typically, such a function would process the input parameters and return some result based on the hidden array `a` and its prefix sums.

Given the lack of explicit return information, I will assume the function processes the input and returns the hidden array `a` or some derived information about it.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (a positive integer indicating the number of test cases), `n` (a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array `a`), and `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`). The function processes these inputs and returns the hidden array `a` or some derived information about it.**
