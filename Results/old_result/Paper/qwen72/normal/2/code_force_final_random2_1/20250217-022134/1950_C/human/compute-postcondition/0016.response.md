Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, and `h` is not equal to 0. If `h` > 12, `day` is 'PM', `h` is now `h - 12`, and the current value of `h` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' unless `h` is 12, in which case `day` is 'PM', and `h` is less than or equal to 12.***
