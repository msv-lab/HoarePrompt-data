Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 0, except if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', in which case `s` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 1.***
