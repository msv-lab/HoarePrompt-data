To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `combined`.

According to the provided state:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order.
- The loop condition is `while combined:` This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `combined` is now `k+1` elements shorter, meaning some elements have been removed from `combined`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

Since the only requirement for the loop to continue is that `combined` is not empty, no adjustments are needed to the state of `combined` itself. The state provided already ensures that `combined` has elements remaining, as it is described as being `k+1` elements shorter but not necessarily empty.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. `combined` is now `k+1` elements shorter, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
