The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can be either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending 26, the new state of `arr` will be `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` depending on its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], and if `lex` < 28, `info` is [[1, 1, lex]], and `lex` is the input integer with the current value of `lex` being less than 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]]. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 51. If `lex` ≥ 52, `info` is updated to [[26, 26, lex - 78]], and `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 78.**
