Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop (either being the greatest or the smallest depending on the conditions), `b` will be the second-to-last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop, and `c` will be the count of how many times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution. The value of `x` will be `n`, and `y` will remain the index where the initial condition `l[y] > l[y-1]` was first met or `n-1` if never met. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, which is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking. `a` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, which could be the last element of `l` or another element based on the conditions met during the loop. `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, if such an element exists; otherwise, `b` remains 0. `c` is the count of how many times the condition `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` was true during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by the total number of iterations, `n` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` remains the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` or `n - 1` if no such index exists, `a` is the final value of `a` after all iterations, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, and `c` is the total count of updates to `a` or `b` where `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` or `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
