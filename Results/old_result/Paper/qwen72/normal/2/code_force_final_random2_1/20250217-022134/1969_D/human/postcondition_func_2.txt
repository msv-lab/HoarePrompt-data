The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers each. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap` and adds to this sum the values of the first and second elements of all tuples in `primary_items` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this total sum. The original lists `primary_items` and `secondary_heap` remain unchanged.
