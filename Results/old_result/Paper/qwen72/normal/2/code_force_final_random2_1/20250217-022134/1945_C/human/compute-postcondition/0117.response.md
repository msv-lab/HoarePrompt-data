The only objects in the loop head are the list `lst` and the variable `ele`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must contain at least two elements, and `ele` is the second element in `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least three elements, and `ele` will be the third element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`**
