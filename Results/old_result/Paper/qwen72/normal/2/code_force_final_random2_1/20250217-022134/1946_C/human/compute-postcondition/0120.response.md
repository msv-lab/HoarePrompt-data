Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 25001.**

Explanation: The code snippet `numCuts = 0` sets the variable `numCuts` to 0. Since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
