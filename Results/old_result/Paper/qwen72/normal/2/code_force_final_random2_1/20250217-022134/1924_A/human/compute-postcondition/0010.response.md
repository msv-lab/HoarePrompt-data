Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must be non-empty, `i` is the first character of `s`, `s1` is an empty string, and the first character of `s` (`i`) is in the set `alphabet`. If the size of `alphabet` is greater than 1, `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets except for the first character of `s` (`i`). If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.***
