To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `x`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `y + 1` to `n - 1`.
- `y`: This is the starting point for the range.
- `n`: This is the upper limit for the range.

For the loop to execute, the range `range(y + 1, n)` must contain at least one value. This means that `y + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an updated input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`).
- `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` or `n - 1` if no such index exists.
- `a` is the first element in `l`.
- `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0.
- `c` is 0.

We need to ensure that:
- `y + 1 < n` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `y` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0, and `c` is 0.**
