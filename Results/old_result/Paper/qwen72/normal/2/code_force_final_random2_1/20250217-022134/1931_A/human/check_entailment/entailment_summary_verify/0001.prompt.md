You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `cases` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) representing an encoded value of a three-letter word. It processes `lex` to determine the corresponding three-letter word by breaking it down into three parts, sorting these parts, and converting them to their respective characters. Finally, it prints the three-letter word for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates over a fixed range of 2 (since we need to determine the positions of the first two letters).
   - Inside the loop, it checks the value of `lex` (the encoded sum) and appends the appropriate values to `arr`:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
3. **Output Handling**: The program constructs the final word by converting the positions in `arr` to their corresponding characters and prints the result.

**Issues**:
- The logic for determining the positions of the letters is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending values to `arr` do not always ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- The program does not handle cases where the sum can be split into different combinations of letters that result in the same total but are not lexicographically smallest.

**Correct Approach**:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
- We need to ensure that the sum of the positions of the three letters equals the given encoded value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the positions of the letters
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        # Adjust the positions to match the encoded value
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            elif b < 26:
                b += 1
                c = 1
            else:
                a += 1
                b = 1
                c = 1
        # Convert positions to characters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)
```

**Explanation**:
- We initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1, representing the smallest possible values for the letters.
- We increment the positions starting from the last letter (`c`) and moving to the first letter (`a`) if necessary, ensuring the sum matches the encoded value.
- Finally, we convert the positions to their corresponding characters and print the result.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word.)
