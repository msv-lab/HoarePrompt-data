The only object in the loop head is the variable `res`, which is an element of the list `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to process. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, and `res` was the last element processed.

For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `res` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the second element in the list `results`**
