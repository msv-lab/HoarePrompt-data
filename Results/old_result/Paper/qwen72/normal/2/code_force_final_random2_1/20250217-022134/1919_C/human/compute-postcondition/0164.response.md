Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer that must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[3]`, `c` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
