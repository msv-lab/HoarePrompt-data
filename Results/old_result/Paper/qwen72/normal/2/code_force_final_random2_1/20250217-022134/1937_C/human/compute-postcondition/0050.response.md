Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is the next element in `min_indices`; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` must contain at least one element; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`. If `i` equals `max_index`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
