The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
