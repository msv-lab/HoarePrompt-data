Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` remains a list of `t` test cases, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count` (which is initially 0), `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now a list of integers from `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is now `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` to it.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are used to look up the value in the `freq` dictionary, which is then added to `beautiful_count`.
