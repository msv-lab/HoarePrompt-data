To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\).
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n)` contains at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(0, n)` function.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`max_index`, `min_indices`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop.
- The other variables (`max_index`, `min_indices`) remain as they are.

Given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(n \neq 2\), `n` is already greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 0; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`**.
