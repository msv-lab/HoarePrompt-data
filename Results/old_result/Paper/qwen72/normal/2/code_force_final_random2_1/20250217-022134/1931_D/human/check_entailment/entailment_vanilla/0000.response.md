### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for a pair to be beautiful.
   - If the required remainders are already in the frequency dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of those remainders.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
     - `freq` dictionary to store the frequency of remainder pairs.
     - `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - **Iterate through the array:**
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
     - Calculate `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.
     - Check if the required remainders are in the frequency dictionary and update `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.
   - **Output:**
     - Append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the required remainders and counts the pairs that meet the conditions.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the solution should work within the given limits.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
