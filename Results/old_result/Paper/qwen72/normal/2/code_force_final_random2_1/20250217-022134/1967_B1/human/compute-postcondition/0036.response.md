Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` remains the same, `t` is 2, `T` is 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`ans`**: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` is updated by summing up the values of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This means that for each value of `b` in this range, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is computed and added to `ans`.
- **`b`**: The loop variable `b` will have the value `min(n, m) + 1` after the loop completes, as it increments by 1 in each iteration and stops when `b` exceeds `min(n, m) + 1`.
- **`min(n, m)`**: This value remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is used to determine the upper limit of the loop but is not modified within the loop.
- **`t` and `T`**: These variables are not affected by the loop and remain at their initial values of 2.
