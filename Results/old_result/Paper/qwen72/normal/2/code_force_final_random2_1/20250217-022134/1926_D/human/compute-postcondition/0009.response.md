Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the list of integers `a_1, ..., a_n` consists of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `data` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `data`, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR `check` (i.e., `s = i ^ 2147483647`).**
