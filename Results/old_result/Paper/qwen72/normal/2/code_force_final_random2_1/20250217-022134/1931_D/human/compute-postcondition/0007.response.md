To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `a` in the loop head. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, so for the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases
- Each test case contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is the list of `n` integers from the current test case
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `a` must be a non-empty list of integers.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
