Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the Kraken attacks the first and last ships in alternating order correctly. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loop does not properly account for the alternating nature of the attacks. For instance, consider the following input:

```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

The expected output is `2`, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to the flawed logic in handling the alternating attacks. The program should decrement the durability of the first and last ships alternately until the Kraken's attacks are exhausted or all ships have sunk. The current implementation does not ensure this alternating behavior correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.
