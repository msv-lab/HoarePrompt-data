Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and caused `ans` to be set to False. If `ans` is False, it means there was at least one instance where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted. If `ans` is True, it means the loop completed without finding any such instances.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration. If `ans` is False, the loop broke early due to the unsorted `nums` condition; otherwise, the loop completed all iterations with `ans` remaining True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent checks were met during the loop execution. If any iteration found `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
