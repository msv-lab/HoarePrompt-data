Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is either 0 (if the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` is not greater than the initial `max`) or the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` (if it is greater than the initial `max`).***
