Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The approach taken in the program involves breaking down the integer into three parts that represent the positions of the letters in the alphabet. However, there are some issues with the logic used to achieve this:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to construct the word by subtracting large values first, which does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 24`, the program might incorrectly choose 'z' (26) and then adjust, rather than starting with the smallest possible values.

2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` at the end does not necessarily produce the lexicographically smallest word. The order of the letters matters, and sorting can disrupt the correct order needed to form the smallest word.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Small Values**: The logic for handling small values (e.g., `lex < 28`) is flawed. It always appends 1 and subtracts 1, which is not always the correct approach. For example, for `n = 3`, the correct word is "aaa" (1+1+1), but the program might incorrectly handle this.

4. **Handling of Remaining Value**: The remaining value `lex` is appended directly to the array without considering its position in the word. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the remaining value is large.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
