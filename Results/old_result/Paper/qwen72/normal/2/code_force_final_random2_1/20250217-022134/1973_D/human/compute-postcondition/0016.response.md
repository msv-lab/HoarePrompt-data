The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n-2`. Since the loop condition is `i > 0`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again (because `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.
