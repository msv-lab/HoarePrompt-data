Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` must be equal to the initial value of `casos`, `c` is `casos - 1`, and `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The value of `n` remains unchanged for each iteration based on the input provided.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `c` will have reached the value `casos - 1`, as it increments by 1 with each iteration starting from 0. The value of `casos` remains unchanged from its initial value, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `n` is determined by the input provided during each iteration and remains unchanged for each specific iteration. The loop will have printed the corresponding pattern for each value of `n` provided, but the final state of `n` will be the last input value received before the loop terminated.
