The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. It shifts `val` right by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the bit at position `i` of `val`. This bit is then XORed with `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element
- `val` is the first element of `a`
- `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 29
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1
- `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value
- `op` is 0
- `cnt` is 0

Let's calculate the new value of `op`:
- `val >> i` shifts `val` right by 29 positions.
- `val >> i & 1` extracts the bit at position 29 of `val`.
- `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` with the result of the XOR operation.

Since `op` is initially 0, the new value of `op` will be the bit at position 29 of `val`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `x` is updated to the value returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (denoted as `u`) is 1, `v` is even and currently has a non-zero value, `op` is the bit at position 29 of `val`, `cnt` is 0.**
