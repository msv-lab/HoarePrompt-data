The provided code snippet updates the list `a` by taking a space-separated sequence of integers as input from the user and converting them into a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values of consecutive pairs of elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
