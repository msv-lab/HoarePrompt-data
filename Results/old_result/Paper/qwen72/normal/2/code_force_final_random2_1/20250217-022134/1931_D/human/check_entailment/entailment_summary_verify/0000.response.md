### Reasoning:

The original assessment points out a critical flaw in the program: it does not ensure that the first index \(i\) is less than the second index \(j\) for the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\). This is indeed a significant issue because the problem statement explicitly requires \(i < j\).

Let's break down the function `func_1` and analyze its behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the parameters \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\) and the array \(a\).
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).
   - It initializes a variable `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Iterating Over the Array**:
   - For each number in the array \(a\), it calculates the remainders when the number is divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It calculates the required remainders for a pair to be considered beautiful.
   - It checks if the required remainders have been seen before in the `freq` dictionary and increments the `beautiful_count` accordingly.
   - It updates the `freq` dictionary with the current remainders.

4. **Output and Results**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Issue Analysis:

The key issue is that the function does not enforce the condition \(i < j\). Specifically, the function counts pairs without considering the order of indices. This means that for any pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\), it will also count the pair \(\langle j, i \rangle\) as a separate pair, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Correct Solution:

To fix this issue, the function should only count pairs where the first index is less than the second index. One way to achieve this is to use a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(i < j\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
                    print(f'Found beautiful pair: ({a[i]}, {a[j]})')
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the original assessment and the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle the condition \(i < j\), leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
