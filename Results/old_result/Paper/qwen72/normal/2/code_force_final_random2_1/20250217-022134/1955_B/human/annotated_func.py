#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `k` is `n`, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `n^2` elements, where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'.
    #State: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `k` is `n`, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `n^2` elements, where each element is `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` is now sorted in ascending order, and `l` is not equal to `li`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It checks if the list `l` can be transformed into a new list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, with `a` being the minimum value in `l`. If the sorted version of `l` matches the sorted `li`, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function ensures that the final state of the program includes `n` remaining an integer within the specified range, `k` and `h` being the last values used in the loop, and `li` containing `n^2` elements in a specific pattern.
