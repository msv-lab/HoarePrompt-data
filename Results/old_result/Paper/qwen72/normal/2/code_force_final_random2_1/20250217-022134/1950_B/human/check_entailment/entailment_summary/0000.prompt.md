Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

# Program:

    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `casos` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ casos ≤ 20`. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) and prints a pattern of `#` and `.` characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 grid of `##`. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 grid with a specific pattern. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `casos` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its last input value for each test case.
