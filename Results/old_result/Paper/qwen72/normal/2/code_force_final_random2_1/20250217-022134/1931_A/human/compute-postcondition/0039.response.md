Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `lex` and `arr` are updated based on the following conditions: If `lex` < 28, `lex` is decremented by 1 and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` ≥ 28 and `lex` < 52 or `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` is decremented by 26 and `arr` is set to [26]. Otherwise, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.***
