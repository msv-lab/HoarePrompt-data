The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, or `i`, but it does modify the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the current value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the new value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
