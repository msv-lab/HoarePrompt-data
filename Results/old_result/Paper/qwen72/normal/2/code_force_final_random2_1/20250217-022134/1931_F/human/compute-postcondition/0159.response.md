Output State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is `a2`, and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is `a1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
