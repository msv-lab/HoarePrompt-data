To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input.
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `suma` is `a - 1` if `a - 1 > 0` otherwise `suma` is 0.
   - `x` is `a`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `i * (i - 1)` evaluates to `2 * (2 - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`.
   - `i ** 2` evaluates to `2 ** 2 = 4`.
   - The expression `(a - 2) // 4 + 1` is evaluated.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Let's denote `a` as the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - The expression `(a - 2) // 4 + 1` is calculated as follows:
     - Subtract 2 from `a`: `a - 2`.
     - Perform integer division by 4: `(a - 2) // 4`.
     - Add 1 to the result: `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

4. **Update `x`:**
   - The new value of `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `t` is 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `suma` is `a - 1` if `a - 1 > 0` otherwise `suma` is 0.
- `x` is now `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is `a - 1` if `a - 1 > 0` otherwise `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**
