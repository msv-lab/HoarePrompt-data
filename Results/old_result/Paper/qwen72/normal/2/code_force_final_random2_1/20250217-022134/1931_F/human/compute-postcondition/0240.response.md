Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `a3` and `l3` based on the new input.
- `a3` is now the first integer from the new input.
- `l3` is now a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 3.
- The value of `val` remains a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state, as the code does not modify `val`.
