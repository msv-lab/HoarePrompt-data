You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, M is an empty list if w is not an integer or w < x - 1. If w is an integer and w ≥ x - 1, M is a list containing the integer w, where w is the square root of q.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `q` and `x` remain integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). The variable `w` is the integer square root of `q`, and `i` is equal to `w`. The list `M` contains all integers `i` (from 1 to `w-1`) that are divisors of `q` and satisfy `i >= x - 1`, as well as their corresponding quotients `q // i` that also satisfy `q // i >= x - 1`.
    return M
    #The program returns the list `M` which contains all integers `i` from 1 to `w-1` that are divisors of `q` and satisfy `i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that also satisfy `q // i >= x - 1`. Here, `w` is the integer square root of `q`, and both `x` and `q` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\)) and returns a list `M` of pairs `(i, q // i)` where `i` is a divisor of `q` within the range from 1 to `w-1` (with `w` being the integer square root of `q`), and both `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `M` which contains all integers `i` from 1 to `w-1` that are divisors of `q` and satisfy `i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients `q // i` that also satisfy `q // i >= x - 1`. Here, `w` is the integer square root of `q`, and both `x` and `q` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
