To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

- Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. If the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 15, m // 10)`. `n` must be at least 18, and `m` must be at least 18.

Given the code snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `x` = 3
   - `y` = 3
   - `cnt` is already calculated based on the initial conditions and the GCD condition.

2. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Calculate `x + y`: \( x + y = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: \( (x + y) * x = 6 * 3 = 18 \)
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: \( (x + y) * y = 6 * 3 = 18 \)

3. **Minimum Calculation:**
   - Calculate `n // 18` and `m // 18`
   - Find the minimum of these two values: `min(n // 18, m // 18)`

4. **Update `cnt`:**
   - Add the result of the minimum calculation to `cnt`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `x` remains 3.
- `y` remains 3.
- `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 18, m // 18)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 18, m // 18)`.**
