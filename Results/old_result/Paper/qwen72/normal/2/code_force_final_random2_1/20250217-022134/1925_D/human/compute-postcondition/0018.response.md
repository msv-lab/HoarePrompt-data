Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.** 

The value of `gcd` is calculated using the `math.gcd` function, which finds the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
