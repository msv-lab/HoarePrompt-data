The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `m`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `m`. For the loop to execute again, `m - 2` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 3. Since the loop iterates over `m - 2`, for the next iteration, `m` must still be greater than 3 to ensure `m - 2` is greater than 0.

However, the variable `_` is a placeholder and does not retain any specific value between iterations. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `l22` and the condition for `m`:

State: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `m` must be greater than 3, and the program has waited for user input.**
