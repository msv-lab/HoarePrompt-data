The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines the number of times there are at least `k` matching elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and all elements of `b`. The function prints the total count of such occurrences for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables unchanged.
