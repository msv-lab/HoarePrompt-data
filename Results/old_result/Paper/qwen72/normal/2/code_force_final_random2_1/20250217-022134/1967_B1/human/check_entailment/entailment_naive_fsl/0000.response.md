Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `ans` is incorrect. The line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not accurately reflect the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). According to the problem description, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the program's logic will not correctly count these pairs.

Let's break down the issue:
- For \(b = 1\), the program correctly adds \(n\) to `ans` (since \(1 \leq a \leq n\)).
- For \(b = 2\), the program incorrectly adds \((n + 2) // (2 * 2)\) to `ans`, which is not the correct way to count valid pairs.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results.
