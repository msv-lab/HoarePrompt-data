Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\).
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input.
- `s` is a non-empty string input by the user.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
- `i` has iterated through all keys in `hmp`.
- `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - The user provides an integer `t` within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The user provides two integers `n` and `m` within the ranges \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\).
   - The user provides a string `s` which is non-empty.

2. **String `a` and Variable `_`:**
   - `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
   - `_` is set to 0, but it is not used in the given code snippet.

3. **Counter Object `hmp`:**
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

4. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated as the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
   - This means for each character `i` in `s` that appears fewer than `m` times, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose the user inputs:
- `t = 1` (though `t` is not used in the calculation)
- `n = 5`, `m = 3`
- `s = "ABACD"`

- `hmp` will be: `{'A': 2, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1}`

- For each character in `hmp`:
  - `A`: `hmp['A'] = 2` (less than `m = 3`), so `ans += 3 - 2 = 1`
  - `B`: `hmp['B'] = 1` (less than `m = 3`), so `ans += 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `C`: `hmp['C'] = 1` (less than `m = 3`), so `ans += 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `D`: `hmp['D'] = 1` (less than `m = 3`), so `ans += 3 - 1 = 2`

- Therefore, `ans = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7`

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all characters `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m - hmp[i] for all characters i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**
