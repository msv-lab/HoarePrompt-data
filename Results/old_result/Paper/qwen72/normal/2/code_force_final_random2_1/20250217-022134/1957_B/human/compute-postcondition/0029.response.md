Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to double the value of `temp` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`.
- After each iteration, `temp` is multiplied by 2, and `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop stops when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, and `i` will be the exponent of that power of 2.
