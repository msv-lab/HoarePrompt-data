Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, if `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, if `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter, and `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. `combined` is now `k+1` elements shorter, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is now `k+2` elements shorter, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `heap` now contains the last `k` elements of `combined` with the new `item` added and the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) removed, which is stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
