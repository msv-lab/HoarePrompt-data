Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `beautiful_count` (which is 0).
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element.
   - `num` is the first element of `a`.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `num` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   Suppose `a = [10, 20, 30]`, `x = 3`, and `y = 4`.
   - `num` is the first element of `a`, so `num = 10`.
   - `mod_x` is `10 % 3`, which is `1`.
   - `mod_y` is `10 % 4`, which is `2`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(3 - 1) % 3`, which is `2`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   The print statement will output the following values:
   - `Number: 10`
   - `mod_x: 1`
   - `mod_y: 2`
   - `required_mod_x: 2`
   - `required_mod_y: 2`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2**
