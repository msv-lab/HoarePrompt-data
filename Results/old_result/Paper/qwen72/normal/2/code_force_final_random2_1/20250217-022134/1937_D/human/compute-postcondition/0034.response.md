Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions). If `el` is '>', `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged, and `preOne` loses its last element. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` contains two elements [0, `i + 1`], and `ans[i]` is updated based on the relationship between `zr` and `ol`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, and `oneInd` changes. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, `suffZero` contains [0, `n`], and `ans[i]` is set to `n - (2 * the sum of the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1)`.***
