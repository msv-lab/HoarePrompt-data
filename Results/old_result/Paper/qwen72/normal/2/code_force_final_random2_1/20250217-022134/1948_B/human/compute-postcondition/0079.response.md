The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters defining the range, specifically `m - 1`, `0`, and `-1`. The loop iterates backwards, starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `m - 3`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` is True.**
