Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is set to 2 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` is set to 1 and `i` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
