The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to 10^18) as input. It prints 'YES' and the number 1 three times if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates a series of values and prints either 'NO' if the calculated sum `h` is less than `k`, or '2', 'YES', and the two elements of the list `costs` if `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value in any case.
