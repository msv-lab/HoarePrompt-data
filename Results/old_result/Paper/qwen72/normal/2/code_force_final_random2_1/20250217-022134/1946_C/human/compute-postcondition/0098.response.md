The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers read from input, so the new values of `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.**
