The function `func_1()` is called, but without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, since no changes to variables are specified within the code snippet, we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any global variables or the state of the program.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 2 < `numero_testes` <= 10^4**
