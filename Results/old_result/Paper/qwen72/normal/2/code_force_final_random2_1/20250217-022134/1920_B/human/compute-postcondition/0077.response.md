Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it.
- Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1, so `a[1]` is added to `sums`.
- Therefore, the new value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
