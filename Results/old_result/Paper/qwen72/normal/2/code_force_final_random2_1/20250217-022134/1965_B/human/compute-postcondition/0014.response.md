Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 1, `i` is 2**. 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`, which results in `idx` being 1 since `i` was initially 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
