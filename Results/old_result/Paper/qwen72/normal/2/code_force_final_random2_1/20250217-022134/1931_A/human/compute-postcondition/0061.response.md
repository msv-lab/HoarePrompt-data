Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]], `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `arr` is [26]. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is an integer where 2 ≤ lex ≤ 25. If `lex` ≥ 52, `info` is updated to [[26, 26, lex - 78]], and `lex` is an integer where 2 ≤ lex ≤ 52.***
