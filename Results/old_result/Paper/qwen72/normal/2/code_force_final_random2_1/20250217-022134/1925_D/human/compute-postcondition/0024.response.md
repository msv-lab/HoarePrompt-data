Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sum_f` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the sum of all `f` values input during the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
