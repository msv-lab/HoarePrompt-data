It seems there was a misunderstanding. The provided code snippet is a decorator template and does not relate to the problem described. Let's focus on the actual problem and provide the correct precondition for a relevant function.

Given the problem description, let's consider a function that might be part of the solution to help Kirill determine the optimal number of mushrooms to gather and the maximum strength of the elixir.

### Problem Description
Kirill needs to gather mushrooms to make an elixir. The strength of the elixir is the product of the number of mushrooms and the minimum magic power among the gathered mushrooms. The magic power of certain mushrooms can become zero based on the permutation `p`.

### Function
Let's consider a function that calculates the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed:

```python
def max_elixir_strength(v, p):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

### Precondition
**v is a list of integers where 1 <= len(v) <= 200,000 and 1 <= v_i <= 10^9. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to len(v).**

This precondition ensures that the input parameters `v` and `p` meet the constraints specified in the problem description, allowing the function to operate correctly.
