Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user minus 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`) retain their initial values or conditions.
- The value of `m` is now `n - num`, reflecting the result of subtracting the total number of increments from `n`.
