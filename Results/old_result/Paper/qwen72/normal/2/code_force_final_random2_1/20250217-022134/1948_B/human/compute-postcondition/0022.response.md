The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` performs the following actions:

1. It converts the integer at index `i - 1` in the list `arr` to a string.
2. It iterates over each character in this string, converting each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
3. It appends the integer at index `i` in the list `arr` to this list of integers.
4. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `m - 3`, and `i` must be greater than 0

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `i` is `m - 3`, and since `i` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 4.
- `arr[i - 1]` is an integer from the list `arr`.
- Converting `arr[i - 1]` to a string and then to a list of integers results in a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]`.
- `arr[i]` is appended to this list of digits.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `m` is at least 4 (since `i` must be greater than 0)
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `m - 3`
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
