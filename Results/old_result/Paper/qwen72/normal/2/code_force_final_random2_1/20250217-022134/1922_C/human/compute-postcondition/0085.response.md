To solve this, let's break down the given code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `v` is `y - x`
   - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - The first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`.
   - The third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`.
   - The fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements to it.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `1` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `1`.

4. **Calculating the New Elements:**
   - The first new element appended to `b` is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
   - The second new element appended to `b` is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

### Output State Calculation:

- **Initial State:**
  - `v` is `y - x`
  - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
  - The first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`.
  - The second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`.
  - The third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`.
  - The fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`.

- **After Execution:**
  - `b` is updated by appending two new elements:
    - The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
    - The second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`v` is `y - x`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`, the second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`, the third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`, the fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`, `b` is updated by appending `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` and `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` to it.**
