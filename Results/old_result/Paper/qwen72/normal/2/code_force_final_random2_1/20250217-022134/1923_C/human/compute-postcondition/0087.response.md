Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l` + m - 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`. For each iteration, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. After `m` iterations, `_` will be equal to `m`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variables `a` and `b` are read from user input at the start of each iteration, so their values change with each iteration but do not affect the final state of other variables.
- The condition checks and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the cumulative sums in `p`. These conditions are evaluated for each iteration but do not alter the state of the variables outside the loop.
