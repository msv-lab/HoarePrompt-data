#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

    #State: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). The list `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1`, where each element has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, starting from the initial state where `dp[n]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, the loop updates `dp` such that for each index `j` in the range [0, 2 * n], if `dp[j]` was greater than 0 at any point, the adjacent elements `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. After `n` iterations, the final state of `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of these updates. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it is overwritten in each iteration.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value stored at the index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. Here, `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `p[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `p` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but assumed to be part of the context leading to `final_sum`), and `offset` is a value that is also not explicitly defined but is part of the calculation for `final_sum`. The list `dp` has a length of `2 * n + 1`, and its elements have been updated according to certain loop rules, which are not detailed here. The exact value returned depends on the specific values of `p[-1]`, `offset`, and the updates made to `dp` during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies |p_i| ≤ n, representing the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array `a`. It initializes a list `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index `n` (the `offset`), which is set to 1. The function then iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` list based on the values of the current `dp` list and the modulo operation with a constant `MOD`. After the loop completes, the function calculates `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and the `offset`. The function returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` list. The final state of the program includes the updated `dp` list and the returned value, which represents the result of the dynamic programming process applied to the input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, then calling another function `func_1` with `n` and `p`. The results of these calls are collected and printed one by one. After the function completes, the input data remains unchanged, and the results of the test cases are printed to the standard output.
