Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop (either being the greatest or the smallest depending on the conditions), `b` will be the second-to-last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop, and `c` will be the count of how many times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution. The value of `x` will be `n`, and `y` will remain the index where the initial condition `l[y] > l[y-1]` was first met or `n-1` if never met. The value of `n` remains unchanged.**
