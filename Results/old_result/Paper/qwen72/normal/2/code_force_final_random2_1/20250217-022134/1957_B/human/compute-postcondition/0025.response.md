Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Initially, `temp` is 2 (as given in the precondition). After executing the code, `temp` becomes 4. The value of `i` remains 1, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
