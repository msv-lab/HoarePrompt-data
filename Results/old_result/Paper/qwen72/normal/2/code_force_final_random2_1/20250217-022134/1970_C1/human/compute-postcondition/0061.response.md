Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input.
- `empty` is False.
- `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers representing the nodes of a tree structure, with the first and last elements being the endpoints of the longest path in the tree.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
- `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.
- All elements in `moves` are even.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Hermione')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
