Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing three elements. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is set (i.e., 1), `s` is `['1', '1', '1']` if the bit at position 0 in `x` is set, or `['0', '0', '1']` if the bit at position 0 in `x` is not set. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is not set, `s` is `['1', '1', '0']` if the bit at position 0 in `x` is set, or `['0', '0', '0']` if the bit at position 0 in `x` is not set.***
