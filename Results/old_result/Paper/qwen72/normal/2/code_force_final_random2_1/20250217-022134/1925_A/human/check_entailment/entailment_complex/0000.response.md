Reasoning:

The provided solution generates a string by taking the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeating this sequence `n` times. However, this approach does not necessarily ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

### Issues with the Provided Solution:
1. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem requires that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets must be subsequences of the generated string `s`. The current solution simply repeats the first `k` letters `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_1` is called inside a loop for each test case, but the function itself does not handle the input for multiple test cases. It reads `n` and `k` from the input each time it is called, which is correct, but the logic inside the function is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. One way to achieve this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of a given length appears as a substring.

However, a simpler approach for small values of `n` and `k` (as given in the constraints) is to generate a string that includes all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` letters. This can be done by generating all possible strings of length `n` and concatenating them, ensuring that the resulting string is the shortest possible.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters
    from itertools import product
    all_combinations = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    # Concatenate all combinations to form the result string
    result = ''.join(all_combinations)
    
    return result

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)
```

This solution generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and concatenates them to form the result string. This ensures that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of the generated string.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not meet the requirements of the problem, as it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of the generated string.

Correctness: **False**
