Output State: **`i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` remains greater than 0, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `bets - 1`**: The loop iterates from `0` to `bets - 1`, so after the last iteration, `i` will be `bets - 1`.
- **`bets` remains greater than 0**: The loop can only execute if `bets` is greater than 0, and this condition remains true throughout the loop.
- **`ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`**: After each iteration, the string representation of `a[i]` is appended to `ans` followed by a space. By the end of the loop, `ans` will contain the string representations of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, separated by spaces.
