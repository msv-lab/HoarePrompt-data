Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists where `final` now contains the first element of `lst` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`) and the second element of `lst`. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.**
