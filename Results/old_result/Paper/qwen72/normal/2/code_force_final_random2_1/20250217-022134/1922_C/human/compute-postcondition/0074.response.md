To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`.
   - Remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Set to the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `u` is now `u - 3` and must evaluate to a truthy value.

4. **New values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Returned by `r()`.
   - If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Understanding `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index in list `b` based on the value of `d`.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` calculates the index in list `b` based on the value of `c`.

3. **Accessing Elements in List `b`**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` accesses the element in list `b` at the index `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` accesses the element in list `b` at the index `(c - 1) * 2`.

4. **Subtraction**:
   - The difference between these two elements is calculated: `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the elements at the specified indices in list `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `b` is the list that has grown by `2 * (n - 3)` elements, and `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`)**
