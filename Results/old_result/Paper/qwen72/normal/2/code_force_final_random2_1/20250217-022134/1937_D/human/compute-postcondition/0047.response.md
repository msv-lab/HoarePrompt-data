Output State: **`preOne` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre` up to each index, starting with an initial value of 0, but missing its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.
- The initial state specifies that `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, and it may be missing its last element if `el` is '>'.
- After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed, so `preOne` is now missing its last element.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`) remain unchanged.
