Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, indicating the positions where `l1` and `l2` differ by `a1` and `a2`. `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on whether a mismatch was found and adjusted. The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early due to conditions being met. `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is non-negative, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`, indicating that `l2` differs from `l1` by `a2` at position `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a reference to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `l1` is updated with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2` or if `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l` is set to `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and `m` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `idx1 <= idx2` and `m` is not 1 and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` is updated with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and `l` is set to `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` (either as the only element or appended to the existing elements), `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the new tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it, `_` is 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and the new tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it, `_` is 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
