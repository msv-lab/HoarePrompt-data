The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, the new value of `k` is `k - s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is now `k - s` (which means `k` is now `k - min(m, k)`).**
