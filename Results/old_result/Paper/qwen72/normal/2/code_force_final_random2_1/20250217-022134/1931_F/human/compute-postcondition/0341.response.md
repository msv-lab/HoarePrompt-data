The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is at least 3
- `val` is an empty list
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input
- `a1` is the first integer from the user input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new user input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates)
- `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`
- `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered

After executing the code:
- The value of `a1` is inserted into the list `l1` at the position `idx2`.
- The length of `l1` increases by 1.
- All elements in `l1` that were originally at positions `idx2` and beyond are shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` now contains the value of `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates), `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.**
