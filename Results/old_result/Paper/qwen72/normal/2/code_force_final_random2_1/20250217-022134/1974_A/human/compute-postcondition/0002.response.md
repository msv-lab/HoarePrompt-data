The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the first part of the input, `b` is the second part of the input.**
