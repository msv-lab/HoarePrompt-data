Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k` already played, followed by the actual moves.

2. **Move Processing**: The function correctly processes the moves to count how many positions are occupied by rooks placed by the player and the computer. It increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `r == c`) and by 2 otherwise, which accounts for both the player's and the computer's moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The function sets up a dynamic programming array `dp` to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions on the board. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly initialized.

4. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of valid configurations for a board of size `i`. This formula accounts for the different ways to place rooks on the board while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]` where `m` is the number of remaining positions on the board.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 correctly by printing 0 or 1, respectively.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
