#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the number of sides of the polygon; x is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen; y is an integer equal to 0, representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = n - list0[-1]
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the last input integer, `x` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `y` is the last input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is equal to `T`, ensuring the loop has executed `T` times. If `num` is 1, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads and processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the number of sides of a polygon (`n`), the number of vertices chosen by Bessie (`x`), and a placeholder value (`y`). It also reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calculates and prints the number of additional vertices that can be chosen such that no two chosen vertices are adjacent. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` reflect the last processed test case.
