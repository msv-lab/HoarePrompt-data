Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer.
- `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part (first two characters).
   - `m` is the minute part (last two characters).

2. **Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged.

3. **Formatting the Output:**
   - The hour `h` is formatted to a two-digit number using `{h:02d}`.
   - The minute `m` is formatted to a two-digit number using `{m:02d}`.
   - The `day` part is appended to the formatted time.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = "13:45"`:
- `h = 13`
- `m = 45`
- Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` is set to `13 - 12 = 1` and `day` is set to 'PM'.

The print statement will output:
```python
print(f'{1:02d}:{45:02d}', 'PM')
```
This will be formatted as:
```
01:45 PM
```

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
- The hour `h` formatted to a two-digit number.
- The minute `m` formatted to a two-digit number.
- The `day` part ('AM' or 'PM') based on the conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the adjusted hour, m is the minute, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions)**

For example, if `s = "13:45"`, the output will be:
Output: **01:45 PM**
