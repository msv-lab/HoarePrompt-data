The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `m * f`, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
