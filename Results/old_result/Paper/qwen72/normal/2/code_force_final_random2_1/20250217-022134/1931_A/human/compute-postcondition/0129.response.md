The code snippet `info.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, which itself is determined by the input integer and the conditions specified. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 2.
- `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

Depending on the value of `lex`:
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1, 1, lex] and `lex` is the input integer minus 2.
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `lex` is now `lex - 52` (which is between -24 and 26).
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26, 26, lex] and `lex` is `lex - 52` (which is between 0 and 26).
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` is [lex] and `lex` is the input integer.

Since `info.append(arr)` only appends `arr` to `info`, the values of `n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `info` list, which now includes the new `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and `lex` remains the same as before the code execution.**
