Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.**
