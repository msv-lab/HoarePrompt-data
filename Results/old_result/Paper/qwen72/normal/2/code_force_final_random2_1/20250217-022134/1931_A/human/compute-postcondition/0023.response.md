The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. However, regardless of the initial value of `arr`, appending 26 to it will modify `arr`.

Let's consider the different cases for `lex`:

1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is initially `[1]`.
2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is initially `[26]`.
3. If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is initially either an empty list (if `lex` > 78) or `[26]` (if `lex` ≤ 78).

After executing `arr.append(26)`, the new value of `arr` will be:

1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
2. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
3. If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` becomes `[26]` if `lex` > 78, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` ≤ 78.

The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is as described in the initial state, and `arr` is updated as follows:**
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` > 78, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` ≤ 78.
