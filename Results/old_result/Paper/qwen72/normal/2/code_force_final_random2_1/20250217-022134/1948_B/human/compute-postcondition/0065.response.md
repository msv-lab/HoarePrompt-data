Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by first converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appending the integer `arr[i]` to this list. The rest of the variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
