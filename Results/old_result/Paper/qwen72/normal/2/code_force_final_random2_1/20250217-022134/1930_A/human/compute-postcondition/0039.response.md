Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until the list is empty.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Remains greater than 1.
- **`i`**: Remains 1.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`numbers`**: After all iterations of the loop, the list `numbers` will be empty because each iteration removes two elements from the list.
- **`suma`**: The variable `suma` will hold the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list. This means that for every pair of integers `(a, b)` removed from `numbers`, the smaller of the two (`min(a, b)`) is added to `suma`. This process continues until `numbers` is empty.
