Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
