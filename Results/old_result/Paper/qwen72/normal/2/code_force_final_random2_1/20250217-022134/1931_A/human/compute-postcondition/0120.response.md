Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and [26] if `lex` > 78.**
