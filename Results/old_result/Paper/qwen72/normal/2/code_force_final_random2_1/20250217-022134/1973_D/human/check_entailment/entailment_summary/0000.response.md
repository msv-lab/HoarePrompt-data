Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same value of `f(l, r) = m`. The program uses a series of queries to interactively determine the structure of the hidden array and find the required value `m`.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **func_1**: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers. This function is not used in the main logic.
2. **func_2**: Reads an integer from the input. This function is used to read the responses to the queries.
3. **func_3**: Reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers. This function is used to read the initial values of `n` and `k`.
4. **func_4**: Reads a line of input and returns a stripped string. This function is not used in the main logic.
5. **func_5**: The main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

### Main Logic in `func_5`:
- **Initialization**: Reads `n` and `k` from the input.
- **Finding the Maximum Value `v`**:
  - Iterates from `n` down to `1`, querying `f(1, i * n)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
  - If `v == n`, it sets `v` to the current `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- **Checking Subarrays**:
  - Iterates over possible values of `i` from `1` to `n // k + 1`.
  - For each `i`, it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = i * v`.
  - If successful, it prints the value `i * v` and returns.
- **No Valid Split Found**:
  - If no valid split is found after all iterations, it prints `! -1`.

### Analysis:
- **Query Limit**: The function makes at most `2 * n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Correctness of Queries**: The queries are structured to find the maximum value `v` and then check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same value of `f(l, r)`.
- **Termination**: The function correctly handles the termination conditions and prints the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It adheres to the constraints and query limits, and the logic for finding the maximum value and checking subarrays is sound.

Correctness: **True**
