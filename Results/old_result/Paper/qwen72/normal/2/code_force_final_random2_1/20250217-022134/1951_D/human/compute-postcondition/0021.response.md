Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `2 * n`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1, and `n` is updated to `n - i * (n // i)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to the integer division of `n` by `i`.
- Given that `i` is 1, `n // i` simplifies to `n // 1`, which is just `n`.
- Therefore, `curr` is now equal to `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `curr` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same.
