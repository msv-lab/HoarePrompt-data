To determine what will be printed when the `print(suma)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `numCases` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until the list is empty.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` and `numCases` are not directly used in the `print(suma)` statement, so they do not affect the output.
   - `i` is set to 2, but it is not used in the `print(suma)` statement either.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer, but it is not added to the `numbers` list in the given context.
   - `numbers` is an empty list, which means there are no elements in it to form pairs.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs to form, and thus `suma` will be 0.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - When the `print(suma)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `suma`.
   - Since `numbers` is empty, `suma` will be 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(suma)` statement will be:
Output: **0**
