To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}\), representing the initial number of cards of each type.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ii in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`, which means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
- The variable `ii` is the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `int(input()) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- The variable `ii` should start at 0.

### Final State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `ii` is 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
