Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is now equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` to be equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `i` is 2, the condition for updating `sums` is met, and `sums` is set to the calculated value. All other variables remain unchanged.
