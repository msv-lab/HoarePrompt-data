Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n` is the last processed integer value from `data`, `p` is the last processed list of `n` integers, `data` remains the same as it was initially, `index` is the final position after processing all elements, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` is 0 because it has been fully consumed by the loop.
- The variable `n` holds the last integer value processed from the `data` list.
- The variable `p` holds the last list of integers processed, which corresponds to the last `n`.
- The `data` list remains unchanged from its initial state.
- The `index` variable holds the final position in the `data` list after all elements have been processed.
- The `results` list contains all the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The `result` variable holds the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration of the loop.
