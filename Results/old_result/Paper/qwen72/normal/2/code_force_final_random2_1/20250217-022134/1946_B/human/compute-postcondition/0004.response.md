The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts using spaces as separators, and then maps each part to an integer, converting the resulting map object into a list.

- `a` is now a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.**
