Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list with length `n-3` appended to the initial `[0, 0]` and each element in `b` from index 2 onwards is calculated as `b[i] = b[i-2] + (y - x)`, `u` is a truthy value (greater than 0) decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0, `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the condition `c >= d` holds true.**
