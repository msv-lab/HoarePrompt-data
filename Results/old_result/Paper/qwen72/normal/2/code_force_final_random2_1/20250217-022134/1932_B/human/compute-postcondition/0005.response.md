To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`n`, `path`, `data`, `index`, `results`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `path` is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
