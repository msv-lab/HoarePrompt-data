The code snippet `num -= 1` decreases the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `num` is only decreased if `i` (which is the second element of `no`) meets the condition of being less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`. If this condition is met, `num` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

Since the condition is not explicitly stated to be true or false, we assume the condition is met as per the given code snippet, which means `num` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `num` is decreased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**
