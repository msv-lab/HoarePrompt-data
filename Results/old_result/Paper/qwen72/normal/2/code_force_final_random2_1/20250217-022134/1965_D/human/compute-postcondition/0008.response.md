The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last two elements already removed, removing another element means that `smallList` now has its last three elements removed. Additionally, the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`, which remains true after the operation.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` with its last three elements removed, and the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
