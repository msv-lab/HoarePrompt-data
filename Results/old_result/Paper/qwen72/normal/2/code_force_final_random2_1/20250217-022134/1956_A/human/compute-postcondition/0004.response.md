The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of integers where each integer is unique and in ascending order (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100), and `b` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Case_1: If the operation `a - 1` is attempted, the function returns an error because the subtraction operator cannot be applied directly to a list of integers.

Case_2: If the operation `a - 1` is not attempted, the function returns the list `b`, indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`. If an invalid operation like `a - 1` is attempted, it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`, indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.**
