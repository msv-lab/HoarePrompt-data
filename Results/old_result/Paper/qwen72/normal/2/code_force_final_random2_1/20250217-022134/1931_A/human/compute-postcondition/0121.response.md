The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The conditions described in the initial state determine the initial value of `arr` and the value of `lex`. However, the code snippet itself only affects the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer

After executing `arr.append(26)`, the list `arr` will have an additional element 26 appended to it. The value of `lex` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is now [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and [26] if `lex` > 78.**
