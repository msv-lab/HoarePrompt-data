Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k` elements shorter.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `test_cases` remains greater than 0.
- The `heap` now contains the last `k` elements from the original `combined` list, in the order they were popped.
- The `remaining_items` list remains empty.
- The variables `n` and `k` retain their values as assigned by `func_2()`.
- The `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` lists remain unchanged.
- The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables remain 0.
- The `combined` list is now `k` elements shorter, as the last `k` elements have been removed and pushed into the `heap`.
