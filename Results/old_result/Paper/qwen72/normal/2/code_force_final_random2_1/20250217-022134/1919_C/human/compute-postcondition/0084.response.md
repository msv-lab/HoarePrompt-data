Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is 1. If the second element of `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`), then `b` is set to the second element of `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
