The code snippet `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` initializes the entry for the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` with the value `0`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- The dictionary `freq` now contains the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with the value `0`.
- The values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are derived from the variables `num`, `x`, and `y` as follows:
  - `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
  - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- The tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in the dictionary `freq` before this assignment, so this is the first time it is being added.

All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `beautiful_count`, `num`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). `results` is an empty list. `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` set to `0`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
