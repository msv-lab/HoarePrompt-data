The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `3`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute 3 times regardless of the values of `n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, `i`, or `temp`. However, for the loop to start, `j` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 0, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
