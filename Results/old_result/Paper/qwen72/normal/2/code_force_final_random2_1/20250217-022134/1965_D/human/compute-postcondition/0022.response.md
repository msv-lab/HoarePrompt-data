Output State: **`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `odds` must have at least one more element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- All other variables (`prev`, `x`, `idx`, and `a[idx]`) retain their previous values.
- The condition that `odds` must have at least one more element remains unchanged.
