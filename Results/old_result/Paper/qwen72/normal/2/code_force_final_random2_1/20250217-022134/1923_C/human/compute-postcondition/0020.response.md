The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value at index `a - 2` in the list `p` from the variable `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`
- `x` is the last integer in the list `l`
- `_` is a throwaway variable
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` and `b` are integers read from user input
- `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`
- `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0

After executing the code:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `s` is now equal to the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1` minus the value at index `a - 2` in the list `p`, and `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0.**
