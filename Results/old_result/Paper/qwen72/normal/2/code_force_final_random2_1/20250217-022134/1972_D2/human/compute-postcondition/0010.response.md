To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Current State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is 1.

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **First Condition: `(x + y) * x <= n`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(1 + 2) * 1 = 3 <= n`
   - This condition is true if `n` is at least 3.

2. **Second Condition: `(x + y) * y <= m`**
   - Substituting the current values: `(1 + 2) * 2 = 6 <= m`
   - This condition is true if `m` is at least 6.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
- The current values of `x` and `y` are fixed, so we cannot change them.
- We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 and `m` is at least 6.

### Conclusion:
Since the current state already satisfies the conditions (as `n` and `m` are at least 2, and we need them to be at least 3 and 6 respectively), no adjustments are needed to the state variables `x`, `y`, or `cnt`.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input and must be at least 2, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 1**.
