The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
