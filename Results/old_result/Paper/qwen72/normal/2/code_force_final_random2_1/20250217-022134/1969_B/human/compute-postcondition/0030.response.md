The code snippet initializes the list `cnt` to `[0, 0]`. This means that both `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` are set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) are not affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is the sum of the number of times 0 appears in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it, plus the number of times 1 appears in `s` multiplied by the number of times 0 appears in `s` minus the number of times 0 has been counted so far, `n` is now `n - 1`.**
