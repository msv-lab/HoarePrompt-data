Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates files for HTML files within a specified range of folder names. However, the provided program defines a completely different function `func_1` that reads input from the user and performs a different set of operations related to counting occurrences of '1' in a string and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This program does not perform the task described in the problem statement, hence it is incorrect.
