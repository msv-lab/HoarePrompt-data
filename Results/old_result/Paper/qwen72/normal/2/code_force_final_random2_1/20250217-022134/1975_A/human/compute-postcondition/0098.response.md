Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both).

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Explanation:
- The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly.
- The print statement is a simple string literal and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
