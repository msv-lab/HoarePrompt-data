Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
