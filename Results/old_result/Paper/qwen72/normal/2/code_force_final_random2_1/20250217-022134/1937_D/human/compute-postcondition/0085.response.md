To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the described conditions:

1. **String `s1`**: It is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
3. **List `pre`**: Contains the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
4. **Variable `totalOne`**: Is 0, indicating that all '>' characters have been processed.
5. **List `preOne`**: Is empty, as it has been popped for each '>' character encountered.
6. **List `suffZero`**: Contains `n + 1` elements, where each element represents the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string.
7. **List `ans`**: Is a list of length `n` where each element has been updated based on the conditions within the loop, reflecting the final result of the computation.

Given these conditions, the list `ans` has been fully populated with the results of the computation. Since the exact values of `s1` and the intermediate computations are not provided, we can only describe the final state of `ans` in general terms.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Each element in `ans` represents the result of the computation for the corresponding position in the string `s1`.

Output: **[ans[0]] [ans[1]] ... [ans[n-1]] (where each element in ans is the result of the computation for the corresponding position in the string s1)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing the computed value for the corresponding position in the string `s1`.
