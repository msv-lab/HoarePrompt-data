Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 2 * (a[2] - a[1]), `r` is equal to `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- The value of `k` remains decreased by 2 * (a[2] - a[1]).
- The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `r` is assigned the value of `a[2]`.
