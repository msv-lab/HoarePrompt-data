The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of list `a`, followed by a space, to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is converted to a string and appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.**
