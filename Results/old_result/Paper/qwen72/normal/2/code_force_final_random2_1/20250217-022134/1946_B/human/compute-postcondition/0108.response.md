Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**
