Postcondition: ***`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: If `l1[i + p1]` is `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is `a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, they are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is `a2`, `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` remains -1, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not `a2`, `idx1` remains -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is set to 1. In all cases, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.***
