Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of the new input value of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). For all indices `j` from 1 to 29 (or 30), if `s[j]` is '-1' and `s[j-1]` is '1', then `s[j]` is now '0' and `s[j-1]` is now '-1'. This process continues until no more such pairs are found.**
