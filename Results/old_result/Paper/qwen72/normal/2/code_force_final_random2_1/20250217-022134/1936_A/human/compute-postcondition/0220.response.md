The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It interacts with a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the permutation. The function's goal is to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. The function is allowed to make no more than 3n queries to achieve this. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, the length of the permutation n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find a pair of indices (i, j) in a secret permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries.**
