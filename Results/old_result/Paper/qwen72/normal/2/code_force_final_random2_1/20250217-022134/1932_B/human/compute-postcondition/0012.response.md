Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 2 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the element at index 3 in the `data` list.
- All other variables (`t`, `path`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
