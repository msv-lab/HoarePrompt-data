The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range determined by the user's input. The number of times the loop will execute is determined by the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide an input that converts to an integer greater than 0. Since the loop does not depend on the values of `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, or `pans`, these values remain unchanged at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
