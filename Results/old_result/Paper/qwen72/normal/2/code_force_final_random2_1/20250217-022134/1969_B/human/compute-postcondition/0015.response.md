The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is initially `[1, 0]` and `ans` is 0. After executing the code, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[2, 0]`.
- If `c` is not 0, then `cnt` is initially `[0, 1]` and `ans` is `zeroes`. After executing the code, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` `[0, 2]`.

The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is `[2, 0]` and `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `cnt` is `[0, 2]` and `ans` is `zeroes`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.**
