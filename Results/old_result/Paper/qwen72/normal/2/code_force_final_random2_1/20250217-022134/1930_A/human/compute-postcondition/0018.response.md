Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with six fewer elements and must contain at least one element, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is `3 * min(a, b)`**.

Explanation:
- The initial value of `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`.
- The code `suma += min(a, b)` adds `min(a, b)` to `suma`.
- Therefore, the new value of `suma` is `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, which simplifies to `3 * min(a, b)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
