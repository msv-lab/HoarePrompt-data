The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`. The loop iterates over each character in `expression`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `expression` needs to be considered.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-".
- `char` is the first character of `expression`.
- If `char` is "+", `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The next character in `expression` will be the new `char`.
- The length of `expression` remains the same, but the effective part of the string being considered changes as the loop progresses.

Since the loop is iterating over the string, the next character in `expression` will be the second character, and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `char` is the second character of `expression`. If `char` is "+", `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
