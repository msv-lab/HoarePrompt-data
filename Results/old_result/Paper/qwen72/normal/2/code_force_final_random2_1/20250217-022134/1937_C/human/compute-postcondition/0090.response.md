Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is 0, and if the new `r` is '>', `prev` is updated to `i` and the current value of `r` remains '>'. If the new `r` is not '>', the current value of `r` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the new user input.
- All other variables (`n`, `I`, `R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `prev` and the value of `r` if the new input is '>' is still valid.
- The output buffer has already been flushed and remains in that state.
