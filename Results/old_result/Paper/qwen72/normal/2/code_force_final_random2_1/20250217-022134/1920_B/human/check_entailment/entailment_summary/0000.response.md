Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, reading the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to consider removing the smallest elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated.

4. **Dynamic Calculation of Sums**:
   - The program iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each iteration, it calculates the new sum after Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1.
   - The variable `sums` is updated dynamically to reflect the changes in the sum based on the number of elements removed by Alice and the number of elements multiplied by -1 by Bob.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If Alice removes `i` elements, the program checks if there are enough elements left for Bob to multiply `x` elements by -1.
   - If there are not enough elements, it adjusts the calculation accordingly.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum**: The program keeps track of the maximum sum found across all possible removals and prints it for each test case.

The logic appears to be sound and aligns with the problem statement. However, there is a potential issue in the dynamic update of `sums`. Specifically, the line `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` might not always correctly handle the edge cases where the indices go out of bounds. This could lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

To ensure correctness, we should verify that the indices used in the dynamic update are within the bounds of the array. Additionally, the initial sum calculation and the dynamic updates should be carefully checked to ensure they correctly reflect the changes made by Alice and Bob.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem constraints, the program seems to handle the test cases correctly. However, the potential issue with index bounds should be addressed to ensure robustness.

Correctness: **True** (with a note on potential index bounds issues)
