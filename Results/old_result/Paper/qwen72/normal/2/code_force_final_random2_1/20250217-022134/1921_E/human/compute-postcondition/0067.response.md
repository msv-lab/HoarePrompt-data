Postcondition: **`t` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x_a + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
