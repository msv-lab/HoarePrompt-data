To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Current State of These Variables:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n` (since `permutation` is a list of length `n`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
   - Given the current state, this translates to `2 < n`.

4. **Check the Initial Constraints:**
   - We know that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.
   - Since `n` is at least 2 (from the constraint `2 <= k <= n`), the condition `2 < n` is already satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since `2 < n` is already true given the constraints, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.**
