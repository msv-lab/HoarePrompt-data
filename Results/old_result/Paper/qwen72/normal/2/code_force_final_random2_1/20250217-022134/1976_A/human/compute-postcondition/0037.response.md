The code concatenates the `digits` list and the `letters` list, and then joins them into a single string `sortedPassword`.

- `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order.
- `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password` string.
- `i` is `len(digits) - 1`.

The `sortedPassword` is now a string that combines all the digits followed by all the letters from the `password` string.

Output State: **`password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` list contains all the digits from the `password` string in sorted ascending order, `letters` list contains all the letters from the `password` string, `i` is `len(digits) - 1`, `sortedPassword` is a string that combines all the digits from `digits` followed by all the letters from `letters`.**
