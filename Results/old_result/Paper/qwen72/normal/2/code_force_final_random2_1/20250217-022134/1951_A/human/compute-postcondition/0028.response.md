Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state remains unchanged. If `cnt1` > 2 and (`cnt1` % 2 == 1 or `cnt1` == 1), the state remains unchanged. If '11' is in `s`, the state remains unchanged. In all other cases, the state remains unchanged.***
