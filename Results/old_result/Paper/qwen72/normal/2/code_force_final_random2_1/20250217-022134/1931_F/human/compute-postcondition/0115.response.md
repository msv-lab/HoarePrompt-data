Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, where each `a3` is the first integer from the corresponding new input, and each `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the corresponding new input.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, so `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- After all iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each representing the first integer and the list of remaining integers from each new input.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
