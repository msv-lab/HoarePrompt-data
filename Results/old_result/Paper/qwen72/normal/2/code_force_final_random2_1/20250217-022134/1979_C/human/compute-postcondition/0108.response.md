The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints, it appears to process multiple test cases, each with a set of outcomes and their respective multipliers. The function likely accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n` for each test case, and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` for each outcome.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes.
- `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result of some computation involving the multipliers for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n` for each test case, and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` for each outcome. It processes these inputs and returns the result of a computation involving the multipliers for each test case.**
