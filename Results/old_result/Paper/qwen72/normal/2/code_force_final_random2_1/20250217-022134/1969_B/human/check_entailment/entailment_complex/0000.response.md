Reasoning:

The function `func_1` aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The approach taken in the function involves counting the number of '0's and '1's in the string and calculating the cost based on the positions of these characters.

1. **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Zeroes**: It counts the number of '0's in the string, which is necessary for the cost calculation.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is '0', it adds 1 to `ans` if there have been any '1's encountered before (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is '1', it adds the difference between the total number of '0's and the number of '0's encountered so far to `ans`.
4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated cost `ans` for each test case.

The logic behind the cost calculation is to account for the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's to achieve a sorted string. This is done by adding the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and the remaining '0's that need to be moved to the end.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the function appears to correctly implement the required logic and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
