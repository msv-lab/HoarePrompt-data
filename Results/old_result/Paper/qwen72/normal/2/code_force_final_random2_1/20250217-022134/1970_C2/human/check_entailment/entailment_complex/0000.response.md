### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game on a tree where nodes are initially inactive. The game is played over one round (since \( t = 1 \)).
   - Players take turns moving a stone from the current node to an inactive neighbor. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent)`**:
     - This function checks if the starting node `start` can lead to a winning position for the player whose turn it is.
     - It returns `False` if the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent).
     - Otherwise, it recursively checks the adjacent nodes (excluding the parent) and returns `True` if any of these adjacent nodes can lead to a losing position for the opponent.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the starting node.
     - It then calls `func_1` to check if the starting node leads to a winning position for Ron.
     - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Tree Construction**:
     - The tree is correctly constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
   - **Leaf Node Identification**:
     - Leaf nodes are identified correctly by checking if a node has only one neighbor.
   - **Winning Condition**:
     - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the starting node leads to a winning position. It uses recursion to explore all possible moves and returns `True` if any of these moves lead to a losing position for the opponent.
   - **Output**:
     - The output is correctly determined based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
