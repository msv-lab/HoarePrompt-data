Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is a list with `t` elements, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `_` is `n-1`, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists. `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists. `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. For each test case, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is `0`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `r` will contain `t` elements, each representing the result of the respective test case based on the conditions described. The variables `n`, `_`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` will reflect the state of the last iteration of the loop.
