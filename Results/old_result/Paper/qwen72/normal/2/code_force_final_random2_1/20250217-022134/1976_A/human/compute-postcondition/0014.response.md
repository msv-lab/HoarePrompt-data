The code appends the value of `char` to the list `letters`. Since `char` is the next character in `password`, which is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the list `letters` now includes this character. The initial state of `password` and `char` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the next character in `password`, `letters` now contains `char`.**
