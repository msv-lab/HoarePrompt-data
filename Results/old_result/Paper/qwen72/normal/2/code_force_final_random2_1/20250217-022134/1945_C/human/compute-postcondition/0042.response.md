Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- `zero` and `one` will accumulate the counts of '0's and '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character in the string `s`.
- `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated based on the current counts of '0's and '1's and the remaining characters in the string.
- `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, indicating that at those points, the percentage of '0's and the percentage of remaining '1's are both at least 50%.
