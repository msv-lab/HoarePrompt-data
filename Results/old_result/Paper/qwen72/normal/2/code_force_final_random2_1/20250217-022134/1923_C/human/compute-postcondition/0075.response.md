The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t`: An integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m`: Integers read from user input.
   - `l`: A list of integers derived from user input.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `x`: The last integer in the list `l`.
   - `_`: Incremented by the number of elements in `l` + 1.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from user input.
   - `m` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
