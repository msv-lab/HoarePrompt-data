The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cases`. The loop's execution depends on whether `i` is less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `cases` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr` is one of [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 26, lex], `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 52, or 52, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.**
