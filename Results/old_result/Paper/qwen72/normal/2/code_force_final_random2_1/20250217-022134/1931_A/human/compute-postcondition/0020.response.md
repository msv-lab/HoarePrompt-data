The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Since the range is `2`, the loop will execute again when `j` is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` between 2 and 26. If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is an empty list if `lex` > 78, otherwise `arr` is [26], and `lex` remains unchanged.**
