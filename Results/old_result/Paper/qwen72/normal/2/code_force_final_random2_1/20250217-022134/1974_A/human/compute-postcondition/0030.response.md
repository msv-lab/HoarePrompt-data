Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer representing the second part of the input, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `b // 2`. If `t % 2 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`. Regardless of the value of `t`, if `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is greater than or equal to `a`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t` is further updated as follows: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` becomes `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` remains `a - t1`. Additionally, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t2` is a multiple of 15; otherwise, `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.***
