Output State: **`a` remains a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenated string formed by the condition being met (if it was met) or the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the total number of iterations plus 2, `t` is `x + 1`, and the first character of `a[0]` matches the first character of `s`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
