The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

- `t` remains unchanged and must be at least 1.
- `_` remains unchanged and is a throwaway variable.
- `n` remains unchanged and is an input integer.
- `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
