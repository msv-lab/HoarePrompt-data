Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2 2
    
    2 3
    
    5 0
    
    0 1 2 2 1

Output

    2
    2
    1

    -1

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_3`. This function is designed to read input from the standard input, typically used to parse input data for further processing in the program.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into an integer. The input is taken from the standard input, and the elements are expected to be numerical strings that can be converted to integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user's input after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, x is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), and a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all 30 iterations from 29 down to 0. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under the conditions specified in the loop. The list `a` may be modified based on the operations performed within the loop, particularly when `u` is 0 and `v` is even, where elements of `a` are replaced with the XOR results of certain subsets. The list `t` will be reset to an empty list after each iteration where `u` is 0 and `v` is even, and it will be used to store intermediate results. The variables `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Here, `ans` holds the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under the conditions specified in the loop. The length of `a` is the number of elements in the list `a` after all modifications within the loop.
