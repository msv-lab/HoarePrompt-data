To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `permutation` list step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n` and `k`**: These are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
2. **`permutation`**: This is a list of length `n` where each element at index `j` is determined by the following rules:
   - If \(j \% k == 0\), then the element is \(j // k + 1\).
   - Otherwise, the element is \((j // k) * k + (j \% k) + 1\).

3. **`curr_v`**: This is set to `n + 1`.
4. **`i`**: This is set to `k`.
5. **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: This is set to \(k * (n // k) + k - 1\).
6. **`idx`**: This is set to 0.
7. **`idx_v`**: This is set to 1.
8. **`result`**: This is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

### Constructing the `permutation` List:
Let's construct the `permutation` list based on the rules provided:

- For each index `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - If \(j \% k == 0\), the element is \(j // k + 1\).
  - Otherwise, the element is \((j // k) * k + (j \% k) + 1\).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume \(n = 10\) and \(k = 2\) for simplicity.

- For \(j = 0\):
  - \(0 \% 2 == 0\), so the element is \(0 // 2 + 1 = 1\).
- For \(j = 1\):
  - \(1 \% 2 != 0\), so the element is \((1 // 2) * 2 + (1 \% 2) + 1 = 0 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 2\).
- For \(j = 2\):
  - \(2 \% 2 == 0\), so the element is \(2 // 2 + 1 = 2\).
- For \(j = 3\):
  - \(3 \% 2 != 0\), so the element is \((3 // 2) * 2 + (3 \% 2) + 1 = 1 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\).
- For \(j = 4\):
  - \(4 \% 2 == 0\), so the element is \(4 // 2 + 1 = 3\).
- For \(j = 5\):
  - \(5 \% 2 != 0\), so the element is \((5 // 2) * 2 + (5 \% 2) + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\).
- For \(j = 6\):
  - \(6 \% 2 == 0\), so the element is \(6 // 2 + 1 = 4\).
- For \(j = 7\):
  - \(7 \% 2 != 0\), so the element is \((7 // 2) * 2 + (7 \% 2) + 1 = 3 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 8\).
- For \(j = 8\):
  - \(8 \% 2 == 0\), so the element is \(8 // 2 + 1 = 5\).
- For \(j = 9\):
  - \(9 \% 2 != 0\), so the element is \((9 // 2) * 2 + (9 \% 2) + 1 = 4 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 10\).

So, the `permutation` list for \(n = 10\) and \(k = 2\) would be:
\[ [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 10] \]

### Constructing the `result` String:
The `result` string is constructed by joining the elements of the `permutation` list with spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the elements of the `permutation` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 2 4 3 6 4 8 5 10** (for \(n = 10\) and \(k = 2\))

For general \(n\) and \(k\), the output will be the elements of the `permutation` list constructed according to the rules described, separated by spaces.

Output: **[elements of permutation separated by spaces]** (where each element is determined by the rules provided in the initial state)
