The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the value of `t` by 2. Given the initial state, `t` is defined as `2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD`. After executing the code, `t` will be updated to `4 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD`.

The values of other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `4 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` % MOD, `i` is 1.**
