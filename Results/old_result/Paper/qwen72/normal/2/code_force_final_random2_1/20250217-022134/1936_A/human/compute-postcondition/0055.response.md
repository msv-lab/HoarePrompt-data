To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the original value of `mak`, which is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements.

Given this information, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

1. **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` will be the first element of the `pans` list.
2. **`pans[mak]`**: Again, since `mak` is 0, this will also be the first element of the `pans` list.
3. **`pans[i]`**: Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` will be the second element of the `pans` list.
4. **`pans[i]`**: Again, since `i` is 1, this will also be the second element of the `pans` list.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the following:

- The string `'?'`
- The first element of the `pans` list
- The first element of the `pans` list
- The second element of the `pans` list
- The second element of the `pans` list

Since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, let's denote the first element of `pans` as `pans[0]` and the second element of `pans` as `pans[1]`.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[1] is the second element of the pans list)**
