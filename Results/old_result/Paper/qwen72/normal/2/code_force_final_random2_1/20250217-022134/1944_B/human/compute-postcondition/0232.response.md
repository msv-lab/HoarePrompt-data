Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `len(l)` is 2. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` (which is the same as `b[0]`), and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]` and `b[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `len(l)` becomes 3 with `b[1]` appended to `l`. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
