The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 2 in this case. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`, `lex`, and `info`, as long as the range limit (2) is greater than 0. However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we focus on `j`.

For the loop to execute, `j` should start from 0, and the range limit is already set to 2, which ensures the loop will run twice.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is the input integer, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value**
