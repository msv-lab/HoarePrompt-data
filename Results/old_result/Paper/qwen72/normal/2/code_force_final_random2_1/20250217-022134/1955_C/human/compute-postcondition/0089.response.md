The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during the execution of this statement.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`, `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is now `k - a[r+1] * 2`, and `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r+1]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, 2, or 3, and `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
