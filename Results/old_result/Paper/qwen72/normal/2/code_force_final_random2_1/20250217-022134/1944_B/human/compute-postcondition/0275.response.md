Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `len(l)` is the number of unique elements in `b` (excluding the last element if it's the same as the second-to-last element). If `c[2] == c[1]`, `k` is `req - 6` and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` appended to its previous contents, the value of `c[1]` again, the value of `c[2]`, and the value of `c[2]` again, plus the value of `c[3]` and `c[3]` again. Otherwise, `k` is `req - 4` and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[1]` appended to its previous contents and the value of `c[1]` again, plus the value of `c[3]` and `c[3]` again. `ans1` contains the last element of `b` twice if `b[n-2] == b[n-1]` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found during the loop. `q`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
