Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is defined as 2.
- `v2` is defined as 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print the string `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`, separated by spaces.

Given the values:
- `v1` is 2.
- `v2` is 3.

The output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
