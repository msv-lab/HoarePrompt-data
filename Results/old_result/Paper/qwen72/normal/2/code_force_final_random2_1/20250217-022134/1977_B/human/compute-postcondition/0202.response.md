The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `-1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of `s` will be set to `-1`.

Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `i` is 1, so `s[1]` is set to `-1`.
- The value of `flag` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so it remains unchanged.
- The value of `s[0]` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains as it was initially.
- The rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a list of 30 elements where `s[1]` is now `-1`, and the rest of the elements are either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains as '0' or '1' based on the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `s[1]` remains '0'. If `flag` is 0, `s[1]` remains unchanged.**
