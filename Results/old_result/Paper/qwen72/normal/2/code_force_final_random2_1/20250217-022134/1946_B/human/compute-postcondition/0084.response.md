Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `T`, `_`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n` and `k` are updated with the values read from the next line of standard input, where `n` and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than 0.
