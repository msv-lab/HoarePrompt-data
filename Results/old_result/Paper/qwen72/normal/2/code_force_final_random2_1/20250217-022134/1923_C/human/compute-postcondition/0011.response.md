The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the list `l` for `x` to take as its value.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, and `x` is the second integer in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` will be the third integer in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input that must have at least 3 integers, `p` is a list containing the first integer from `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of the first and second integers in the list `l`, `x` is the third integer in the list `l`.**
