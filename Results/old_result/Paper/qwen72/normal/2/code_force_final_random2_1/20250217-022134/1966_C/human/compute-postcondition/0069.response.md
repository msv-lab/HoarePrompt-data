The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case involves a number of piles of stones. Specifically, the function is designed to handle:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles.
- Each pile contains an integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in the i-th pile.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can infer that the function likely returns some form of processed data or computed results based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a set of piles with a specified number of stones. It returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
