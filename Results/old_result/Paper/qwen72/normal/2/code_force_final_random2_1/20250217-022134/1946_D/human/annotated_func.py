#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, where the input is split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each split part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value entered by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_3`. This function is designed to read input from the standard input, typically used to parse input data for further processing in the program.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into an integer. The input is taken from the standard input, and the elements are expected to be numerical strings that can be converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input by spaces, and returns a map object that converts each split element into an integer. The input is expected to be a string of space-separated numerical values. After the function concludes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user's input after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns the user's input after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace. The final state of the program includes the returned string, which is the user's input with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all 30 iterations from 29 down to 0. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under the conditions specified in the loop. The list `a` may be modified based on the operations performed within the loop, particularly when `u` is 0 and `v` is even, where elements of `a` are replaced with the XOR results of certain subsets. The list `t` will be reset to an empty list after each iteration where `u` is 0 and `v` is even, and it will be used to store intermediate results. The variables `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Here, `ans` holds the maximum value found during the loop execution, which is the highest count of elements in `a` whose bit at any position (from 29 to 0) is 0, under the conditions specified in the loop. The length of `a` is the number of elements in the list `a` after all modifications within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and a non-negative integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It returns the maximum value between the length of the list `a` after processing and a computed value `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by counting the maximum number of elements in `a` whose bits at a specific position (from 29 to 0) match certain conditions. If these conditions are not met, the function may return -1. The function modifies the list `a` during its execution, but the original values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
