The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `n` must still be greater than `y`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is 3, `l` is a list of integers from the input line, `a` is the first element of `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, then `b` is set to `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
