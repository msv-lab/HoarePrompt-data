Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` is the input integer minus 27, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 1]] if the original `lex` was less than 28, or `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 27]] if the original `lex` was ≥ 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, lex - 27]] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 27]] if 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, or [[26, 26, lex - 53]] if `lex` ≥ 78. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.**
