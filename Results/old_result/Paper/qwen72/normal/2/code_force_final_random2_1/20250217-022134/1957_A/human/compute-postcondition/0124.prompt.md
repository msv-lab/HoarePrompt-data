You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The variable `w` is equal to the number of iterations the loop has completed, which is the same as the initial value of `w`. The variable `_` is now equal to `w - 1`, indicating the final iteration index. The variable `ln` is the last input integer read during the final iteration. The variable `palka` is the last list of integers read from the input during the final iteration. The variable `pl` is a list of all unique integers from the last `palka` in the order they first appeared. The variable `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the last `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the last `palka`. The variable `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in the last `pl`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
