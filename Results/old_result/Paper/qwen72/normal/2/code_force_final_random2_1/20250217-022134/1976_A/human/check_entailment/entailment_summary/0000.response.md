Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to check if a given password meets specific criteria for being considered strong. The criteria include:

1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program uses a function `func_1` to validate the password against these criteria. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function works:

- **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function first separates the digits and letters from the password into two separate lists.
- **Sorting**: Both lists are then sorted in ascending order.
- **Validation of Order**:
  - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
  - It ensures that no digit is greater than any letter in the password.
- **Reconstruction and Comparison**: The function reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters and compares this reconstructed string with the original password to ensure they match.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Digit and Letter Order Check**: The function incorrectly checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not necessary. Instead, it should ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.
2. **Redundant Sorting Check**: The function already sorts the digits and letters, so the final comparison with the original password is redundant. The function should directly check the order of digits and letters in the original password.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    has_letter = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if has_letter:
                return False  # A digit comes after a letter
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            has_letter = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False  # Digits or letters are not in non-decreasing order
    
    return True
```

Given the original implementation, the function does not correctly handle the case where a digit comes after a letter, and it performs unnecessary sorting and reconstruction.

Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
