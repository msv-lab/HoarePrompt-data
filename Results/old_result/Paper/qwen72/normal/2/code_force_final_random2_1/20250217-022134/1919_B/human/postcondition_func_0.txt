The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length` as inputs. The string `expression` consists only of the characters "+" and "-", and its length is between 1 and 5000. The function calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in the `expression` and returns this value. After the function concludes, the final state is that the function has returned an integer representing this absolute difference.
