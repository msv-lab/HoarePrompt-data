To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

### Analysis:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to 1.
- `len(permutation)` is the length of the `permutation` list, which is `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must be true. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1, this means that `len(permutation)` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is m + 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.

### Required Adjustment:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1 and `len(permutation)` is `n`, the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

Given the constraints on `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `n` is always greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is m + 1; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1**
