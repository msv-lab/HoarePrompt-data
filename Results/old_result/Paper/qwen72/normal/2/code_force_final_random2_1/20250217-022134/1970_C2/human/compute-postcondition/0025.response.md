The only objects in the loop head are the variable `key` and the dictionary `nodes`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `nodes`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key in `nodes` that hasn't been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `nodes` must contain at least one key, and the current `key` has been processed. For the loop to execute again, `nodes` must still contain at least one unprocessed key. The `key` will be updated to the next key in `nodes`.

State: **`nodes` must contain at least one unprocessed key, `key` is the next key in `nodes`**
