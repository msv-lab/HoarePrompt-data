The code snippet reassigns the value of `p` to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the new value of `p` will be calculated based on this formula. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.**
