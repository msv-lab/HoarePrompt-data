Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value (0) and `x // i`, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (0) and the integer division of `x` by `i` (`x // i`).
- Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is simply `x`.
- Therefore, `ans` is now the maximum of 0 and `x`, which is `x` because `x` is at least 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
