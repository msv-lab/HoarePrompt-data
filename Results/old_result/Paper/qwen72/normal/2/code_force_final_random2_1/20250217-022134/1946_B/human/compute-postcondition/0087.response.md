Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (k-1)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-1`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `t` and `tmp` are both set to 0.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `ans`, `i`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
