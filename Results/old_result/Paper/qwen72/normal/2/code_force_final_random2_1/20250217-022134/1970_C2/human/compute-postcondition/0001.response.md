Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of each node, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list called `edges`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, or `start`, which remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is the creation of the empty list `edges`.
