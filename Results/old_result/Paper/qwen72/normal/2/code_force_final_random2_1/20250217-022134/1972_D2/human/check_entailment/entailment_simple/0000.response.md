### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
     - It iterates over `x` while \(x \times x \le n\).
     - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` while \((x + y) \times x \le n\) and \((x + y) \times y \le m\).
     - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\).
     - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: Both functions correctly handle the input as specified.
   - **Loop Conditions**: The loops in `func_1` ensure that all possible pairs \((a, b)\) are considered within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - **GCD Condition**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is correctly checked.
   - **Count Calculation**: The count of valid pairs is correctly calculated using the minimum of the two quotients.
   - **Output**: The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
