### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` variable is set to `n` to shift the indices so that negative sums can be represented in the DP array.
   - The initial state of `dp` is set such that `dp[offset] = 1`, representing the initial prefix sum of 0.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition is correctly implemented. For each element in the array `a`, the program updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums that can be achieved by adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - The `new_dp` array is used to store the updated values, and the `dp` array is updated at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated by adding the last element of `p` to the `offset`.
   - The result is then retrieved from the `dp` array at the corresponding index.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases correctly.
   - It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs up to the constraints (`n = 5000`).
   - It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` has repeated values or negative values.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution for the given problem. The initialization, transition, and final result calculation are all handled correctly. The input handling and edge cases are also managed appropriately.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
