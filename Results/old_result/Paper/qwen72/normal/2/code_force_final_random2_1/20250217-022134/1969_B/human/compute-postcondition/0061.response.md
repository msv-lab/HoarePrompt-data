Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[0, 1]` because `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `c` is the first element in the list `s` which is 1.**
