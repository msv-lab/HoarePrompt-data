### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.
   - It sorts the list `l` to ensure that the cheapest tickets are considered first.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which is not used until inside the loop.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is indeed incorrect. This value should be 0 because it represents the total cost of purchasing tickets.

3. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to purchase `s` as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets per day) and `k` (remaining tickets needed).
   - It subtracts `s` from `k` to update the remaining tickets needed.
   - It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day, which is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the total cost `c` as an integer.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:**
  - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0 because it represents the total cost of purchasing tickets.
  - This incorrect initialization will lead to an incorrect final cost.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is also incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
  - The correct cost calculation should be `c += l[i] * s`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        print(c)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified the issues with the initialization of `c` and the cost calculation. The provided reasoning and the corrected program are correct. Therefore, the final evaluation is that the given program is incorrect.
