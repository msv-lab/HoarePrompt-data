The code snippet `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans1` initially contains the last element of `b`.
- `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` adds the last element of `b` (which is `b[n - 1]`) to `ans1`.

Therefore, the new state of `ans1` will be the original `ans1` plus the last element of `b`.

The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans2`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` will be the original `n`, `k` is now `2 * k`, `ans2` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from the input, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`), `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
