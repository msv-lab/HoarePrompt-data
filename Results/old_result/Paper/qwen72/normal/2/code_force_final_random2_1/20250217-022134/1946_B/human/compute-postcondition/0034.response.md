The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that `ans` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`.
- `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative.
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing `ans %= MOD`:
- `ans` is updated to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t` modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is 1.**
