Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of `combined` (each element being a tuple consisting of the last `k` elements of `neg_prices` and the corresponding elements from `bonuses`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `combined` was not empty, `combined` is now `k` elements shorter.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `heap` will contain the last `k` elements of the `combined` list, which are tuples of the negated prices and their corresponding bonuses.
- The `combined` list will be shortened by `k` elements, as these elements have been moved to `heap`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`) will retain their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.
