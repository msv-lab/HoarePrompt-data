Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`. `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, or if either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
