Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n` is less than `k`.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n = 0`
   - `k` is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `costs = [1 - k, 1]`
   - `h` is calculated as the sum of `n` divided by each element in `costs`. Since `n` is 0, the division results in 0 for both elements:
     \[
     h = \frac{0}{1 - k} + \frac{0}{1} = 0 + 0 = 0
     \]
   - `curr = 0`
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but from the calculation above, `h` is 0, which contradicts the condition `h >= k`. However, we will proceed with the given conditions.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*costs)
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement unpacks the `costs` list and prints its elements.
   - The `costs` list contains two elements: `1 - k` and `1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The first element of `costs` is `1 - k`.
   - The second element of `costs` is `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **1 - k, 1**
