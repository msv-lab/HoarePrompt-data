#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` will contain all characters from `s` that were present in `alphabet` before being removed, and `s2` will contain all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had exactly one element left. The set `alphabet` will either be empty or reset to the original set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, depending on whether the last character processed caused a reset.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring of `s1` starts from the position `r * k` and goes to the end of `s1`. `s2` contains all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had exactly one element left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It processes the string `s` by iterating through its characters and maintaining two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are part of a dynamically changing set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the set has more than one element, the character is removed from the set; if the set has exactly one element, the character is added to `s2` and the set is reset to the original `k` alphabets. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2` which contains characters added when the set had exactly one element left.
