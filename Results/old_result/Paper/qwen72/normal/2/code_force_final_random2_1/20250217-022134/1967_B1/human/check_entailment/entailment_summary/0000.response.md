Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `b` from 2 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n` and then adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - This formula does not correctly reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The correct approach would involve checking the condition for each pair `(a, b)` and counting the valid pairs.

2. **Logical Error:**
   - The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition. It seems to be an incorrect simplification or misunderstanding of the problem.

3. **Efficiency Concerns:**
   - The current implementation has a time complexity of \(O(t \cdot \min(n, m))\), which is inefficient for large values of `n` and `m` (up to \(2 \times 10^6\)). A more efficient approach is needed to handle the constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
