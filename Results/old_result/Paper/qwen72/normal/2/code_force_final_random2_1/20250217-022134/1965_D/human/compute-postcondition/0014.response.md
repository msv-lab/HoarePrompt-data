Output State: **`a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `prev` is the previous value of `x`, `odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must contain at least two elements, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of zeros of length `n` except for the updated value at index `idx`.**

Explanation:
- The value at index `idx` in the list `a` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The value of `idx` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The value of `x` is updated to the next element in the list `odds`.
- The value of `prev` is updated to the previous value of `x`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
