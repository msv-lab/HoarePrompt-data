To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Ensuring the Condition Holds:**
   - Since `i` is now 2, the condition `2 < n - 1` must be true.
   - This implies that `n` must be greater than 3.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must hold, so `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` (which is 3) if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0, `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the element 3, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.**
