Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. Otherwise, `length` is 30, and `s` has 30 elements. Additionally, either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
