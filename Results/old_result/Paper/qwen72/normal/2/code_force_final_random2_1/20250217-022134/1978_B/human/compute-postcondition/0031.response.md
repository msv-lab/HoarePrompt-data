The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function calculates the maximum profit (`max_profit`) by comparing different profit values (`profit_next` and `profit_mid`) during its execution. The function returns the highest profit value observed.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) and returns the maximum profit (`max_profit`) calculated by comparing `profit_next` and `profit_mid` throughout the process.**
