Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(4 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` % MOD + `t` % MOD, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` % MOD + `t` % MOD, and then it is further reduced modulo `MOD`.
