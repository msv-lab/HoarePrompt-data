Postcondition: ***`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than 2, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
