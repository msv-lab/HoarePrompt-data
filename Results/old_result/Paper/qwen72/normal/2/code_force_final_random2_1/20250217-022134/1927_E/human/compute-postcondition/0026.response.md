To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `len(permutation)` for the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `m + 2`.
- `i` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1` and `len(permutation)` is `n`, we need to check if `k + 1 < n`.

Given the constraints:
- `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
- `k` is even

Since `k` is at least 2 and `n` is at least `k`, `k + 1` will always be less than `n` as long as `k` is at least 2 and `n` is at least `k + 1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except `permutation[1]` which is now `m + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m + 2`; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`**
