To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 2, which implies `n` must be greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is `[2]`.**
