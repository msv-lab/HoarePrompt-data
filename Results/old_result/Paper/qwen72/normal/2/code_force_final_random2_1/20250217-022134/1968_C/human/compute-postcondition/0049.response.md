Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` remains the same as the input integer for each test case, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed, and `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces. The variables `line` and `T` are updated with new inputs for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.**

Explanation:
- `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` becomes 0, which causes the loop to terminate.
- For each test case, `n` is read from the input and remains the same throughout the loop for that test case.
- The variable `i` iterates from 1 to `n-1` within the inner loop, and after the inner loop completes, `i` is `n-1`.
- The list `a` starts with `[1000]` and appends `n-1` elements, each calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`. After the inner loop, `a` is reversed.
- The variable `result` is a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a`, separated by spaces.
- The variables `line` and `T` are updated with new inputs for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes because they are re-initialized in each iteration.
