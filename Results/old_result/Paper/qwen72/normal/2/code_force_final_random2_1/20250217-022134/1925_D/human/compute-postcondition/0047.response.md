The code snippet `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This operation changes the values of these variables.

Let's list the impact of the code on the program:

- `a` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `f` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `f` is the third integer from the new input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * 0 + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
