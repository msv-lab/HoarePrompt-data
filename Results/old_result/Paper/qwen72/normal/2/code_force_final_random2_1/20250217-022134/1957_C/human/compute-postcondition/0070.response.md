Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `k` is 0.
- `i` is -1.
- `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations. Specifically:
  - For each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1.
  - For each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial states.

### Analysis:
- We know that `m` is 1.
- The code snippet simply prints the value 1.

### Explanation:
- The value of `m` is given as 1.
- The `print` statement outputs the integer 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
