Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in ascending order, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.***
