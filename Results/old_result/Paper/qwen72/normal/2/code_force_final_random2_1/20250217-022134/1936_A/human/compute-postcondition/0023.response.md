Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is an empty list.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists). Since we don't have the exact value of `n` or the user inputs, we can only say that `mak` is either 0 or some integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
- `i` is 0, as given in the initial state.
- `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `?`
- The value of `mak`
- The value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`)
- The value of `i` (which is 0)
- The value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`)

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak]** (where [mak] is the value of `mak` which is either 0 or the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`).
