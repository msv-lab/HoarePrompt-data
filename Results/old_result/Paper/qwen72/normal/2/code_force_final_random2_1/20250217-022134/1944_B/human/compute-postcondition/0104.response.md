The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `i` will be `n`
- `k` will be `req - n`
- `ans2` will contain the first `min(n, req)` elements of `l`, each appended once
- `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged
- `q` is `t`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is now the first integer from the input
- `k` is now the second integer from the input

The other variables (`i`, `ans2`, `ans1`, `l`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` will be the original `n`, `k` will be the second integer from the input, `ans2` will contain the first `min(original n, req)` elements of `l`, each appended once, `n` is the first integer from the input, `ans1` and `l` remain unchanged, `q` is `t`.**
