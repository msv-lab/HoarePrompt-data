Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `t-1`; `n` is the last integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained more than one '1', `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially, an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 100.
- `i` has completed all iterations, so it is now `t-1`.
- `n` is the value of the last test case, which is the last integer input by the user.
- `j` is `n-1`, indicating the last row of the grid has been processed.
- `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained exactly one '1'.
- `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` for any test case contained more than one '1'.
- If none of the conditions for setting `a` or `b` were met, they will remain as their initial values (0 for `a` and an empty string for `b`).
