Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `palka`) is either set to 1 (if it did not exist in `d` before) or incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique integers in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the first element of `palka`.***
