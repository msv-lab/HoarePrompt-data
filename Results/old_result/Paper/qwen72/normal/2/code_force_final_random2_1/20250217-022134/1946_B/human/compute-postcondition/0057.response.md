Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0, `x` is the second element in `a`, `tmp` is the maximum of the first element in `a` and 0 plus the second element in `a` (or 0 if this sum is less than 0), `t` is now the maximum of `tmp` and the original `t`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of `tmp` and its original value.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
