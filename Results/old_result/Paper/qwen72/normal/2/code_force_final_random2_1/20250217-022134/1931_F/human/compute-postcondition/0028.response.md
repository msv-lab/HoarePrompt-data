Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
