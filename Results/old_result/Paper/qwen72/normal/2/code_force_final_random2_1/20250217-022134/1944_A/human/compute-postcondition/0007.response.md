Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, the loop will execute again if there are remaining iterations as specified by the initial `int(input()) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n` and `k` are now assigned the values read from the input, which are split and converted to integers.
- The values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user.
- The initial state of `_` being a placeholder and `t` being an integer within the range 1 to 10^3 remains unchanged.
- The condition for the loop to execute again based on the initial `int(input()) - 1` also remains unchanged.
