Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, `t` is updated to the value provided by the input, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default type list where `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` now contains `[u, u]`, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are now specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`.
- The values of `u` and `v` are now specific integers provided by the input.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
