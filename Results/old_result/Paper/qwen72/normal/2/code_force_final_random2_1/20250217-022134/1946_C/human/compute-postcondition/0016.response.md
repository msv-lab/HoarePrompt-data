Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and each list in `adj` contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. The loop has executed `n - 1` times, and `i` is `n - 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an input integer within the specified range.
- **`z`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: Must be at least 2 because the loop runs `n - 1` times, and `n - 1` must be at least 1.
- **`k`**: Remains the second integer read from the input, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`a` and `b`**: These are the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`adj`**: This is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of nodes connected to the corresponding node. After `n - 1` iterations, each node (from 1 to `n`) will have its adjacency list populated with the nodes it is connected to.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n - 2` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive).
