Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`) % MOD, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, which is reset to 0 if it becomes negative, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to `ans`.
- The initial value of `ans` was `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- After adding `t`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.
- All other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
