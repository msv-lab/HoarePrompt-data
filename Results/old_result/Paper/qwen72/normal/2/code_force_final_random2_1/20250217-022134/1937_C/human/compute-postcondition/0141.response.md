Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 2, `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Since `i` is 2, `prev` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
