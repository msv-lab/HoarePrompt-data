Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and the new value of `sums` is appended to `ans`. If `i` is 1, `ans` initially contains the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.**
