Functionality: ** The function reads inputs to construct a tree representation using a deque, where the tree is defined by `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then determines the starting position of a stone on the tree and calculates the minimum number of moves required to move the stone to one of the two leaves of the tree. Based on the parity (odd or even) of these moves, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the game's rules. **
