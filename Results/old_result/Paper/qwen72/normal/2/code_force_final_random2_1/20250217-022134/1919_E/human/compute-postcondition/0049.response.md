Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 2, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, and `new_dp[1]` is now `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to be `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1, so `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- If `j + 1` (which is 3) is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[3]` is set to `dp[2] % MOD`. This condition is still valid and remains unchanged.
