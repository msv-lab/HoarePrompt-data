The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the width of a 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function can handle up to 10^4 test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the given grid configuration. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem statement, so we cannot describe the exact return value without additional context.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It processes up to 10^4 test cases, with the total sum of `n` not exceeding 2 · 10^5, and returns a result for each test case based on the grid configuration.**
