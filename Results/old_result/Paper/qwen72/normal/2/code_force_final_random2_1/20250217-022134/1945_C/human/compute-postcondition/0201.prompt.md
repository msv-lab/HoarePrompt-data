Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`; `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `o` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists where `final` may contain `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` contains the first element of `lst` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`) and the second element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` contains the first element of `lst` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`). `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `lst` is a non-empty list with at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`. `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are lists. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` includes the third element of `lst` (`elem`). Additionally, if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the first element of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element of `lst`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element is equal to `mini`, `final` contains the first element of `lst`. `c1`, `pk`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, and `o` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
