Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, the standard output buffer has been flushed, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.***
