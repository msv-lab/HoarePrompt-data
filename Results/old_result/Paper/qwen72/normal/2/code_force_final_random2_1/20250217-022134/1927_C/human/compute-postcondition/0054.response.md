Output State: **All variables remain unchanged, but the program continues to the next line of code.** 

This means that the values of `t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, and `total_distinct` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, assuming this code is within a loop. If it's not in a loop, the `continue` statement will have no effect, and the program will proceed to the next line of code.
