Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
- The code `prices = list(func_2())` assigns the list of values returned by `func_2()` to the variable `prices`.
- Since `func_2()` returns values that are assigned to both `n` and `k`, and also to `prices`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but `prices` now contains the same values as those returned by `func_2()`.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
