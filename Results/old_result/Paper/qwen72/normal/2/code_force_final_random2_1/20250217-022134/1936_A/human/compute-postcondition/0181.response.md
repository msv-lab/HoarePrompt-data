Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list.
- The standard output buffer has been flushed.
- `s` is the user input string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.
- `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`. This means they should have the same value if the conditions are met.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- Since `mak` and `mak2` are defined similarly, they will have the same value.

### Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`)**

This means the output will include the question mark, followed by the value of `mak` twice, then the value of `i` (which is 1), and finally the value of `mak` again.
