Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` was initially set to `prime`, which is `primes[k]`.
- After executing `prime_to_i *= prime`, `prime_to_i` is now `prime * prime`, or `primes[k] * primes[k]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
