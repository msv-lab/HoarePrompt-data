Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 < n â‰¤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 2; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. `min_indices` is now `[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `min_indices` is a list containing `[1]` if the previous `res` is `<`, otherwise `[0, 1]`. However, since the code snippet sets `min_indices` to `[i]`, and `i` is 2, `min_indices` is now `[2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_index`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
