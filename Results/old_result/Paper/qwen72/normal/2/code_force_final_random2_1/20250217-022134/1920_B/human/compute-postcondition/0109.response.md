Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact new value is not specified, only that it has been incremented.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The updated value of `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.
