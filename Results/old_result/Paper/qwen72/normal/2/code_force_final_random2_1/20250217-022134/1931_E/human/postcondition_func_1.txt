The function `zerocnts` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9 and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. After the function concludes, `num` remains unchanged, and the returned value represents the count of consecutive zeros at the end of the string representation of `num`.
