Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers read from the input respectively, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, and `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to its existing list, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a` appended to its existing list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to its existing list, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a` appended to its existing list, and `adj[b]` has been updated to include `a` as the last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
