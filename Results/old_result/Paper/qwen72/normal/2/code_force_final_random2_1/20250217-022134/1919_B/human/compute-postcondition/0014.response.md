The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ length ≤ 5000. The function returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters in the string `expression`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`. It returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters in `expression`.**
