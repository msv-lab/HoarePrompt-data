Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). For each test case, `nums` is a list initially containing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). After processing each test case, `nums` is modified by removing the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists) and appending the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The final state of `nums` for each test case will reflect these changes. The loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and its contents for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and for each of the `t` test cases, the variables `n` and `k` are integers within their respective ranges. The list `nums` starts with the powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{20}\). For each test case, the list `nums` is modified by removing one element and adding three new elements based on the value of `k`. The loop prints the length of the modified list and its contents for each test case.
