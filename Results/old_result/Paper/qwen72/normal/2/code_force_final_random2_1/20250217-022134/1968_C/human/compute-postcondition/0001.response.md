The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is non-zero and the loop can execute.

State: **t is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
