Reasoning:

The program aims to solve a problem involving calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for pairs of children selected for excursions. The key aspects to verify include:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case with the specified inputs for `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as the friendship pairs and their values.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`) correctly by iterating through the `m` pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`), which is correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value is derived from the problem statement. The expression `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `2 * cn2 ** 2` is used to normalize the expected value, considering the total number of possible pairs and the number of excursions.

5. **GCD and Modular Inverse**:
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction `p / q`.
   - The modular inverse is calculated using `pow(q, -1, M)` to handle the division in modulo arithmetic.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of the modular inverse calculation, which is the required output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The steps are logically sound and follow the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
