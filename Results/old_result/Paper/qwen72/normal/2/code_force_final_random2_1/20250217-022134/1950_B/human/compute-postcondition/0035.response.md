Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `casos` must be greater than 0, and `c` is 0. If `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` also remains unchanged.***
