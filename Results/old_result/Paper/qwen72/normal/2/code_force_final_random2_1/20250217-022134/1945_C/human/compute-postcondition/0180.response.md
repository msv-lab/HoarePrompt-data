The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the element 3.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Here's the detailed output state:

- `one_perc` is still updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- `mini` is still \(10^8\).
- `zero` is still 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0.
- `one` is still 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0.
- `o` is still the count of '1' characters in `sl`.
- `c1` is still equal to `o * 100 // n`.
- `pk` is still set to `n // 2`.
- `lst` now contains the element 3.
- `final` is still a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0.
- `t` is still `t - 1`.
- `n` is still an input integer greater than 3.
- `s` is still an input string.
- `sl` is still a list of characters from `s`.
- `z` is still the count of '0' characters in `sl`.
- `i` is still 2.
- `zero_perc` is still `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
