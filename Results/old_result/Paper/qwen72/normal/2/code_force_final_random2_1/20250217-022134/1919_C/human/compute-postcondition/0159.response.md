Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is 2, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[2]`, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to the third element of the list `l` (since `y` is 2).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
