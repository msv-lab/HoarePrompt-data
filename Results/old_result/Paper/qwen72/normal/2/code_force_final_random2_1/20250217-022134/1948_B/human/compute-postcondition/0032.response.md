Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and caused `ans` to be set to False.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. This operation updates the value of `arr` to a new list of integers derived from the input. All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
