The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.
- The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

However, since the output is not specified, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Assuming the function processes these inputs and returns some result based on the test cases, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `x_2, ..., x_n`. It returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**
