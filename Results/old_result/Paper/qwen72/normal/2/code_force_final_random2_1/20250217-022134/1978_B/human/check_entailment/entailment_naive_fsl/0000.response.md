Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. The `func_1` function calculates the profit for a given \( k \), and the `func_2` function performs the binary search to find the maximum profit. The program handles all edge cases, such as when \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \), and it correctly computes the profit for various values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
