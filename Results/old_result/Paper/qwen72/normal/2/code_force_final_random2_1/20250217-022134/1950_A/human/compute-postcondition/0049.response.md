To determine what will be printed by the `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
   - `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
   - `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` < `y`, then:
     - If `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'.
     - If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'.
     - If `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'.
   - If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces.

Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their exact values cannot be determined beforehand. However, the print statement will output these values directly.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9 inclusive)**
