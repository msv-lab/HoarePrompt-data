### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to use these queries to identify the indices with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) in \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - Once \( \text{mak} \) is identified, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mak2} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \oplus p_{\text{mak2}} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{\text{mak}} \) with each \( p_i \) again, but this time it keeps track of indices that have the same value as \( p_{\text{mak}} \) (i.e., \( p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_i = p_{\text{mak}} \)).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After identifying potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \), the program compares the XOR values of these candidates to find the maximum.
   - It prints the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and the candidate with the maximum XOR value.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( \text{mak} \).
   - It then makes \( n \) queries to find potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \).
   - Finally, it makes up to \( \text{len(pans)} - 1 \) queries to find the maximum XOR value among the candidates.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)} - 1) \leq 3n \), which satisfies the constraint.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will directly compare the two elements and output the result.
   - For larger \( n \), the program ensures that it finds the maximum XOR value efficiently within the query limit.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, while adhering to the query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
