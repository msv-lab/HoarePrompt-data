To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the condition that controls the loop's continuation, `i < k + 1`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `_` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0 (unchanged).
- `x` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a` (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 or not 0.
- If `i` is 0:
  - `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.
  - `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not 0:
  - `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`.
  - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `_` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0 (unchanged).
- `x` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a` (unchanged).
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is 1:
  - `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.
  - `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not 1:
  - `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`.
  - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, if `i` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`**.
