The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the problem statement. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

- The function should accept two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and a list of lists `cases` (where each inner list contains 2n integers).
- For each test case, the function processes the list of 2n integers and returns a result based on the processing logic.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- Each test case contains a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function should return a result for each test case. Assuming the function returns a list of results, one for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `cases` (a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers). It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
