The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `odds`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `odds`. If there are more elements in `odds`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in `odds`, and `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `odds` must have at least one more element.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` will be the next (subsequent) element in `odds`.
- `odds` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

State: **`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`, `odds` must have at least one more element**
