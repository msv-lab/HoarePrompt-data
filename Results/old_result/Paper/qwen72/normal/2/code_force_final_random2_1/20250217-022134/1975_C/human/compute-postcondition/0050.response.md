The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the given context, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, and `a` itself, which is a list of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes up to `t` test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the total sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function's output is not specified, but typically such functions would return or print results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It handles up to 500 test cases, with the total number of elements across all lists not exceeding 10^5. The specific output for each test case is not defined, but the function is expected to process each test case according to the given constraints.**
