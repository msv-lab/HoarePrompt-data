You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings to be formed, and `k` is an integer representing the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used. Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676), where each test case provides a pair of `n` and `k`.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string composed of the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times. The string 's' is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', and the returned string is a substring of 's' from the start up to the `k`-th character, repeated `n` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one can be returned.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

4. **String Construction**: The program constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times. This approach ensures that the resulting string `s` will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters.

5. **Validation**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `"ab"`, which contains both "a" and "b" as subsequences.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `s` is `"aa"`, which contains "aa" as a subsequence.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `"aabb"`, which contains "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb" as subsequences.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` is `"aabbcc"`, which contains "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", and "cc" as subsequences.

6. **Efficiency and Correctness**:
   - The approach of repeating the first `k` characters `n` times ensures that the resulting string `s` is minimal in length while covering all required subsequences.
   - The program does not use unnecessary imports or complex logic, making it efficient and straightforward.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and generates the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
