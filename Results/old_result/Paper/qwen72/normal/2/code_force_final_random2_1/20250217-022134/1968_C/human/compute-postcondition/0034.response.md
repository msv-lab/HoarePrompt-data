Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` contains `n` elements where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, but now `a` is reversed, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is a truthy value decreased by 1, and the other variables (`line`, `T`) remain unchanged.**
