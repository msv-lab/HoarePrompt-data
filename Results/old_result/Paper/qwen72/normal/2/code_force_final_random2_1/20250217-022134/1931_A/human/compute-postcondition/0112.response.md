Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.
- All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `info`) remain unchanged.
- The specific conditions for updating `arr` and `lex` are not affected by the given code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
