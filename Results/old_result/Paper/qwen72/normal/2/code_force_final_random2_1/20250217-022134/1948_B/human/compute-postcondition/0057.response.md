Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent check `nums != sorted(nums)` were met during any iteration. If `ans` is False, the loop broke early due to the unsorted `nums` condition; otherwise, the loop completed all iterations with `ans` remaining True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `0` because the loop decrements `i` until it reaches `1` and then stops.
- The value of `ans` will be determined by the conditions inside the loop. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` will be set to `False` and the loop will break. If no such condition is met, `ans` will remain `True`.
- The other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.
