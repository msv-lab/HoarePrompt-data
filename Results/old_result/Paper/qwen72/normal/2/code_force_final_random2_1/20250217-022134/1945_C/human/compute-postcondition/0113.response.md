The code snippet updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Given that `ele` is the first element in `lst`, and `lst` contains at least one element, the calculation will proceed without issues.

- `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the absolute value of the difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- `lst` still contains at least one element.
- `ele` remains the first element in `lst`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst`; `lst` contains at least one element; `ele` is the first element in `lst`.**
