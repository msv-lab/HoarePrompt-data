Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the approach used to construct the sequence `nums` may fail to meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, while ensuring that for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5 3
```

### Expected Output:
A sequence of size at most 25 such that:
- There is no subsequence with a sum of 3.
- For all \(1 \le v \le 5\) where \(v \ne 3\), there is a subsequence with a sum of \(v\).

### Program's Output:
```
25
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2 4 6
```

### Analysis:
- The sequence generated by the program includes the number 2 and 1, which can form a subsequence with a sum of 3 (i.e., [2, 1]).
- This violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of 3.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for this input, making it incorrect.
