Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array (with a length between 3 and 1000). It calculates all possible cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting from each index to the end of the list, and returns a sorted list `cts` containing these cumulative sums. The original list `a` remains unchanged. **
