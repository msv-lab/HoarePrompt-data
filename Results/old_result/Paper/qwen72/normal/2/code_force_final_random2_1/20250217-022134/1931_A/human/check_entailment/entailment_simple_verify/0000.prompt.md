You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine the values of the three letters is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to construct the word by subtracting 26 or 1 from the total sum, but it does not always ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. For example, consider the input `n = 48`. The correct lexicographically smallest word is `auz` (1 + 21 + 26), but the program might produce a different result.

2. **Flawed Logic for Constructing the Word**: The program uses a fixed approach to subtract 26 or 1 from the total sum, which does not always lead to the correct lexicographically smallest word. For instance, for `n = 55`, the correct word is `czz` (3 + 26 + 26), but the program might produce a different result due to its flawed logic.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, for `n = 3`, the correct word is `aaa` (1 + 1 + 1), but the program might produce an incorrect result due to its fixed subtraction logic.

To illustrate, let's consider the input `n = 48`:
- The correct lexicographically smallest word is `auz` (1 + 21 + 26).
- The program might produce a different result, such as `azz` (1 + 26 + 21), which is not the lexicographically smallest word.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for every possible input.
