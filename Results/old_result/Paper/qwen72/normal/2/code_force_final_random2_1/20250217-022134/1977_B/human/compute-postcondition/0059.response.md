Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). The elements of `s` will have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, any consecutive '1's in `s` will have been replaced with '-1' and the subsequent bit set to '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is set will have been changed to '1'. The final value of `flag` will depend on the last operation performed in the loop. Additionally, either `flag` is not set, or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
