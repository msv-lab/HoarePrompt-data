To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head. The loop head specifies `i` starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 0 (but not including 0). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and their values are updated to those returned by `func_3()`.
- `v` is 1.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `v` is 1**
