Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` is 0, and if `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which means any buffered data is written to the output stream immediately. This does not affect the values of the variables in the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
