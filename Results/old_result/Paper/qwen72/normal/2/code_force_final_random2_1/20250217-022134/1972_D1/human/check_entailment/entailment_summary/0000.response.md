Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The inner loop starts from 4 instead of 1, which means it skips the first three possible values for \(b\). This will lead to missing valid pairs where \(b\) is 1, 2, or 3.
2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate `x` is not derived correctly from the problem statement. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Subtraction of 1**: The final result `suma - 1` is not justified based on the problem statement. There is no clear reason why 1 should be subtracted from the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
