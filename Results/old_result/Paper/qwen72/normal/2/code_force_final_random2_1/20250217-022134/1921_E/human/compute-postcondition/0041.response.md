The value of `y1` is incremented by `a`. Given that `a` is defined as `r[1] - r[5]`, which translates to `m - y2` (since `m` is `r[1]` and `y2` is `r[5]`), the new value of `y1` is `y1 + (m - y2)`.

All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 ≥ 1`, `x2 ≤ n`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, and `y1` is now `y1 + (m - y2)`.**
