Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`m` is at least 3, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates). If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` contains `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` contains `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1 == idx2`, `l` is a reference to `l1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; otherwise, `l` is a reference to `l2`, which contains `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, and `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the input, `m` is greater than 2, `val` is updated to include the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new input, `m` is greater than 3, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous value, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the new input, `m` is greater than 3, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous value, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
