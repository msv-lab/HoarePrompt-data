Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0, r is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first element of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'L', or the last element of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the appropriate elements based on the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first two elements of `a`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last two elements of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2`. If the second character of `s` is 'L', `r` remains unchanged. If the second character of `s` is 'R', `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first two elements of `a` and now includes `a[2]`, `l` is 3, and `r` is `n - 1` if the second character of `s` is 'L' or `n - 2` if the second character of `s` is 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last two elements of `a` and now includes `a[r]`, `l` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'R' or 2 if the first character of `s` is 'L', and `r` is `n - 3` if the second character of `s` is 'R' or `n - 2` if the second character of `s` is 'L'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
