Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` has three elements: `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1] - T[1]`, and `a[2] - T[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a` with the value `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `a[2] - T[2]`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` has two elements: `a[0] - T[0]` and `a[1] - T[1]`.
- After appending, `a` now has three elements: `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1] - T[1]`, and `a[2] - T[2]`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
