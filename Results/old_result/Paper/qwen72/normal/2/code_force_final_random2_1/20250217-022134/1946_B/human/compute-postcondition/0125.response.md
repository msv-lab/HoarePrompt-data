Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of an array a, and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of operations. The array a contains n integers (each between -10^9 and 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns the result of the operations performed on the array a for each test case. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
