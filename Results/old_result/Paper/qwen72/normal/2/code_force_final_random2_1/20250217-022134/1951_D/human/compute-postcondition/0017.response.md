Output State: **`n` is now `n - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is 1, and `curr` is updated to `n // i`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `curr` is already `n // i`.
- The code snippet `curr = n // i` does not change the value of `curr` because it is already set to `n // i`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the explicit note that `curr` is still `n // i`.
