Output State: **All variables retain their initial values, and the program continues to the next line of code.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop context is provided, the statement itself does not change any variable values. Therefore, all variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, and `total_distinct`) remain unchanged. The program simply moves to the next line of code, which is not shown here.
