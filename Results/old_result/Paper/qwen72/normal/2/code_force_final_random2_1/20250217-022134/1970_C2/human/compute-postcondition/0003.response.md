Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input, `nodes` is now a defaultdict with default type list, `start` is an integer where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, representing the starting node for the game, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `nodes` will automatically create an empty list for any key that does not already exist when accessed. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
