The function `func_1()` is called, but there is no information about what `func_1()` does. Without knowing the implementation of `func_1()`, we cannot determine its impact on the program state. However, since no changes to variables are specified, we assume that the function does not modify any global variables or return any values.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and it is set to the integer value provided by the user input, `_` is a placeholder and does not need initialization.**
