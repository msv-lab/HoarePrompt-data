Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- `mak` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 and the state of the output buffer remain valid.
