Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`.** 

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, `c[i]` is `c[3]`. The condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is not checked here, so `k` remains unchanged. The rest of the initial state remains valid. Therefore, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`.
