Output State: **`prev` is now the previous value of `x`, `x` is the next element in `odds`, `idx` is now `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2`, `odds` must have at least one more element.**

Explanation:
- `prev` remains the previous value of `x`.
- `x` is the next element in `odds`.
- `idx` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`.
- `a[idx]` is updated to the value of `(x - prev) // 2`.
- The condition that `odds` must have at least one more element remains unchanged.
