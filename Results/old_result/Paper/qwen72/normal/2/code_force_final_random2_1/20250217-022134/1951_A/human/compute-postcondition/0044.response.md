Output State: **`results` is a list containing strings ('yes' or 'no') for each iteration of the loop, and `r` is the last string in the list. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values, and `arr` is the last input string processed in the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `results` will contain a string ('yes' or 'no') for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions checked within the loop.
- The variable `r` will hold the last string in the `results` list, which is the result of the final iteration.
- The variables `t`, `i`, and `n` will retain their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `arr` will be the last input string that was processed during the loop's execution.
