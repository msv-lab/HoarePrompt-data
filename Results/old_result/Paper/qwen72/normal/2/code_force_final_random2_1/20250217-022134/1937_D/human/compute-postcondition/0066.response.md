The code snippet `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]` calculates the value of `zeroInd` by multiplying the last element of the list `suffZero` by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>'.
- The last element of `suffZero` is either 0 or `i + 1`.

If the last element of `suffZero` is 0:
- `zeroInd` will be `2 * 0 = 0`.

If the last element of `suffZero` is `i + 1`:
- `zeroInd` will be `2 * (i + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (decreased by 1 if `el` is '>'), `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0 (missing its last element if `el` is '>'), `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and may contain an additional element `i + 1` if `el` is not '>', `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 (with specific updates based on the conditions), `i` is `k - 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either 0 or 2 * (i + 1).**
