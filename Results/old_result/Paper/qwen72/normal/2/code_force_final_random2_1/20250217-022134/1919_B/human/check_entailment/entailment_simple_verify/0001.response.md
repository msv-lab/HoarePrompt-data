Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It calculates the difference between the number of '-' characters (`sub`) and the number of '+' characters (`count`).
   - The program returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

3. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - To minimize the total penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, or as close to equal as possible.

4. **Program's Output:**
   - The program's output, `abs(sub - count)`, does not directly correspond to the minimum possible penalty.
   - The program does not consider the optimal splitting of the array into subarrays, which is crucial for minimizing the total penalty.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
   - The program, however, returns `0` because the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, but this is coincidental and does not guarantee the correct solution for all cases.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.

Final: **False**
