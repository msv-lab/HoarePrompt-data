Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1.
- No other variables are affected by this initialization.
- The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of `idx1` and `idx2` being set to -1.
