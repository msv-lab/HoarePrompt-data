Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels using her \( n \) coins. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Initial Check for Equality**:
   - If \( n \) equals \( k \), the program prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each, and she will have exactly \( n \) coins.
   - This part is logically sound and handles the edge case correctly.

2. **Check if \( n \) is Less Than \( k \)**:
   - If \( n \) is less than \( k \), the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - This part is also logically sound.

3. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - If \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \), the program attempts to set up stalls with specific prices.
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels Alice can buy.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `h` is less than \( k \). If so, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to \( k \), it prints "2", "YES", and the two elements of `costs`.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The initialization of `costs` with `n - k + 1` and `1` is incorrect. Specifically, `n - k + 1` should be `n // k + 1` to ensure that the first stall's price is high enough to limit the number of jewels Alice can buy.
- The logic for calculating `h` and updating `n` is also flawed. The current implementation does not correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

To fix this, the correct approach would be:
- Set the first stall's price to \( n // k + 1 \) to ensure Alice buys at most \( k \) jewels.
- Set the second stall's price to 1 to ensure Alice buys the remaining jewels.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    if k == 1:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
        return
    if k > 60:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(k)
    print(' '.join(str(n // k + 1) for _ in range(k)))
```

Given the original program, the logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the setup of stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

Correctness: **False**
