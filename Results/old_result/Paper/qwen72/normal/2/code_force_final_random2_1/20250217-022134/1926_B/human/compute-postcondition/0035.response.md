The code snippet `b = ''` reassigns the variable `b` to an empty string. Since `b` was already an empty string according to the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`; `a` is 0; `b` is an empty string.**
