To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `k` is 0.
- `i` is `k - 1` (which means `i` is -1).
- `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(3, m + 1)` is non-empty.
- For the range to be non-empty, `m + 1` must be greater than 3, which means `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop index, and it will start from 3 and go up to `m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `i` is irrelevant because it will be set by the loop itself.

### Final State:
- `dp` remains as a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.
- `k` remains 0.
- `i` will be set by the loop to start from 3.
- `num` remains the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `c` and `r` remain unchanged.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.

### Final State:
State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `k` is 0, `i` is 3, `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
