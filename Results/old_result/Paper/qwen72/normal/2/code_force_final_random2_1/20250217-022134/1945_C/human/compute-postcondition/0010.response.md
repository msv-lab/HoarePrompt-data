The code snippet `o = sl.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the list `sl` and assigns this count to the variable `o`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`.**
