Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` has iterated through all keys in `hmp`, `ans` is 0, `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in p:
    if i not in hmp:
        ans += m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'A', `ans` is 0, and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user. If 'A' is not present in the Counter object `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'B', and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user. If 'B' is not present in the Counter object `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C', and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user. If 'C' is not present in the Counter object `hmp`, then `ans` is `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
