Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `flag` is False, and `count` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `count` is updated to 2. If `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `j` is updated to 1 and `flag` is set to True. If `s[j]` (which is `s[1]`) is not equal to `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[2]`), `count` is updated to 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `j` is updated to 2 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
