To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers from the current test case.
   - `freq` is a dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Given the initial state, the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` depend on the specific values of `a`, `x`, and `y` for the current test case. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them in terms of the given formulas.

**Output:**
**Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where num is the next element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
