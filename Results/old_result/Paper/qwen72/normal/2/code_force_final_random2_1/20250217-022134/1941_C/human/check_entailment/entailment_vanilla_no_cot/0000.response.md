Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only handles specific cases of the substrings "map" and "pie" and does not account for overlapping occurrences correctly. Additionally, the special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is unnecessary and incorrect, as it does not generalize well for other cases.

Here is a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. Identify all possible positions where the substrings "map" and "pie" can occur.
2. Use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to minimize the number of deletions required to remove these substrings.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))

def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    # Initialize the result with the length of the string
    result = len(s)
    
    # Check for "map"
    map_positions = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 2:
        if s[i:i+3] == "map":
            map_positions.append(i)
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    
    # Check for "pie"
    pie_positions = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 2:
        if s[i:i+3] == "pie":
            pie_positions.append(i)
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    
    # Combine positions and sort them
    positions = sorted(map_positions + pie_positions)
    
    # Calculate the minimum deletions
    deletions = 0
    last_deleted = -1
    for pos in positions:
        if pos > last_deleted:
            deletions += 1
            last_deleted = pos + 2
    
    return deletions
```

This approach ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are considered, and the minimum number of deletions is calculated correctly.
