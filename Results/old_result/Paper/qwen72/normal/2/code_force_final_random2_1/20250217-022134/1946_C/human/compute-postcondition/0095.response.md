The code `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj[a]` by appending the integer `b` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `adj[a]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements.**
