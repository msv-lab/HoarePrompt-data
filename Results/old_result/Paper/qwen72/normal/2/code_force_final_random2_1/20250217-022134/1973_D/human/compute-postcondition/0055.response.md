Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, the new value of `l` is also less than `n + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
