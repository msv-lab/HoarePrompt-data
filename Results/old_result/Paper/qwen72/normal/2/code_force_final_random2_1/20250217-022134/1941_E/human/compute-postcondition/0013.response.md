The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. Here, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The parameter `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.

The function returns a value based on the given parameters and the structure of the `rows` list. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, so I will describe the general functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. It processes the `rows` list, which represents a grid of river cell depths, and returns a result based on the given parameters and the structure of the grid.**
