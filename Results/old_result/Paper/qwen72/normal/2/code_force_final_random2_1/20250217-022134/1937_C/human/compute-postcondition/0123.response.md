Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `I` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `R` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is the new user input.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `v1`:**
   - The value of `v1` depends on the user input `r`.
   - If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `v1` remains 1.

4. **Determine the Value of `v2`:**
   - `v2` is explicitly defined as 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, so the output will be `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `r` is anything other than '<', then `v1` is 1, so the output will be `? 1 1 3 3`.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 3 3 (where v1 is 2 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1)**
