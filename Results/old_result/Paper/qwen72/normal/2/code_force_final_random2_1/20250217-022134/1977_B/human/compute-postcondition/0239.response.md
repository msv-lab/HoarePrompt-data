Output State: **`i` is 3, `length` is greater than 3, `s[2]` is '-1', `s[3]` is '0', `flag` is 0, `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `s` at index `i - 1`, which is `2`, to be '-1'. The previous value of `s[3]` was set to '0', and this remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `length`, `flag`, `x`, `t`, and `nalla` are not affected by the code.
