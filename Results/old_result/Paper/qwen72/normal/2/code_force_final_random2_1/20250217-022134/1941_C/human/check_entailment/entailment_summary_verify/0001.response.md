### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The function `func_1` should return the minimum number of deletions required.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of deletions.
   - It includes a special case where if the string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. This is a specific optimization but not necessary for the general solution.
   - It uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` for each removal.
   - Similarly, it uses another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of deletions.

3. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case where the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 is unnecessary and potentially misleading. This special case does not generalize well and could lead to incorrect results for other similar strings. For example, if the string is "mapiepie", the function would incorrectly return 1 instead of 2.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "pie" or "map") by returning 0.
   - It also handles cases where multiple occurrences of "pie" or "map" are present by repeatedly finding and removing them.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function uses a while loop to find and remove substrings, which is efficient enough given the constraints (sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\)).

6. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the function:
     - For "mmapnapie", it removes "map" and "pie" once each, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - For "azabazapi", it does not need any deletions.
     - For "mappppie", it removes "map" and "pie" once each, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - For "mapmapmapmapmapmap", it removes "map" six times, resulting in 6 deletions.
     - For "p", it does not need any deletions.
     - For "pppiepieeee", it removes "pie" twice, resulting in 2 deletions.

7. **Special Case Issue:**
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is problematic because it only handles one specific string and does not account for variations like "mapiepie" or "mapmapie". This special case should be removed to ensure the function works correctly for all inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is mostly correct but contains a special case that is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. Removing this special case will make the function more robust and correct for all inputs.

Final: **False**
