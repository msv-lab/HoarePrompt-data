Reasoning:  
The provided solution has a logical flaw. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the array and prints this count. This does not solve the problem correctly because:

1. **Counting Median Occurrences**: Counting the occurrences of the current median does not help in determining the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. The correct approach involves identifying the smallest number greater than the current median and calculating the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next higher number.

2. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
   - Sort the array.
   - Identify the current median.
   - Find the smallest number greater than the current median.
   - Calculate the number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next higher number.

Given the current implementation, it does not perform these steps and instead outputs the count of the current median, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
