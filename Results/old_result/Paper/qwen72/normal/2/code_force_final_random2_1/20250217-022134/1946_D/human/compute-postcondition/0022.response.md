The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation on the program state:

- `ai` is updated to the result of `ai ^ val`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element.
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, otherwise `t` is a list containing the value `ai`.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- The bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged.

After executing `ai ^= val`:
- `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `t` is an empty list if `op` is 1, otherwise `t` is a list containing the value `ai`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, `v` is even, `op` is now `op ^ (val >> 29 & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`.**
