The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial conditions, `arr` is initially defined based on the value of `lex`. However, the specific initial value of `arr` is not explicitly stated, but we know that it could be `[1]`, `[26]`, or `[]` depending on the value of `lex`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer

After executing `arr.append(26)`, the value 26 is added to the list `arr`. The new state of `arr` will be:
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes [1, 26]
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26]
- If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` becomes [26, 26]
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` becomes [26]

The values of `n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is updated as per the initial conditions, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and [26] if `lex` > 78.**
