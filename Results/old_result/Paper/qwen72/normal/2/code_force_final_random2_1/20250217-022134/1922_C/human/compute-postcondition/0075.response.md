To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`.
   - Remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Set to the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `u` is now `u - 3` and must evaluate to a truthy value.

4. **New values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Returned by `r()`.
   - If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c < d`. Otherwise, `c >= d`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` starts with `-1000000000.0` and ends with `2000000000.0`.
   - The values of `c` and `d` are inserted between these two values.

2. **List `b`**:
   - The list `b` grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.
   - Since `n` is the length of `a`, and `a` has at least 3 elements (`-1000000000.0`, `c`, `d`, and `2000000000.0`), `b` will grow by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - These variables are set to the values returned by `r()`.
   - `u` is then decremented by 3 and must be truthy, meaning `u - 3 > 0` or `u > 3`.

4. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is either `c < d` or `c >= d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Indices in List `b`**:
   - The indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are used to access elements in `b`.
   - Since `b` grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must be within the bounds of `b`.

2. **Values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`**:
   - The exact values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` depend on the specific values of `c` and `d` and the contents of `b`.

3. **Result of the Subtraction**:
   - The result of `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be the difference between the elements at these indices.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` and the contents of `b` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the new values returned by r(), and b is a list that has grown by 2 * (n - 3) elements)**
