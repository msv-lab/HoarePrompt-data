The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation:

1. **Identify the value of `1 << idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists.
   - `1 << idx` is equivalent to `2^idx`.

2. **Check the initial state:**
   - `nums` contains the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]`.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Determine the value of `1 << idx`:**
   - Since `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, `1 << idx` will be one of the powers of 2 in the list.

4. **Remove the element from `nums`:**
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

5. **Update the state:**
   - The list `nums` is updated by removing the element `1 << idx`.
   - All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.**
