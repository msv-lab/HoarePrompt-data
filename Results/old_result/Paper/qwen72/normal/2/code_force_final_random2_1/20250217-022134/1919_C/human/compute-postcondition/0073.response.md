The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop runs a specific number of times based on user input. Since the loop is controlled by the range function, which depends on the input, the state of `_` itself does not need to be adjusted; it simply iterates from 0 up to the number specified by the input minus one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again if there are still iterations left based on the input provided to the `range` function. The state of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop's ability to execute again. However, since the loop is iterating over a fixed range, the only relevant state to consider is the remaining number of iterations.

Since the loop is driven by the input, and assuming the loop has not completed all its iterations, the state of `_` will increment by 1 for the next iteration. However, the exact value of `_` is not explicitly tracked in the given state, so we focus on the fact that the loop will continue to the next iteration as long as the current iteration is less than the total number of iterations specified by the input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the objects in the loop head, would be:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, `n`) remain unchanged**
