Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` ≤ 78, `lex` is updated as follows: if `lex` < 28, `lex` is reduced by 1 and `arr` is [1, 26]; if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` is [26, 26]; if `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is [26] if `lex` > 78, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26]. If `lex` > 78, `arr` is an empty list and `lex` remains unchanged.***
