Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Variables and Their Values:
1. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 3.
2. **`n`**: This is greater than 0, but the exact value is not specified.
3. **`k`**: This is determined by the condition `n // k + 1 >= 3`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `k` must be a positive integer that satisfies this condition.
4. **`cnt`**: This is `k - 1`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` will also be a non-negative integer.
5. **`l`**: This is `func_2() + 1`. The value of `func_2()` is not specified, so `l` will be `func_2() + 1`.
6. **Condition**: Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. This ensures that the condition is always true given the constraints.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- **`l`**: This is `func_2() + 1`. Since the exact value of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`.
- **`i * v`**: Here, `i` is 3, but `v` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i * v`.

### Output:
Given the information, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships:

Output: **? [l] [i * v] (where l is func_2() + 1 and i * v is 3 times the value of v)**
