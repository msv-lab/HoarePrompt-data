Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same within a test case, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 1`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last input integers read, `no` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is outside the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` inclusive, then `i` remains unchanged. If `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` inclusive, `i` remains unchanged.***
