Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, and if `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4`, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k < a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` equals `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
