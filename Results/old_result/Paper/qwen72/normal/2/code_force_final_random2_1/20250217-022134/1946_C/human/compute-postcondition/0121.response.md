Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 25001.**

Explanation: The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`. Since the initial state already specifies that `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, no changes occur to the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
