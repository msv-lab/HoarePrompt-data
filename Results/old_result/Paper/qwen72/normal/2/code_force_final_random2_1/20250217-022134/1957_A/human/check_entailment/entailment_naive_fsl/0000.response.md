Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the construction of polygons with sides other than 4 (quadrilaterals). According to the problem description, the goal is to construct the maximum number of regular polygons, which can include triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), etc. However, the function `func_1` only divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which means it only counts the number of squares that can be formed. This approach fails to consider other possible regular polygons, leading to incorrect results for inputs where polygons with a different number of sides could be constructed.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be 2, as you can form two equilateral triangles (each with 3 sides of length 2). However, the given program will output 1, as it only considers forming squares.
