The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` from the iterable `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters left in the `password` string, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed character in the `password` string, and based on its type, either `digits` or `letters` lists were updated accordingly. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the `password` string to process, and this character will become the new `char`.

Therefore, for the next iteration:
- The `char` will be the next character in the `password` string.
- The conditions about `digits` and `letters` lists remain as they are until the next character is processed.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the next character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the previous `char` and the new `char`, and `letters` remains an empty list. If the next character `char` is not a digit, `digits` remains a list containing the previous `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the new `char`.**
