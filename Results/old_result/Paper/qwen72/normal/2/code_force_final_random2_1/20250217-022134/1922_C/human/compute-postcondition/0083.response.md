To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - These variables are derived from the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the `zip` function must produce at least one tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.
   - This means that the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]` must all have at least one element in common.

3. **Analyze the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` starts with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new final values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ends with `2000000000.0`.
   - To ensure that `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]` have at least one element in common, `a` must have at least 4 elements.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The list `a` must have at least 4 elements.
   - The first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`.
   - The third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`.
   - The fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`.

### Adjusted State:
- The list `a` must have at least 4 elements.
- The first element of `a` is `-1000000000.0`.
- The second element of `a` is the new value of `c` returned by `r()`.
- The third element of `a` is the new value of `d` returned by `r()`.
- The fourth element of `a` is `2000000000.0`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list with at least 4 elements starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`**.
