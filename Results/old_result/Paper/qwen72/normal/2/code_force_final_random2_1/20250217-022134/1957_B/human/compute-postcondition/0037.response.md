Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or any other variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet:

```python
l1 = input().split()
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Splitting**: The input is split into a list `l1` where each element is a string.
2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `l1` is now a list of strings.
- `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively.

### Calculation:
- No further changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `k` in this snippet.
- The variables `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` are not initialized or modified in this snippet.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of strings.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**
