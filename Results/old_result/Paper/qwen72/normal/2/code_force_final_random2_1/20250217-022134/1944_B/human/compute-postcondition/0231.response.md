Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `len(l)` is 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `len(l)` becomes 3 with `b[i]` appended to `l`. `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
