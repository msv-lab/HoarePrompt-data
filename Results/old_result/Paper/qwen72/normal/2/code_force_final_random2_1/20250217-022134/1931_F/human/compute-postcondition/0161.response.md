Postcondition: **`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is `a2`. Additionally, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**
