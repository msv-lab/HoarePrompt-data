Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the function:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters and array for a test case).

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `results` to store the results of each test case, and `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

3. **Loop Through Array**: For each number in the array `a`, it calculates:
   - `mod_x`: The remainder when the number is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: The remainder when the number is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: The required remainder such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: The required remainder such that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Count Beautiful Pairs**: It checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `beautiful_count`.

5. **Update Frequency Dictionary**: It updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

6. **Store Result**: After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

7. **Return Results**: Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:
- **Modulo Calculations**: The modulo calculations are correct and align with the problem statement.
- **Pair Checking**: The logic for checking and updating the frequency dictionary is correct and ensures that the pairs are counted accurately.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as small arrays and large values of `x` and `y` correctly.
- **Output**: The function outputs the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
