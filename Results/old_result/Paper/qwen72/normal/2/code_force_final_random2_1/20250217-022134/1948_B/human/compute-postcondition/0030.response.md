The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will increment by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and caused `ans` to be set to False.**
