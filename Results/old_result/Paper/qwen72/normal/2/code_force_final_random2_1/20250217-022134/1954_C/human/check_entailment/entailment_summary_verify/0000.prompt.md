You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes two input strings, `a` and `b`, which represent large integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It ensures that no character in `a` is less than the corresponding character in `b` by swapping them if necessary. After processing, it prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the input strings according to the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always maximize the product of \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, the logic in the program only swaps digits once when it finds a pair where \(a[i] < b[i]\), and then it continues to swap digits if \(a[i] > b[i]\). This approach does not guarantee that the final values of \(x\) and \(y\) will yield the maximum possible product.

Counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  34
  43
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  44
  33
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  43
  34
  ```

In this case, the program only swaps the first pair of digits where \(a[0] < b[0]\), resulting in \(a = 43\) and \(b = 34\). However, the maximum product is achieved by swapping both pairs of digits, resulting in \(a = 44\) and \(b = 33\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
