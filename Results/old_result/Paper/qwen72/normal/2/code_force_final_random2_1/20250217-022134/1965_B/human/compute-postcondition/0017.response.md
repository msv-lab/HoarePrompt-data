Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of the first number in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such number exists.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `idx` will hold the index of the largest number in the `nums` list that is less than or equal to `k`. If no number in the `nums` list is less than or equal to `k`, `idx` will remain -1. The variable `i` will hold the index of the first number in the `nums` list that is greater than `k`, or it will be the length of the `nums` list if no such number exists. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
