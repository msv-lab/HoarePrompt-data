Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the product of the elements being removed, but it does not calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array before each removal, which is what the problem requires. Instead, it appends the elements being removed to a list `b` and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not match the requirement to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array before each removal.

To fix this, the program should maintain the product of the current elements in the array and update this product appropriately after each removal. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for ai in a:
        product = (product * ai) % m
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This version correctly maintains the product of the current elements in the array and updates it using modular arithmetic to handle the removals. The `pow(a[l], m-2, m)` and `pow(a[r], m-2, m)` calls compute the modular inverse of the element being removed, which is necessary to "undo" its contribution to the product.
