Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed

Given that `a` is a list with no elements remaining to be processed, it means that `a` is an empty list (`[]`). Therefore, `len(a)` is 0, and `i` is `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.

However, the `print()` statement does not contain any arguments. When `print()` is called without any arguments, it simply prints a newline character.

Output: **(an empty line)**
