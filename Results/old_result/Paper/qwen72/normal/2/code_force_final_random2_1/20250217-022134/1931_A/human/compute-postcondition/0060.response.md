Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]], `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an integer where 28 ≤ lex ≤ 78. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `info` is updated to [[26, 26, lex - 78]], `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an integer where 2 ≤ lex ≤ 52.***
