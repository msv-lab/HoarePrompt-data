### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes dictionaries for `players` and `goals`, and a dictionary for movement directions `mouvements`.
   - It parses the initial state of the field, correctly identifying players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles movements (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) by updating the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the player's position based on the direction.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal when they throw the Quaffle.
   - It correctly increments the score for the appropriate team based on the goal type and prints the scoring event with the correct timestamp.
   - However, the program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored, which is a requirement according to the problem statement.

4. **Final Score Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the final score after all moves have been processed.

5. **Missing Functionality**:
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's reset to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program does not handle the catching of the Quaffle by a player, which is part of the problem description.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is correctly defined and works as intended. It takes the current position of a player and a movement direction, and returns the new position after applying the movement.
- The function `func_1` is used correctly in the program to update the player's position.

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the missing functionalities:
  - **Quaffle Reset**: The program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
  - **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the catching of the Quaffle by a player.

### Conclusion:
- The program is partially correct but lacks critical functionality required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not handle the Quaffle's reset and the catching of the Quaffle by a player.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
