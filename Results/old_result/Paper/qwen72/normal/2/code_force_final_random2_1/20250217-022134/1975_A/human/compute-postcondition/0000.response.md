Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.** 

The value of `t` is now an integer input by the user, which falls within the range 1 to 1000. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged and still represent the number of test cases and the array of integers, respectively, as described in the initial state.
