### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires verifying if a given set of numbers can form a progressive square based on the rules provided.
   - The progressive square is constructed using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It then reads \( n^2 \) integers representing the elements of the array \( b \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list \( l \) as input.
   - It finds the minimum value in the list \( l \) and assumes this to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It constructs a new list `li` by generating all possible values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - It sorts both the original list \( l \) and the generated list `li`.
   - It compares the sorted lists to check if they are identical.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum value in the list \( l \) as \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It generates the progressive square values correctly using the formula.
   - Sorting both lists ensures that the comparison is valid.
   - The comparison logic is correct: if the sorted lists are identical, the elements can form the progressive square; otherwise, they cannot.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The state before the function call is correctly described: \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), \( c \) and \( d \) are integers such that \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and \( l \) is a list of \( n^2 \) integers where \( 1 \le l[i] \le 10^9 \).
   - Inside the function, the minimum value \( a \) is correctly identified.
   - The nested loops generate the progressive square values correctly.
   - The state after the loop is correctly described: \( li \) has \( n^2 \) elements, each calculated as \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \).
   - Both lists are sorted, and the comparison is performed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
