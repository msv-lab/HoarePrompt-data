The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range limit `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than `2`, this will be the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value. If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1`. If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` > 78, `arr` remains an empty list and `lex` is the input integer.**
