Functionality: ** The function `func` generates 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, inclusive. For each set, it determines a string `res` based on the relationship between x, y, and z: if x < y and y > z, `res` is 'peak'; if x < y and y < z, `res` is 'stair'; otherwise, `res` is 'none'. The function prints each set of digits followed by the corresponding `res` string. After 1000 iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The final state is that `i` is 1001, and the program has printed 1000 lines of digit sets and their corresponding results. **
