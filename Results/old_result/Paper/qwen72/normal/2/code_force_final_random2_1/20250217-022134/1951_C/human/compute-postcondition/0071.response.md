To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `c` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1` after the loop.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.
   - `k` is the third integer from the input minus `n * s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.

2. **Computation of `c`:**
   - `c` is computed as the sum of `s * (l[j] + j * s)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Let's break this down further:
     - `s` is the minimum of `m` and the initial value of `k`.
     - For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
       - `l[j]` is the `j`-th element of the sorted list `l`.
       - `j * s` is the product of `j` and `s`.
       - `l[j] + j * s` is the sum of the `j`-th element of `l` and `j * s`.
       - `s * (l[j] + j * s)` is the product of `s` and the sum `l[j] + j * s`.
     - `c` is the sum of these products for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

Given the initial state and the computation of `c`, the output will be the integer value of `c` as described above.

Output: **int(c) (where c is the sum of s * (l[j] + j * s) for each j from 0 to n-1, and s is the minimum of m and the initial value of k)**
