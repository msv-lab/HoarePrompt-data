Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables (`C`, `D`, `E`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`) retain their previous values. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next pair in the `zip` object. The value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
