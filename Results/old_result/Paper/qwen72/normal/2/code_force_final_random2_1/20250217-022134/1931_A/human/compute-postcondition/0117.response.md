The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is determined based on the value of `lex`. However, regardless of the initial value of `arr`, appending `1` to `arr` will modify `arr`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 2.
- `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.
- `lex` is updated based on its initial value:
  - If `lex` < 28, `arr` was initially `[1]` and `lex` was updated to `lex - 1`.
  - If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` was initially `[26]` and `lex` was updated to `lex - 26`.
  - If 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, `arr` was initially `[26]` and `lex` was updated to `lex - 26`.
  - If `lex` > 78, `arr` was initially an empty list and `lex` remained the input integer.

After executing `arr.append(1)`, the value of `arr` will be:
- `[1, 1]` if `lex` < 28.
- `[26, 1]` if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.
- `[1]` if `lex` > 78 (since `arr` was initially an empty list).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value, `lex` is updated based on its initial value, and `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` < 28, `[26, 1]` if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52 or 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `[1]` if `lex` > 78.**
