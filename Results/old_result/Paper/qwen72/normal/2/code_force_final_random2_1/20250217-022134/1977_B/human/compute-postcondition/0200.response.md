Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a list of 30 elements where `s[0]` is '1', `s[1]` is '1', and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1', `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, `flag` is 0.**

The code snippet `flag = 0` does not change the value of `flag` since it was already 0 in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
