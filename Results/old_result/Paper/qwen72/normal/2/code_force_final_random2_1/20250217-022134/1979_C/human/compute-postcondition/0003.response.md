The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts (based on spaces), converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `T` is 0
- `bets` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` will contain the integers entered by the user. The values of `t`, `T`, and `bets` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
