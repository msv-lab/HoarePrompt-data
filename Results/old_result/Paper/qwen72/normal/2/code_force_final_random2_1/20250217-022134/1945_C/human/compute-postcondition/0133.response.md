Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `lst` contains at least as many elements as the number of iterations executed. `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `c1` remain unchanged.**
