The code updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
