Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least -1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 1. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` is a list containing two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `ans` is a list containing two elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2. If `i == 0`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`, and `sums + a[1]`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
