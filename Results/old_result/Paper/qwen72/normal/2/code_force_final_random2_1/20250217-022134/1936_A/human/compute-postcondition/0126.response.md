Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
