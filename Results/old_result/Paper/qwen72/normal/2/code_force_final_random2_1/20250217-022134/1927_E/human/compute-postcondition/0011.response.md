The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Given the parameter constraint that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and without additional context on how `t` influences the output or is used within the function, the description of the function's output cannot be fully determined from the provided information. However, based on the given structure, the function likely performs some operation or calculation internally and returns a result based on the predefined range of `t`.

Since no specific output or behavior related to `t` is described, I will assume the function returns a value or performs an action that is dependent on `t`, but the exact nature of this return or action is not specified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to perform an operation or return a value based on an internal variable `t`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The exact output or behavior is not specified.**
