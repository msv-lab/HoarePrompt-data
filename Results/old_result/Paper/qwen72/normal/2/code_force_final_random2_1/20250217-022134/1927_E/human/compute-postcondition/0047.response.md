To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `len(permutation)` for the next iteration.

### Current State:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`
- `len(permutation)` is `n`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`, which translates to `2 + 2*k < n`.

Given that `2 + 2*k` is the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, we need to ensure that this value is still less than `n` for the next iteration. Since `k` is an even number and `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the condition `2 + 2*k < n` should hold true as long as `k` is chosen appropriately.

However, since the problem specifies that `2 + 2*k` is the current value, we need to ensure that the next value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which would be `2 + 3*k` if `i` is incremented by 1) is still less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `2 + 3*k < n` for the next iteration to proceed.

Since `2 + 2*k < n` is already true, and `k` is a positive integer, incrementing `i` by 1 will result in `2 + 3*k`, which should still be less than `n` as long as `k` is chosen such that `2 + 3*k < n`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary to the current state because the condition `2 + 2*k < n` ensures that the next value `2 + 3*k` will also be less than `n` as long as the initial conditions are met.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros except for the elements at indices 1, k+1, 2*k+1, ..., (m-1)*k+1, which are set to m+1, m+2, m+3, ..., n-m; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 3 - m`; `i` is 2; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `permutation[2]` is `n + 1 - m`; `permutation[2 + k]` is `n + 2 - m`**.
