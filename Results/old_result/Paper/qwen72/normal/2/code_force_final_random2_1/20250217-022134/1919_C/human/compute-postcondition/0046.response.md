Output State: **`a` is the first element of `l` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `c` is 1 if `l[x-1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `b` is `l[x]`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
- `a` remains the first element of `l` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition.
- `c` remains 1 if `l[x-1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0.
- `y` remains the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met.
- `x` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
