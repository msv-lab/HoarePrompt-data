Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `line` is an input string.** 

The code snippet `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `result`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The new state includes the additional information that `line` now holds the value of the input string.
