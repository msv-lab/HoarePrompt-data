Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `m` times, so `m` remains an input integer.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `m-1` because the loop index starts from 0 and goes up to `m-1`.
- `sum_f` will be the cumulative sum of all `f` values input during the loop.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are input integers that are read in each iteration of the loop, but their final values will be those from the last iteration.
