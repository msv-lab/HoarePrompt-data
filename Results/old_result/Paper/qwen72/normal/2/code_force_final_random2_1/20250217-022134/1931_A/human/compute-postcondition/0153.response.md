The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range specified (which is fixed at 3). For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(3)`, meaning it should start from 0 and go up to 2.

Given the initial state, `j` is 2. However, for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be reset to 0 because the loop will iterate over the values 0, 1, and 2. The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 2, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
