Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. If `lista_A[2] < lista_B[2]`, then `pref` is the sum of its initial value and `lista_A[2]`, and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is the sum of its previous value and `lista_B[2]`, and `pref` retains its previous value.***
