Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `s`.

2. **Middle Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the middle index `pk` as `n // 2`. This is used to find the position closest to the middle of the string.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The program counts the total number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` using `sl.count('1')` and `sl.count('0')`. These counts are used to calculate the percentages later.

4. **Iterating Through Positions**: The program iterates through each possible position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) to check if the road can be placed after house `i`. It updates the counts of '0's and '1's as it moves through the string.

5. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's on both sides of the road. It uses `math.ceil` to ensure the percentage is rounded up correctly. The conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

6. **Finding the Optimal Position**: The program keeps track of all valid positions in the list `lst` and finds the position closest to the middle `pk` using the minimum absolute difference. It then sorts the list `final` to ensure the smallest valid index is printed.

7. **Handling No Valid Positions**: If no valid positions are found, the program checks the overall percentage of '1's in the string and prints 0 if the percentage is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n`.

8. **Output**: The program prints the first element of the `final` list for each test case, which is the optimal position for the road.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
