### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `n` for each one.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the program prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`.
   - For `n = 2`, the program prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the pattern `##..` and `..##` alternating.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##` and `..##..` alternating.
   - For `n = 4`, the program prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the pattern `##..##..` and `..##..##` alternating.
   - For any other value of `n`, the program prints "No esta en el rango".

3. **Pattern Matching**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` match the expected output as described in the problem statement.
   - However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is a limitation. The problem statement specifies that `1 <= n <= 20`, so the program should be able to handle any value within this range.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The program lacks a generalized approach to generate the checkerboard for any `n` within the specified range. It only handles specific cases explicitly, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid values of `n` (1 to 20) and only provides hardcoded solutions for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.

Correctness: **False**
