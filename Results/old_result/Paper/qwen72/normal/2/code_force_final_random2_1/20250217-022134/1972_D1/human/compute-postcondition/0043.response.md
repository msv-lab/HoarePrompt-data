Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` updates the values of `a` and `b` to the integer values of the first and second elements of the list `info`.
- The initial state already specifies that `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, so no changes are made to these variables.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
