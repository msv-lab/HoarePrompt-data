Postcondition: **`t` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x_a + a`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is either `r[5] - a` or `r[5] + a`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is set to 1, `y2` is set to `r[5] - a`, and `c` is `r[5] - a - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is set to `m`, `y2` is set to `r[5] + a`, and `c` is `m - y2`. Additionally, `b // 2` is greater than `a`, the absolute value of the difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`, `y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive, and `x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.**
