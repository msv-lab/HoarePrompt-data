Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, and `arr` is the last input string. The list `results` will contain a string ('yes' or 'no') for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each `arr` input during the loop: if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', 'no' is appended to `results`. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's but does not meet the specific condition, 'yes' is appended to `results`. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, 'no' is appended to `results`.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` must be a non-empty list containing strings ('yes' or 'no')

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` must be a non-empty list containing strings ('yes' or 'no')

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must be a list containing at least two strings ('yes' or 'no'), `r` is the next string in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
