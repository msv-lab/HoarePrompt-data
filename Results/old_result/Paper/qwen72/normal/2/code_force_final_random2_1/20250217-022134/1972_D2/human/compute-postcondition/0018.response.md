Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 1, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain as the positive integers provided by the input.
- **`x`**: This remains 1 throughout the loop.
- **`y`**: The loop increments `y` by 1 each iteration until either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Therefore, the final value of `y` is the smallest integer that makes one of these conditions true.
- **`cnt`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1, but only when the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1. This means `cnt` counts the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
