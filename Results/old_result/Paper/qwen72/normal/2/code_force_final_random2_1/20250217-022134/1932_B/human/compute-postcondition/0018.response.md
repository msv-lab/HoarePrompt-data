Output State: **`t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 4 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two results of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the element at index 5 in the list `data`.
- All other variables (`t`, `path`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
