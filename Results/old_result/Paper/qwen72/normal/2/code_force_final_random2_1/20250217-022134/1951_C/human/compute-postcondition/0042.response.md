The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the initial values of these variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the same as the initial value of `n`
- `m` is `b`
- `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - n * min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`
- `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`
- The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the input
- `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are reassigned new values from the input.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `c`, and the list `l` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the initial value of `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, and the list `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the input.**
