The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range value being greater than 0. Since the range is set to `2`, the loop will execute regardless of the initial state of `j`. However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be initialized to `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
