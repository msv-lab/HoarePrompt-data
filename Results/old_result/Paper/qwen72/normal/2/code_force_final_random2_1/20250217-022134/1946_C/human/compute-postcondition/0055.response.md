Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (and `b` is appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already contains `b` as one of its elements, `b` is added again to the list. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
