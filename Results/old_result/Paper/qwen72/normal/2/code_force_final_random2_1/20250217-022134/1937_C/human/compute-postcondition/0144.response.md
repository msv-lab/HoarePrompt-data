Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `I` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `R` is defined (but its value is not specified).
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `r` is the new user input.
   - `v1` remains the value it was last set to (or 0 if it was never set).
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1`: This variable retains its last set value or defaults to 0 if it was never set.
   - `i`: This is explicitly set to 3.
   - `prev`: This depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is not '>', `prev` is 0 (since the only other condition mentioned is that `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', but this is redundant with the first condition).

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

Given the conditions:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be:
  ```python
  ? [v1] 3 [v1] 2
  ```
- If `r` is not '>', the output will be:
  ```python
  ? [v1] 3 [v1] 0
  ```

Since `v1` could be any value (or 0 if it was never set), the most precise description is:

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the value of v1 and prev is 2 if r is '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
