Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is 4 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
