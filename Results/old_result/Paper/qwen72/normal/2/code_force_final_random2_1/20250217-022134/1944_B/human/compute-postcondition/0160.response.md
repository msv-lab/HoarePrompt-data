The value of `c[i]` is appended to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]` according to the initial state) is added to `ans2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` still holds true.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`).**
