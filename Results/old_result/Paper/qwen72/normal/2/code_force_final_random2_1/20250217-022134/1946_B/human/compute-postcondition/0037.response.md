The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of any other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `t` is now `(t * 2) % MOD`
- `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative
- `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`
- `i` is 2

After executing `t %= MOD`, the value of `t` is updated to `t % MOD`. Since `t` was already `(t * 2) % MOD`, the new value of `t` remains the same as before because `(t * 2) % MOD` is already within the range of `0` to `MOD-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the sum of the current non-negative contiguous subarray being considered, or 0 if it has become negative, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is 2**
