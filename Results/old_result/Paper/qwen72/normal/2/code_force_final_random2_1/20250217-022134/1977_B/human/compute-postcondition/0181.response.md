Output State: **`i` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`. `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, and `nalla` is 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is 30**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 29` (30 iterations), so after the loop completes, `i` will be 30.
- **`s` is a list of 30 elements**: The loop appends either '1' or '0' to the list `s` for each iteration, resulting in a list of 30 elements.
- **Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`**: For each bit position `i` in the binary representation of `x`, if the bit is set (1), '1' is appended to `s`; otherwise, '0' is appended.
- **`length` is 30**: The variable `length` remains unchanged at 30 throughout the loop.
- **`x` is an input integer**: The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is used to determine the elements of `s`.
- **`t` is greater than 1**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`nalla` is 2**: The value of `nalla` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
