Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `j`**: The loop for `j` starts from 4 instead of 1, which means it will miss many valid pairs where \( b \) is less than 4.

2. **Commented Out Code**: The code block inside the comment is not executed, and it seems to be an attempt to check the condition for each pair, but it is not used in the final solution.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The calculation of `x` is incorrect. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. It should be based on the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

4. **Subtracting 1 from `suma`**: The final result is `suma - 1`, which is not justified and can lead to incorrect results.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition correctly. It will produce the correct output for the given test cases.
