Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 as it was initially.***
