The function `func_1` takes a list `row` of non-negative integers (where the first and last elements are 0) and a positive integer `d` (where 1 <= d <= len(row)). It modifies the first `d-1` elements of `row` by incrementing each by 1. For the remaining elements, it sets each element to the minimum value of the sublist of length `d+1` ending at that element, plus the original value of that element, plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified `row`, which represents the sum of the minimum values of the sublists of length `d+1` starting from each position in `row`, plus the original value of the last element of `row`, plus the number of iterations (`len(row) - d + 1`).
