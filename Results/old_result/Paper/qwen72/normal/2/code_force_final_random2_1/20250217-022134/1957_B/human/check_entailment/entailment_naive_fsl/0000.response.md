Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence must equal `k`, and the sequence must contain exactly `n` elements. If `k` is less than `n`, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` without including negative numbers or violating the condition that all elements are non-negative.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 5 3
```
Here, `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The program will attempt to construct a sequence of 5 non-negative integers that sum to 3. However, the only way to do this is to have three 1s and two 0s, but the program does not handle this case correctly. It will output a sequence that does not meet the requirements, such as:
```
7 0 0 0 0
```
This sequence sums to 7, not 3, and thus fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
