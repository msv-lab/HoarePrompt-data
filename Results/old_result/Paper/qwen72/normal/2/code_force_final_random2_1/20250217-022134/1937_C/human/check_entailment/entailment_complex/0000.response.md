Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_3` starts by reading an integer `n` from the user.
   - If `n` is 2, it directly calls `func_2(0, 1)` and returns. This is correct because for `n = 2`, the only possible permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and the maximum XOR value is always `1` (i.e., `0 ⊕ 1` or `1 ⊕ 0`).

2. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The function initializes `max_index` to 0.
   - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This ensures that `max_index` is the index where `p_max_index` is the maximum value among all `p_i`.

3. **Finding Minimum Indices**:
   - The function initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
   - It iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`. Otherwise, it appends `i` to `min_indices`. This ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices where `p_i` is less than or equal to `p_min_indices[0]`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index**:
   - The function initializes `min_index` to the first element of `min_indices`.
   - It iterates through all elements in `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to `i`. This ensures that `min_index` is the smallest index among `min_indices` where `p_i` is equal to `p_min_index`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)` to output the indices that maximize the XOR value.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem statement and the constraints. The program correctly handles the special case for `n = 2` and uses the queries efficiently to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.

Correctness: **True**
