### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit from selling `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The modified price for the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - We need to find the optimal `k` to maximize the total profit.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
     - The term `k * b` accounts for the total price of the first `k` buns at the modified price.
     - The term `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts for the decreasing price of the first `k` buns.
     - The term `(n - k) * a` accounts for the price of the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - **`func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
     - It iterates using a binary search to find the `k` that gives the maximum profit.
     - For each `mid` value, it calculates the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits.
     - It adjusts the search range based on which profit is higher.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` ensures that we efficiently find the optimal `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the total profit.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
