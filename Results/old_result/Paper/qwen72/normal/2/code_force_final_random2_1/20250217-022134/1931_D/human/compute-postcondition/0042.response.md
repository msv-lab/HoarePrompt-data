Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**
