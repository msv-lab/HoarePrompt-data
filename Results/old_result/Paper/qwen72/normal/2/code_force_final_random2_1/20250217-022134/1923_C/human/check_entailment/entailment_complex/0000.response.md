### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), the number of queries (`m`), the array `l`, and the queries `(a, b)`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Array**: The program constructs a cumulative sum array `p` to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. This is done using the line:
   ```python
   for x in l:
       c += x
       p.append(c)
   ```
   Here, `c` keeps track of the running sum, and `p` stores these sums.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b]` using the cumulative sum array `p`. This is done with the following logic:
   ```python
   s = p[b - 1]
   if a - 2 >= 0:
       s -= p[a - 2]
   ```
   - `p[b - 1]` gives the sum of the subarray from the start to `b-1`.
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, it subtracts the sum of the subarray from the start to `a-2` to get the sum of the subarray from `a-1` to `b-1`.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying two conditions:
   - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
   - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

5. **Output**: Based on the conditions, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The use of the cumulative sum array `p` ensures efficient computation of subarray sums, and the conditions are checked accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
