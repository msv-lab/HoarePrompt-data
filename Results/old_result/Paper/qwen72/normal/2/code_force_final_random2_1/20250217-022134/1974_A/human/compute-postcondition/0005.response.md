The value of `t` is updated to the value of `b`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged. Since `b` is an integer (the second part of the input converted to an integer), `t` now holds this integer value.

Output State: **`t` is `b`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (the first part of the input converted to an integer).**
