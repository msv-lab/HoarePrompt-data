To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `t` is `(2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD`.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(k - 1)`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(k - 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k-1`.

### Adjustments:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will stop when `i` reaches `k-1`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `k-2`.

### Updated State:
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `_` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `k-2`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input with `k` > 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input and must have `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD`, `i` is `k-2`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`.**
