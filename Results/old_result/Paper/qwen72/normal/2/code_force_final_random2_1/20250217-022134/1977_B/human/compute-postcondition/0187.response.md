Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2, `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` is changed to '1'. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
