Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\), `suma` remains as calculated previously.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
