The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. This modifies the list `l1` by adding `a1` at the index `idx2`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is at least 3
- `val` is an empty list
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input
- `a1` is the first integer from the user input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new user input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates)
- `a3` is the first integer from the latest user input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest user input
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`

After executing the code snippet:
- `l1` now includes `a1` at the position `idx2`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`m` is at least 3, `val` is an empty list, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value of `i` before the loop terminates), `a3` is the first integer from the latest user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest user input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
