Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). The elements of `s` have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop: any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' and the subsequent bit set to '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is set have been changed to '1'. The final value of `flag` depends on the last operation performed in the loop. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 31, the 31st element of `s` is '1', and `s[29]` is '0'. Otherwise, `length` remains 30, and `flag` is not set or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
