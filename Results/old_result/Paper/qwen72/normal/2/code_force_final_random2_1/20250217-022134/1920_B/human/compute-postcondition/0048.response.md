Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `ans` as an empty list, which overrides the previous value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
