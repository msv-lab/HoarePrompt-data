The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is true. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the condition is false.**
