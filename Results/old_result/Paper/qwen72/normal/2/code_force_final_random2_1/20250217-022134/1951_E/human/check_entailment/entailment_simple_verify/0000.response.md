### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Issue**: The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. This approach is incorrect because it fails to handle strings of odd length correctly. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` will incorrectly return `False` because it only checks "ab" against "ba".
   - **Correct Approach**: To correctly check if a string is a palindrome, you should compare the entire string with its reverse. The correct implementation would be:
     ```python
     def func_1(ch):
         return ch == ch[::-1]
     ```

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Issue**: The function `func_2` attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It also has logic that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. For example, it returns a fixed number of parts without ensuring that each part is non-palindromic.
   - **Correct Approach**: The function should focus on determining how to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. The logic should ensure that each part is non-palindromic and that the partitioning is valid.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - **Issue**: The main logic of the program does not correctly handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings. It uses `func_2` to determine the number of parts but does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
   - **Correct Approach**: The main logic should iterate through the string and partition it into non-palindromic substrings. If a valid partition is found, it should print "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If no valid partition is found, it should print "NO".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions and main logic do not correctly handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
