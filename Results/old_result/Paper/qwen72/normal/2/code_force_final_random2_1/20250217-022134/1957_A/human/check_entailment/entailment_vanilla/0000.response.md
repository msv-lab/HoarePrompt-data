Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `arr` and updating the count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Formation**: The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides, but the program is only considering polygons with 4 sides (squares). This is a limitation in the logic, as it does not account for other possible regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.).

4. **Summation**: The program sums up the number of squares that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and taking the integer part. This is correct for counting squares but not for other types of polygons.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the number of squares that can be formed.

Given the problem statement, the program is only partially correct because it only considers squares and not other regular polygons. However, if we assume that the problem is specifically asking for the maximum number of squares that can be formed, then the program is correct.

However, since the problem statement asks for the maximum number of regular polygons (not just squares), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
