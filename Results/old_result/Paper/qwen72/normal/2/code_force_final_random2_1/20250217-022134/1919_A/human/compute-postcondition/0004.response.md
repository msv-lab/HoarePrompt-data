Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer provided by the user input, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with the constraint 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 0.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **Bob**
