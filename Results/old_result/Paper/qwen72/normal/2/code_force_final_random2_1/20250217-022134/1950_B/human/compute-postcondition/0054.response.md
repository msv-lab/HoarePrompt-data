The given `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions specified in the initial state. It simply prints a fixed string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies the following:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
   - `casos` must be greater than 1.
   - `c` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('##..##..')
   ```

3. This `print` statement outputs a fixed string `'##..##..'`.

Since the `print` statement does not involve any of the variables or conditions from the initial state, the output is straightforward.

Output: **##..##..**
