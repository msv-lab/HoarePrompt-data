Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is a positive integer that is larger than any number in the list `a`.
   - The condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` checks if `mexsize` is even.
   - If `mexsize` is even, the print statement will output 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, the print statement will output 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in the list and it is greater than `maxsize`, it must be the next integer after the largest integer in the list.
   - For example, if the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `maxsize` is 5 and `mexsize` would be 6.
   - In general, if the list `a` contains all integers from 1 to `maxsize`, then `mexsize` will be `maxsize + 1`.
   - Since `mexsize` is `maxsize + 1`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `mexsize` is `maxsize + 1`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will always be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even.
   - Therefore, the parity of `mexsize` depends on the parity of `maxsize`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `maxsize`, we can only determine the output based on the general rule that `mexsize` is `maxsize + 1`.

Output: **'Alice' if `maxsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and is greater than `maxsize`)**

Given the general rule, if `maxsize` is odd, `mexsize` will be even, and the output will be 'Alice'. If `maxsize` is even, `mexsize` will be odd, and the output will be 'Bob'. 

Since the exact value of `maxsize` is not provided, the most precise description is:

Output: **'Alice' if `maxsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob'**
