Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, `new_median` is the same as `median`, `b[ma]` is `median + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value at index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. Since `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, the new value at `b[ma]` is `median + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
