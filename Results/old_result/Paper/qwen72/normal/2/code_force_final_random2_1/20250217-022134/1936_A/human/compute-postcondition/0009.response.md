The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is already greater than 1, the condition for the loop to execute again is met.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
