The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` relative to `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `w` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.**
