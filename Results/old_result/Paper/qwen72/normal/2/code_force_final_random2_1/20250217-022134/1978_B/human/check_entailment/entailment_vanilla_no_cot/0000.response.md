Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit when `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which correctly accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence (for the modified prices) and the fixed price for the remaining buns.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - It iterates using binary search, calculating the profit for the current midpoint `mid` and the next midpoint `mid + 1`.
   - It updates the maximum profit found so far and adjusts the search range based on whether the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`.

The solution efficiently finds the maximum profit by leveraging binary search, ensuring that the time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the range of `k`. This approach is suitable for the constraints provided (up to \(10^9\) for `n`, `a`, and `b`), making it both correct and efficient.
