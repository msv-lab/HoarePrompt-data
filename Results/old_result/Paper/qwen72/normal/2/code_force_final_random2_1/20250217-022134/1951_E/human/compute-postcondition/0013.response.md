Postcondition: ***`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, then `a` is 2.***
