Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `j` is 0. If the first character of `s` (`s[j]`) is not equal to the second character of `s` (`s[j + 1]`), and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains 0.***
