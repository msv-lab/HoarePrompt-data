Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the condition that \(i < j\) for the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\). The current implementation counts pairs without ensuring that the first index is less than the second index, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following test case:

- \(n = 3\), \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\)
- \(a = [2, 4, 6]\)

In this case, the pairs \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\) and \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) are valid, but the pair \(\langle 2, 1 \rangle\) is also counted, which is invalid because \(i\) should be less than \(j\). This leads to an incorrect count of beautiful pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
