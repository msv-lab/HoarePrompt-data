Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
