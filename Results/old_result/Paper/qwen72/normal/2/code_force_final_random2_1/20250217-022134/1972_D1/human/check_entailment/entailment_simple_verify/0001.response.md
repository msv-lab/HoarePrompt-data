Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The commented-out code block is not executed and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs.
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - However, this formula is derived from a specific mathematical insight and needs to be verified against the problem's requirements.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This means \(a = k \cdot b \cdot d - b\), and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot d - b\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) correctly.
   - However, the final result is `suma - 1`, which might be incorrect if there are no valid pairs for some \(i\).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output for the given test cases should match the expected results.
   - The formula used might not always produce the correct count, especially for larger values of \(n\) and \(m\).

Given the complexity of the problem and the specific formula used, it is difficult to definitively state the correctness without further verification. However, based on the provided reasoning, the program seems to have logical issues and might not always produce the correct results.

Final: **False**
