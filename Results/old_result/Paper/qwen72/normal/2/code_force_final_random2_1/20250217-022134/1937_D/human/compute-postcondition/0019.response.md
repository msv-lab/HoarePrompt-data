Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_result` and `ans[n-1]` is set to `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_result)`. Otherwise, if `ol` is greater than `zr`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n-1]` is set to `n - oneInd + 1 - fi`.***
