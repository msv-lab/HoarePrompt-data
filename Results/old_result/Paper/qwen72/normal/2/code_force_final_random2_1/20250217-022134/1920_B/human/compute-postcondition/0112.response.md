Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and this value is appended to `ans`. If `i` is not 0, and `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and this new value is appended to `ans`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and this new value is appended to `ans`.***
