Postcondition: ***`k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k <= len(primes)`. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the value `1` has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < len(primes)`, `rest` is the value returned by `generate(k + 1)` and must contain at least one element, `prime` is `primes[k]`, and `prime_to_i` is `prime`.***
