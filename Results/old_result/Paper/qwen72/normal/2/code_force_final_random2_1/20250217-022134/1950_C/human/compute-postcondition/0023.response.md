The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the current value of `h`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm"
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer
- `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12
- If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM', and `h` is set to `h - 12`
- If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'
- Otherwise, `day` is 'AM' and `h` remains unchanged

After executing `h = h - 12`:
- The value of `h` is reduced by 12.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer minus 12, `day` is 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12, otherwise `day` is 'AM'.**
