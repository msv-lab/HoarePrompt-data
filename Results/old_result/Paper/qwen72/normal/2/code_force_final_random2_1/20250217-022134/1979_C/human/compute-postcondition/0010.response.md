The value of `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value by `a[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `prod` is now `a[0] * a[1] * a[2]`. The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is `a[0] * a[1] * a[2]`, `i` is 2**.
