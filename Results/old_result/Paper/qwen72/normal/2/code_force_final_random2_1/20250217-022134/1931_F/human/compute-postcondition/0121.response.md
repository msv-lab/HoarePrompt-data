To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3` from the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3
- `a1` is an input integer
- `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative
- `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1
- `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early
- `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`
- `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`
- `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`
- If `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` except `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original flow.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(a3, l3)` must be taken from the list `val`. The state of `a3` and `l3` will change to the values of the next tuple in `val`.

Since `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, and assuming the loop has not yet exhausted all tuples in `val`, the next tuple will be the one following the current one. Therefore, `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next tuple in `val`.

If the current tuple is the first tuple in `val`, then the next tuple will be the second tuple in `val`. If the current tuple is the second tuple in `val`, then the next tuple will be the third tuple in `val`, and so on.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is an input integer, `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the input and new input respectively, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both non-negative, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the loop broke early, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`**.
