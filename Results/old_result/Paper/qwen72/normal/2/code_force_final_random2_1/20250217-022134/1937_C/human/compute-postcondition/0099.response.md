Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to complete all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variables `I`, `R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The output buffer is flushed after each iteration, ensuring that the printed queries are visible to the user.
- The variable `r` is updated with the user's input after each query.
- The variable `prev` is updated to the current value of `i` whenever the user input `r` is '>'. If no such `i` exists (i.e., `r` is never '>'), `prev` remains 0.
- After the loop completes, `prev` will hold the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or it will remain 0 if `r` was never '>'.
