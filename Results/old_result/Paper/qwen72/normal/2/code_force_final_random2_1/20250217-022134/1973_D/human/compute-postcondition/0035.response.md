The code snippet reassigns the value of `l` to the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the initial state already specifies that `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, the reassignment does not change the value of `l`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 3, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**.
