Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `j` is 1, `2 * n + 1` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[0] % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`. If `dp[j]` (which is `dp[1]`) is greater than 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` (which is `new_dp[2]`) is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD`. If `dp[j]` (which is `dp[1]`) is 0, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
