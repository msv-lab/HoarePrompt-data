The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` to be `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the index being updated is `0`. The initial state specifies that the first element of `s` (at index 0) is '1'. After executing the code, this element is changed to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). The first element of `s` (at index 0) is now `'-1'`, and the second element of `s` (at index 1) is '0'.**
