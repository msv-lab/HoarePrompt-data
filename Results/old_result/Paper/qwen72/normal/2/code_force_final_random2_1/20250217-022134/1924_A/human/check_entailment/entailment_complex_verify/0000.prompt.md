You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s1` will contain all characters from `s` that were present in `alphabet` before being removed, and `s2` will contain all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had exactly one element left. The set `alphabet` will either be empty or reset to the original set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, depending on whether the last character processed caused a reset.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`. The boolean is determined by comparing the length of `s1` to `n * k`. The substring of `s1` starts from the position `r * k` and goes to the end of `s1`. `s2` contains all characters from `s` that were added when `alphabet` had exactly one element left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It processes the string `s` by iterating through its characters and maintaining two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are part of a dynamically changing set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the set has more than one element, the character is removed from the set; if the set has exactly one element, the character is added to `s2` and the set is reset to the original `k` alphabets. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2` which contains characters added when the set had exactly one element left.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the generation of all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checking if they occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not generate all possible combinations of strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`.

A specific case where the program fails is:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
bb
```

The program incorrectly outputs `No` and provides a string `bb` that it claims does not occur as a subsequence in `abba`, but `bb` is indeed a subsequence of `abba`. This indicates that the program's logic for generating and checking subsequences is flawed.
