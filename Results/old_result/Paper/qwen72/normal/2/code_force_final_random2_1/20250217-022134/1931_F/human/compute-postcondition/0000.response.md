Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n integers `a_{ij}`, where 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n and all `a_{ij}` are distinct, representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`. The sum of n · k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all the authors of the screenshots are different.**
