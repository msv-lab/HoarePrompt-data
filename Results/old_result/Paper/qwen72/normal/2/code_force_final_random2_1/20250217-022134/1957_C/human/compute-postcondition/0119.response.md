The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 8; `k` is 0; `i` is 4; `num` is the total number of times `num` was incremented based on the conditions inside the loop; `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 4; `n` is the first input integer; `t` is decreased by 1; `c` and `r` are the last set of input integers and remain unchanged; `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
