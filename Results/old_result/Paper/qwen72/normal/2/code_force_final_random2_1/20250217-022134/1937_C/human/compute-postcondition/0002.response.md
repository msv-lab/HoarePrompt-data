The provided code snippet calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `0` and `1`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact behavior or output of this function call. Without the function definition, we cannot know if any variables are modified or if any values are returned.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, and it is assumed to be within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- The current value of `n` is 2.

Since the function `func_2` is called but its definition is not provided, we cannot determine any changes to the state or any return values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, and it is assumed to be within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The current value of `n` is 2.**
