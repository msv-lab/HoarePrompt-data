The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 4 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two results of `func_1(path)`**
