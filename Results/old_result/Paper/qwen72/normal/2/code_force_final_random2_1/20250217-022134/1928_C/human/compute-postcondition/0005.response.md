Output State: **q and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, M is an empty list if w is not an integer or w < x - 1. If w is an integer and w ≥ x - 1, M is a list containing the integer w, where w is the square root of q, i is 1.** 

The variable `i` is now set to 1, while the conditions and values of `q`, `x`, and `M` remain unchanged from the initial state.
