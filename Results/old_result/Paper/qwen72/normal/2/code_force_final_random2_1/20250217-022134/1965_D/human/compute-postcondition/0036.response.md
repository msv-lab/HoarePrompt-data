Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array where 4 <= len(a) <= 1000, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` from index 0 to len(a)-1, followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from index 1 to len(a)-1, and now includes the value `a[2]` at the end, followed by the value `a[2] + a[3]`, and finally `a[2] + a[3] + a[4]`, `sm` is `a[2] + a[3] + a[4]`.**
