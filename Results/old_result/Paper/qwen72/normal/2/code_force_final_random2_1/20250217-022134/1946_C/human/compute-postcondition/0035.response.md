Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `L` remains unchanged, `R` is now equal to `x`, and `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, then `R` is 75001 and `x` is 62501. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, then `R` is 25001 and `x` is 12501.**
