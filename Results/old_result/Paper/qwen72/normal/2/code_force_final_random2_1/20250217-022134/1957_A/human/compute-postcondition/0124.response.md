Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the list. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the initial values of `t`, `n`, and the list of stick lengths remain unchanged, while the internal variables used for processing (such as `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes`) reflect the state of the last test case processed. **
