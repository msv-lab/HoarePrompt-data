Output State: **`zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, `pk` is set to `n // 2`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value \(10^8\) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the integer `0` and its length is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini` plus the value of `n`, and its length is 0. The values of `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `lst = []` initializes `lst` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`zero`, `one`, `o`, `c1`, `pk`, `mini`, `final`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `i`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
