Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0 or 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
