To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `char` and `expression`.

- The variable `char` will take each character from `expression` one by one.
- The loop will execute if `expression` is not empty.

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-".
- `length` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ length ≤ 5000.
- `count` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must contain at least one character. Since `length` is a positive integer and the minimum value of `length` is 1, `expression` will always have at least one character. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `expression` itself.

However, we need to specify the initial state of `char` and `expression` to ensure the loop can start:

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `char` is the first character of `expression`, `count` is 0**
