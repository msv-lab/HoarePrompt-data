Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1, `n` is an updated input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `n - 1` (or the last index of `l`), `y` is the smallest index such that `l[y] > l[y - 1]` and `y < n - 1` if such an index exists, otherwise `y` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[y]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` for some `y`, otherwise `b` remains 0, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[n - 1]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. Otherwise, `c` is 0, and `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= a` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] >= b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`.**
