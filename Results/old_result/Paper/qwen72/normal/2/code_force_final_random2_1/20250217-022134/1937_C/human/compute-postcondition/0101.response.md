Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, which means any pending output is written to the terminal or file immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program beyond ensuring that the output buffer is empty. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
