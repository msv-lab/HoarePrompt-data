The code `results.append(func_1(path))` appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the list `results`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `path`, which is the string at index 2 in `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`
- `path` is the string at index 2 in `data`
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces
- `index` is 3
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- `results` now contains the result of `func_1(path)`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 2 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`.**
