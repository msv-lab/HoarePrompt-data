Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration, if `a` is non-decreasing (`check_all` is `True`), 'YES' is printed. If `a` is not non-decreasing (`check_all` is `False`), the loop checks if the sub-list `new` (starting from the first decrease) is non-decreasing and all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If both conditions are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The loop iterates `t` times, and the final state reflects the results of these checks for each input list `a`.**
