Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or any other variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` was no longer less than `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it reached or exceeded `k`, `ans` is a list containing \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
