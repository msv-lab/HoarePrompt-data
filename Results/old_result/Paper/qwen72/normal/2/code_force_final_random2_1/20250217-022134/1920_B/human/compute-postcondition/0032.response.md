The code snippet `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` updates the value of `sums` based on the existing values of `sum1` and the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` must be at least 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`
- `i` is 2

The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. This means `sums` is updated to the difference between `sum1` and twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.
