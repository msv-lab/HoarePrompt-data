The code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The initial value of `mexsize` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `sz` is equal to 1. Since `sz` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `sz` can be any integer value from the list. If `sz` is 1, `mexsize` was initially 2; otherwise, `mexsize` was initially 1.

After the code executes, `mexsize` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `mexsize` will be:

- If `sz` is 1, `mexsize` will be 3.
- If `sz` is not 1, `mexsize` will be 2.

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to 1, `mexsize` is 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` is 2.**
