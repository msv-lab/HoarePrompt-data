### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha.
- Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
- Sasha concatenates two numbers and inserts the result back into the list.
- The game ends when only one number remains, and Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).

#### Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
   - **Initial Check**: If `n == 1`, it returns 'Sasha' if the length of the minimum of `n` and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This is incorrect because it should check the length of the elements in `nums`, not `n`.
   - **Sum of Digits Lengths**: It calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`.
   - **Trailing Zeros Calculation**: It sorts the trailing zeros count of each number in descending order and subtracts the even-indexed values from the total length.
   - **Final Decision**: It returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total length is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise 'Anna'.

2. **Function `zerocnts(num)`**:
   - It calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function incorrectly uses `n` instead of the elements in `nums` when checking the length of the reversed number.
- For the test case:
  ```
  Input:
  1
  2 2
  14 2
  ```
  The function should return 'Sasha' because Sasha can always form a number greater than or equal to 100 (e.g., 412 or 214) after Anna's move. However, the provided code returns 'Anna' due to the incorrect use of `n`.

#### Corrected Function:
To fix the issue, we need to correctly handle the reversal and comparison of the elements in `nums` rather than using `n`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    if n == 1:
        return 'Sasha' if len(str(min(nums))) >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

    tot = sum(len(str(val)) for val in nums)
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The provided code has a logical error that affects the correctness of the solution.
- The corrected function addresses the identified issue and should produce the correct results for the given problem.

Final: **False**
