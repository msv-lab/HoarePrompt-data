Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one can be returned.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

4. **String Construction**: The program constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times. However, this approach does not ensure that the resulting string `s` will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters.

5. **Validation**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `"ab"`, which contains both "a" and "b" as subsequences. This is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `s` is `"aa"`, which contains "aa" as a subsequence. This is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `"aabb"`, which does not contain "ba" as a subsequence. This is incorrect.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` is `"aabbcc"`, which does not contain "ca" or "cb" as subsequences. This is incorrect.

6. **Efficiency and Correctness**:
   - The approach of repeating the first `k` characters `n` times does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered. For example, in the case of `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `"aabb"` does not cover the subsequence "ba".
   - The program needs to ensure that the generated string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. The current implementation fails to do so.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement and does not generate the correct output for all given examples.

Final: **False**
