Postcondition: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `n`, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided by the user during the final iteration. If any input `a` was 1, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1. If any input `a` was 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2. All other `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 are added to the set `cx`. The variable `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains three elements: the first element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, the second element is `0`, and the third element is `0`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` contains three identical elements each equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
