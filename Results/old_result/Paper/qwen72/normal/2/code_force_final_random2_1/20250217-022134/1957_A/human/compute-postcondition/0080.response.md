Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will contain the count of unique elements in the list `palka` that appear 3 or more times. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
