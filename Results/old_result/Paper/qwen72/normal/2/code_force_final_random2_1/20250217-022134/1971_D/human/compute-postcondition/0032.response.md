Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1. If `flag` is True (indicating there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`), then `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus 1 minus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains the number of transitions between different characters in `s` plus 1, and `flag` is False.***
