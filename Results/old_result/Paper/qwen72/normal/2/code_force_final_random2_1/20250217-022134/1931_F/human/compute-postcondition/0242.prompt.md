Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 1, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1. If `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` < `idx2`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position `idx1`, and `l` is now a reference to `l2`. If `idx1` >= `idx2`, `l1` now includes the element `a1` at the index `idx2`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1` <= `idx2` and `m` is equal to 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is now equal to `l1` and `a1` is placed at the position `idx2` in `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1` and `l` is now a reference to `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)` from the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
