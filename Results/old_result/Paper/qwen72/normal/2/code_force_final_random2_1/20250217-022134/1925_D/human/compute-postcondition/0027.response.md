The value of `sum_f` is incremented by the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `sum_f` was initially 0, after adding `f`, `sum_f` now equals `f`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**.
