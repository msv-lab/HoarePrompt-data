Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` and `c` remain as they were before the loop started. Additionally, `a` is less than `l[x]`.**
