The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of a specific integer in the `arr` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4.**
