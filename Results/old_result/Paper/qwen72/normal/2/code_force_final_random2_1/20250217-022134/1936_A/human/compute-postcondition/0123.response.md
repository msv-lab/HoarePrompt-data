Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1, 2]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[1, 2]`.***
