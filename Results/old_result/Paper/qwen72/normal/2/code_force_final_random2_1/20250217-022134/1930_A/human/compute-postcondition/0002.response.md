The code snippet `numInteger = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `numInteger`. This means that `numInteger` will now hold the integer value entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `numCases`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer.**
