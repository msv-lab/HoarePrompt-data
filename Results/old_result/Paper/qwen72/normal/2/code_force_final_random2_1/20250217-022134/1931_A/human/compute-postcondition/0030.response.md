The only variables in the loop head are `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will run twice as long as `j` is within this range.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, since the loop condition is `range(2)`, which means `j` should be less than 2 for the loop to continue, the loop will not execute again after `j` is incremented to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the final iteration if it were to occur) would be:
State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged based on the conditions given**. 

However, since `j` is now 2, the loop will not execute again.
