Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It checks if the list `l` can be transformed into a new list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, with `a` being the minimum value in `l`. If the sorted version of `l` matches the sorted `li`, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function ensures that the final state of the program includes `n` remaining an integer within the specified range, `k` and `h` being the last values used in the loop, and `li` containing `n^2` elements in a specific pattern. **
