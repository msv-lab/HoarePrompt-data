The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be greater than 0, after decrementing, `t` will be an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 3, and it will still be greater than 0 unless it was 1 initially. The fact that `func_1()` has been called three times remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 3, `func_1()` has been called three times, and `t` must be greater than 0 (unless it was 1 initially, in which case it is now 0).**
