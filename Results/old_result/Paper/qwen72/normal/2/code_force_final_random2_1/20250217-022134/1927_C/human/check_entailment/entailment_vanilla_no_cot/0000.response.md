Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, checks the conditions for choosing elements from two arrays to ensure that all integers from 1 to k are included, and outputs the correct results for the given examples. The logic in `func_1` effectively determines whether it is possible to select the required elements by considering the unique elements in each array, their intersection, and ensuring that the total number of distinct elements is at least k while respecting the limit of k/2 elements from each array.
