Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `tree`, `empty`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are now integers provided by the user.
