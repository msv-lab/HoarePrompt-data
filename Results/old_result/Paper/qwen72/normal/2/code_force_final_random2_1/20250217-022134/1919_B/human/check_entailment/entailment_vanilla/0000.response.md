Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as input.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments `count`.
   - It calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which represents the number of '-' characters.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Penalty Calculation:**
  - The penalty of a subarray is defined as \( | \text{sum of elements} | \times \text{length of subarray} \).
  - The program's approach is to count the number of '+' and '-' characters and then compute the difference between these counts.
  - However, this approach does not directly address the problem of minimizing the total penalty by splitting the array into subarrays.

- **Optimal Splitting:**
  - To minimize the total penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
  - This can be achieved by ensuring that each subarray has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, or as close to equal as possible.

- **Program's Output:**
  - The program returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
  - This value does not necessarily represent the minimum possible penalty, as it does not account for the optimal splitting of the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
