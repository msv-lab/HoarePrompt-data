To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head specifies that `i` should iterate from 1 to `n // k`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `n // k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2.
- The condition `n // k + 1` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2` (adjusted to ensure the loop continues)
- `cnt` is 0 (unchanged)
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1` (unchanged)
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` (unchanged)

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
