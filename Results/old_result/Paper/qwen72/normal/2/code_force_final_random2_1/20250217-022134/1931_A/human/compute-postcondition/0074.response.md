The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` can be one of four possible lists: `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `1` to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be:

- If `arr` was `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was `[26, 1]`, it becomes `[26, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 1]`.
- If `arr` was `[26, 26]`, it becomes `[26, 26, 1]`.

All other variables (`n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 1, and `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` was less than 28, or `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if the original `lex` was ≥ 28. If `lex` ≥ 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, lex - 26]] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, or [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if 52 ≤ `lex` < 78, or [[26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` ≥ 78. If `lex` > 78, `info` and `arr` remain unchanged.**
