The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` has one additional element equal to `a[0] - T[0]`**
