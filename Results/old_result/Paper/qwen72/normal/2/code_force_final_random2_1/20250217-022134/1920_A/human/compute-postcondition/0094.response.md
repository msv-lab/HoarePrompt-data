Postcondition: ***`i` is the second element of `no`, `no` is a non-empty list containing all values of `a` where `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.***
