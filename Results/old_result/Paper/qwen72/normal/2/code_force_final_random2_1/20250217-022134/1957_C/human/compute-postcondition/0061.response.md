The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `num` is not specified, we only know that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is increased by 1.**
