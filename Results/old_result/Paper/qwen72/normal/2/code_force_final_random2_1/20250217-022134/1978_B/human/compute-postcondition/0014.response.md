Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is either 0 or `(min(n, b) // 2) + 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `high` is either the minimum of `n` and `b` or `(min(n, b) // 2) - 1` depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than or equal to `profit_mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`. `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The value of `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) retain their previous values or conditions.
- The condition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time remains unchanged.
