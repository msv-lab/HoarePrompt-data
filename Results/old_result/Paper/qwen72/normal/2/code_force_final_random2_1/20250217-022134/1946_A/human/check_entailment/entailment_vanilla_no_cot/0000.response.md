Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution is incorrect because it counts the occurrences of the current median instead of calculating the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate how many operations are required to make the current median equal to this next higher value. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        # Find the next element greater than the current median
        next_median = current_median
        for i in range(p + 1, n):
            if a[i] > current_median:
                next_median = a[i]
                break
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p, -1, -1):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
        print(operations)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
