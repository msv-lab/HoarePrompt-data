Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list `a`, finds the median element (or the middle element if the list length is odd), counts how many times this median element appears in the list, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, leaving no lasting changes to the input variables. **
