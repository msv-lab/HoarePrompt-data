The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length is equal to `n`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- The length of `ans` is initially 2.
- The number of zeros to append is calculated as `n - len(ans)`, which is `n - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
