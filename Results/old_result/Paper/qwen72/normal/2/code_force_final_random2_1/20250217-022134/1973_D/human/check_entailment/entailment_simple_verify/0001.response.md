### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and its maximum value equal to \( m \).
   - We can make up to \( 2n \) queries to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function Definitions:**
     - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4` are helper functions for reading input.
     - `func_5` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

3. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) from input.
     - Initializes \( v \) to 1.
   - **Finding the Maximum Value \( v \):**
     - Iterates from \( n \) down to 1, querying \( f(1, i \times n) \).
     - If the response \( v \) equals \( n \), sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
     - **Annotation:** This loop is intended to find the maximum possible value \( v \) such that \( f(1, v \times n) = n \). However, this approach might not always find the correct \( v \) because it only checks \( f(1, i \times n) \) and not all possible subarrays.
   - **Checking Possible Values for \( m \):**
     - Iterates over possible values of \( i \) from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \).
     - For each \( i \), initializes \( cnt \) to \( k \) and \( l \) to 1.
     - While \( cnt \) is greater than 0 and \( l \) is less than \( n + 1 \):
       - Queries \( f(l, i \times v) \).
       - Updates \( l \) to the response plus 1 and decrements \( cnt \).
     - If \( cnt \) reaches 0 and \( l \) equals \( n + 1 \), prints \( i \times v \) as the answer and returns.
     - **Annotation:** This part of the code is designed to check if the current value of \( i \times v \) can be used to split the array into \( k \) subarrays. However, it assumes that \( v \) is the correct maximum value, which might not be true if the initial loop did not find the correct \( v \).
   - **No Valid \( m \) Found:**
     - If no valid \( m \) is found, prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initial Loop for Finding \( v \):**
     - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1)` is intended to find the maximum value \( v \) such that \( f(1, i \times n) = n \). However, this approach is flawed because it only checks \( f(1, i \times n) \) and not all possible subarrays. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and \( n = 4 \), the loop will not correctly identify the maximum value \( v \) because it only checks \( f(1, 4) \), \( f(1, 8) \), etc., which are not necessarily the correct subarrays.
   - **Checking Possible Values for \( m \):**
     - The logic for checking possible values of \( m \) is correct, but it relies on the assumption that \( v \) is the correct maximum value, which might not be true due to the flawed initial loop.
   - **Handling Interaction:**
     - The program correctly handles the interaction with the judge and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in the initial loop for finding the maximum value \( v \). This flaw can lead to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
