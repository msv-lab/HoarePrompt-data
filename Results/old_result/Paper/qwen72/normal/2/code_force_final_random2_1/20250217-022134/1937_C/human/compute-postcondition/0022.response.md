To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the function call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `i`.
   - Since `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`, `min_indices[0]` is equal to `max_index`.

2. **Substitute the values:**
   - The function call becomes `res = func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.

3. **Determine the behavior of `func_1`:**
   - The behavior of `func_1` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement. However, we know that `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`.
   - Given that `max_index` is the largest index for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`, we can infer that `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` might return a specific value or perform a specific operation.

4. **Evaluate the function call:**
   - Since `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` is called, and we don't have the exact definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` without more information.
   - However, we can say that `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0.
- `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`.
- `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and n is not equal to 2; `i` is 0; `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns `<`. If no such `i` exists, `max_index` remains 0; `min_indices` is a list containing `[max_index]`; `res` is the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.**
