Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This will print the string `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2` separated by spaces.

Substituting the values of `v1` and `v2`:
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

So the output will be:
```
? 0 0 1 1
```

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
