Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by 2 * (a[2] - a[1]), and `r` is equal to `a[2]`.***
