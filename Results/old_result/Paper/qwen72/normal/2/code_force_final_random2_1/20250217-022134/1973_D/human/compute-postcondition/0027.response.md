The code snippet updates the value of `l` by calling `func_2()` and adding 1 to its return value. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we can state that `l` is now equal to the return value of `func_2()` plus 1.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 1`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**
