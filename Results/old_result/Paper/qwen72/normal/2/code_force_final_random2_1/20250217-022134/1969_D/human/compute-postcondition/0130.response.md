The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop can execute again if `test_cases` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the entire process.**
