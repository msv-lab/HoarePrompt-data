Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
