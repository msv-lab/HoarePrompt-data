The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 1; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is more than 1, or `b` remains an empty string if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is 0.**
