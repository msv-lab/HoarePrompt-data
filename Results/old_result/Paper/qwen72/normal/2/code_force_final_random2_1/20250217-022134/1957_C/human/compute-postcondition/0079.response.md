The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `m` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `m` must still be at least 4 (or greater) for the condition `i < m + 1` to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 5, `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, `dp[3]` = 8, and `dp[4]` = 26.**
