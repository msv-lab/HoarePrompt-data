Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the final value of `beautiful_count`.
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']` with all its elements processed.
- `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in `a`.
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
```

This statement will print the string "Beautiful pairs count: " followed by the value of `beautiful_count`.

Since `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution, the output will be the specific number of such pairs.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where [beautiful_count] is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop execution)**
