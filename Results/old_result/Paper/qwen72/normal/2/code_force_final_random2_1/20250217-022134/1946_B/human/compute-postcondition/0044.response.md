Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of standard input, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(t * (2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers read from the next line of standard input, which is exactly what this code does.
- The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and updates the value of `a` to reflect that it is now a list of integers read from the next line of standard input.
