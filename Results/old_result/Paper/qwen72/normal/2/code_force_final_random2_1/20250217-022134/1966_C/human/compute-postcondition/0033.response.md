Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
