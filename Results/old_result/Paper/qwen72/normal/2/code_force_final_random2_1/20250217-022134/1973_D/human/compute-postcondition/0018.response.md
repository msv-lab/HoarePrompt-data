The code snippet `v = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the initial state specifies that `v` is already the return value of `func_2()`, executing this line does not change the value of `v`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**
