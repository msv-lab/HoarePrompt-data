Output State: **`t` is at least 1, the input file has been fully processed, `line` is the last line of input data for the last test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) remains at least 1, indicating that there was at least one test case. The input file has been completely read, with the loop processing every relevant line. The variable `line` holds the content of the last line of input data for the final test case, and `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting this last line by whitespace. All test cases have been processed, and the loop has completed its execution.
