Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `path` is the string at index 4 in `data`, `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
