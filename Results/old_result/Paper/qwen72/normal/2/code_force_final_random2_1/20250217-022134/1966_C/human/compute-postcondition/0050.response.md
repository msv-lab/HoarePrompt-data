Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`.** 

The list `a` has been sorted in ascending order, but the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged.
