Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 that must have at least one element, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.***
