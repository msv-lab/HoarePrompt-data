Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 3 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, `lst` is `[1, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `lst` is `[2, 3]`.***
