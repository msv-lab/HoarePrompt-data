Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). `t` is an empty list. `ans` is -1, and `i` is 29. If the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 0, then `a` is a list containing the values of `ai` whenever `op` was 0 after processing each element in the original `a`. `v` is even, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, and `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0. If `u` is 1, then if `v` is odd, the current iteration is skipped. If `v` is even and non-zero, `val` is the last element of `a`, `ans` is the maximum of -1 and `cnt`, and `op` is the result of XORing the bits at position 29 of all elements in `a`. If the final value of `op` is 0, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0; otherwise, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0 minus 1. If `v` is zero, the loop or if statement is exited.***
