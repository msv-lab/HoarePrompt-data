You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

For each test case, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `case['array']`, and `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders when an element of `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair of remainders appears in `a`. The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution for each test case.

    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Each element in `results` represents the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the condition that \(i < j\) for the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\). The current implementation counts pairs without ensuring that the first index is less than the second index, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the following test case:

- \(n = 3\), \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\)
- \(a = [2, 4, 6]\)

In this case, the pairs \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\) and \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) are valid, but the pair \(\langle 2, 1 \rangle\) is also counted, which is invalid because \(i\) should be less than \(j\). This leads to an incorrect count of beautiful pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
