Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is [1, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is the input integer minus 1 (with the current value of `lex` being less than 27), and `info` is [[1, 1, lex]] if the original `lex` was less than 28, or `info` is [[26, 26, lex - 52]] if the original `lex` was ≥ 28.**
