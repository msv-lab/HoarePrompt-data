The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is equal to `k`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
