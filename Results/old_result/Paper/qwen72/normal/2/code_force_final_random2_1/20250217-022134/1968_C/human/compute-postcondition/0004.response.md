Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, and it satisfies 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. n is now an input integer. `line` is a string containing user input.**
