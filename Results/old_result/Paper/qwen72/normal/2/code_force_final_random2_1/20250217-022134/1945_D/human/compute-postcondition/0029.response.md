Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`. `pref` is the sum of all elements from `lista_A` that were less than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` during the loop, plus the cumulative `soma_b` values added to it when `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`. `soma_b` is the sum of all elements from `lista_B` that were greater than or equal to their corresponding elements in `lista_A` during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - k` times, so `i` will be `n - k - 1` after the last iteration.
- `pref` accumulates the values of `lista_A[i]` whenever `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, and also any accumulated `soma_b` values at those points.
- `soma_b` accumulates the values of `lista_B[i]` whenever `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
