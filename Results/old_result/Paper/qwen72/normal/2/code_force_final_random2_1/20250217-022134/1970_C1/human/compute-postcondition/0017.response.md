Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `tree` is a deque containing `[v]` (where `v` is the integer provided by user input), `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer provided by user input, and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. Additionally, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. The current value of `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**
