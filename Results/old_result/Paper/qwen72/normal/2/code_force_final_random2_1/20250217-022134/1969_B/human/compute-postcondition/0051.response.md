Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - len(s)`.
- `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of 0s in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of 1s in `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as follows:
  - The sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s`.
  - Plus the sum of 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` for each 0 in `s`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s`:**
   - Since `cnt[0]` is the count of 0s in `s`, `zeroes - cnt[0]` is always 0 because `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` are the same.
   - Therefore, the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` is 0.

2. **Sum of 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` for each 0 in `s`:**
   - If `cnt[1] > 0`, then for each 0 in `s`, we add 1.
   - If `cnt[1] == 0`, then for each 0 in `s`, we add 0.
   - Therefore, this part of the sum is `cnt[0]` if `cnt[1] > 0`, otherwise it is 0.

### Final Calculation:
- If `cnt[1] > 0`, then `ans = cnt[0]`.
- If `cnt[1] == 0`, then `ans = 0`.

### Example:
- If `s = [0, 1, 0, 1]`, then `cnt[0] = 2` and `cnt[1] = 2`.
  - `ans = 2` because `cnt[1] > 0`.

- If `s = [0, 0, 0]`, then `cnt[0] = 3` and `cnt[1] = 0`.
  - `ans = 0` because `cnt[1] == 0`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` based on the conditions described above.
Output: **ans (where ans is the count of 0s in s if there is at least one 1 in s, otherwise 0)**
