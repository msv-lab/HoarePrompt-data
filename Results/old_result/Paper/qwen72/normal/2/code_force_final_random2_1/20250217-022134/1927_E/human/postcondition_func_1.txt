The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` is 0, and `func_1` has been called `t` times, where `t` is the initial value provided by the user. The function does not return any value.
