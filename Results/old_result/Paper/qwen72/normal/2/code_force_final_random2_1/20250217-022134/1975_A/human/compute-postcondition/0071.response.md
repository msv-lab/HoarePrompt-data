Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 2 to the end. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, then these conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the conditions for `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `check_all` remain unchanged. In both the if and else parts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
