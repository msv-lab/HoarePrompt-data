Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list that contains at least one tuple.
- Each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers.
- `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the first tuple in `val`.
- The list `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`.

Output: **no**
