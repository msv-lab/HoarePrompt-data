To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `ele` and `lst`.

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The variable `ele` will take the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, the key points to consider are:
- `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `ele` should be the first element of `lst` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`**
