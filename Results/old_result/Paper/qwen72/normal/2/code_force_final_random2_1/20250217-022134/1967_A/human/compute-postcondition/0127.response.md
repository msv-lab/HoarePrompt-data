Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers from user input.
2. **`i`**: `n-2`, where `n` is the first integer from the input split.
3. **`n`**: The first integer from the input split.
4. **`k`**: 0.
5. **`r`**: The last value of `a` that was updated.
6. **`rem`**: `k % (i + 1)`, where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.
7. **`y`**: `n - 1 - i`, where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the first integer from the input split. Let's denote it as `n`.
2. **`i`**: This is `n-2`. So, `i = n - 2`.
3. **`k`**: This is 0.
4. **`r`**: This is the last value of `a` that was updated. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the last element of `a` after any updates.
5. **`rem`**: This is `k % (i + 1)`. Since `k` is 0, `rem = 0 % (i + 1) = 0`.
6. **`y`**: This is `n - 1 - i`. Substituting `i = n - 2`, we get `y = n - 1 - (n - 2) = 1`.

### Calculation:
Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```
- **`r - 1`**: This is the last value of `a` minus 1.
- **`(r - 1) * n`**: This is the product of `(r - 1)` and `n`.
- **`1`**: This is a constant.
- **`rem`**: This is 0.
- **`y`**: This is 1.

So, the expression becomes:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 1
```
Simplifying further:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 2
```

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `(r - 1) * n + 2`, where `r` is the last value of the sorted list `a` after any updates, and `n` is the first integer from the input split.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 2 (where r is the last value of the sorted list a after any updates, and n is the first integer from the input split)**
