To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- The loop will execute again if there are remaining iterations as specified by the initial `int(input())`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The values of `n` and `k` are read from the input. These are integers.
2. **Condition Check**: The `print` statement evaluates the condition `n - k <= 1`.
   - If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, the value of `n` is printed.
   - If the condition `n - k <= 1` is false, the value `1` is printed.

### Possible Outcomes:
- **Case 1**: If `n - k <= 1` is true, then the value of `n` will be printed.
- **Case 2**: If `n - k <= 1` is false, then the value `1` will be printed.

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the logic of the `print` statement, the output will be either the value of `n` or `1`, depending on the condition `n - k <= 1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
