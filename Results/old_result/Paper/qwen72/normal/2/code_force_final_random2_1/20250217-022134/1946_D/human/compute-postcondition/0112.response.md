Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation of the 29th bit of each element in `a`, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0. If `u` is 0, `op` is the XOR of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` that contributed to making `op` zero at some point during the loop, and `a` is now a list containing the values of `ai` each time `op` became zero. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is even and not zero, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `u` is not 0 and `v` is zero, the loop or if statement is exited.***
