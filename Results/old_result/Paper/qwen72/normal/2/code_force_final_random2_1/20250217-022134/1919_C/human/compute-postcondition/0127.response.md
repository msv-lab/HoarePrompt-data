Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` and `c` remain as they were before the loop started. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[x]` and `c` remains unchanged.**
