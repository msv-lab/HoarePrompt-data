The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state provides context about the variables and conditions but does not affect the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and it is currently set to 3.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1 or 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output will always be the same.

Output: **##..##**
