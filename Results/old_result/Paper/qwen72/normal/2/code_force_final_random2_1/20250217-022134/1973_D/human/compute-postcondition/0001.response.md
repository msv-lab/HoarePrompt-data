Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and their values are updated to those returned by `func_3()`. `v` is 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `v` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were updated by `func_3()`, which means they are still positive integers within the specified range. No other variables are affected.
