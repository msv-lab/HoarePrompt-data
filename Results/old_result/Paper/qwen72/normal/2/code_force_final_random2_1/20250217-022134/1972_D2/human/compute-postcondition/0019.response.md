Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `x` is 2, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of (`n` // ((`x` + `y`) * `x`)) and (`m` // ((`x` + `y`) * `y`)) for all `y` from 1 to the final value of `y` - 1 where the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are positive integers provided by the input.
- The value of `y` remains the same, as it is defined based on the conditions involving `x` and `y`.
- The value of `cnt` remains the same, as it is calculated based on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
