Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic implemented in the function `func` calculates the sum of the floor division of the count of each unique element by 3. This does not align with the game's rules and objectives.

The game requires calculating the maximum points a player can score under the condition that the opponent (Nene) plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. The current implementation does not consider the alternating turns, the strategic placement of cards, or the scoring system based on the presence of matching cards on the table.

A correct solution would need to simulate the game or use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the player's score while considering Nene's optimal play.
