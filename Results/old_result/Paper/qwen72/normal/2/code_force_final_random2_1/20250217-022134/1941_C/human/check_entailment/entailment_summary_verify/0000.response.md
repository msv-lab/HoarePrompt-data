### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program processes the string by sequentially removing occurrences of "map" and "pie". However, this approach can lead to incorrect results when the substrings overlap or appear in different orders.
   - For example, consider the string "mapie":
     - The program will first find and remove "map" from "mapie", resulting in "ie".
     - It will then check for "pie" and not find it, returning 1.
     - However, the correct answer should be 2, because we need to remove both 'm' and 'p' to make the string "aie" beautiful.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is a hardcoded solution for a specific input. While it might work for that particular input, it does not generalize to other overlapping cases.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The program should consider all possible overlaps and ensure that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that accounts for all possible overlaps.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string and count the number of removals.
- However, the function does not account for overlapping substrings, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly those involving overlapping substrings.
- The program's logic is flawed, and it does not always return the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping substrings and may return incorrect results for certain inputs.
