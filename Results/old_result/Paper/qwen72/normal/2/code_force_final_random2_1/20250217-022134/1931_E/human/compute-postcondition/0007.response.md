To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9.
- `tot` is 1.
- `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
- The loop breaks if the last character of `num` (i.e., `num[i]`) is not '0'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(num) - 2`.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` must be `len(num) - 2` for the next iteration to occur.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
- `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `len(num) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**.
