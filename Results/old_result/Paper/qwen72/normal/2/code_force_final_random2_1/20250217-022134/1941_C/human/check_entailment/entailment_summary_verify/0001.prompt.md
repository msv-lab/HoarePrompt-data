You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

    0

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns the total number of times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' were found and removed from the string. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it processes the string to remove occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', counting each removal, and returns the total count of these removals. After the function completes, the string `s` will no longer contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The function `func_1` should return the minimum number of deletions required.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of deletions.
   - It uses a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` for each removal.
   - Similarly, it uses another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie" by slicing the string and incrementing `ans` for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of deletions.

3. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function includes a special case where if the string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. This is a specific optimization but not necessary for the general solution.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "pie" or "map") by returning 0.
   - It also handles cases where multiple occurrences of "pie" or "map" are present by repeatedly finding and removing them.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function uses a while loop to find and remove substrings, which is efficient enough given the constraints (sum of n over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\)).

6. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the function:
     - For "mmapnapie", it removes "map" and "pie" once each, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - For "azabazapi", it does not need any deletions.
     - For "mappppie", it removes "map" and "pie" once each, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - For "mapmapmapmapmapmap", it removes "map" six times, resulting in 6 deletions.
     - For "p", it does not need any deletions.
     - For "pppiepieeee", it removes "pie" twice, resulting in 2 deletions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by removing occurrences of "pie" and "map". The function handles all edge cases and test cases correctly.
