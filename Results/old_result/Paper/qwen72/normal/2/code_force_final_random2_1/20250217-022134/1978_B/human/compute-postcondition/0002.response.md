To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `low <= high` is true when the loop starts. Let's analyze the given state:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

Given these conditions, let's break it down:

1. `low` is 0.
2. `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, both of which are at least 1 (since 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9).

Since `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, `high` will always be at least 1. Therefore, `low` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `high` (which is at least 1).

Thus, the condition `low <= high` is always true with the given state, and no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
