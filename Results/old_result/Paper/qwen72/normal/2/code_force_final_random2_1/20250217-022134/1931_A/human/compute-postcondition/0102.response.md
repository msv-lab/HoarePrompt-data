Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list if `lex` > 78, otherwise `arr` is [26]. `lex` is the input integer if `lex` > 78, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26` and is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52. `info` is updated to include the new list `arr` appended to its existing value.***
