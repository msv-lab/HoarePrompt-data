Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `q`) remain unchanged. The list `b` now holds the first half of the elements from `a`.
