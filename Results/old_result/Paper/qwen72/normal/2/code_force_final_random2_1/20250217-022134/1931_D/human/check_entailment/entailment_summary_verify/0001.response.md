### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` for a pair to be beautiful.
   - If the required remainders are already in the frequency dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of those remainders.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
     - `freq` dictionary to store the frequency of remainder pairs.
     - `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - **Iterate through the array:**
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each element.
     - Calculate `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.
     - Check if the required remainders are in the frequency dictionary and update `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current remainders.
   - **Output:**
     - Append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the required remainders and counts the pairs that meet the conditions.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the solution should work within the given limits.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Calculation of Remainders:**
  - The calculation of `mod_x` and `mod_y` is correct.
  - The calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is also correct:
    - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that the sum \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
    - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that the difference \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

- **Frequency Dictionary Usage:**
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the number of times a particular pair of remainders has been encountered.
  - This allows for efficient counting of beautiful pairs without needing to check every possible pair explicitly.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function processes multiple test cases correctly by iterating over `test_cases` and applying the same logic to each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as small arrays and large values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The algorithm is efficient and handles the given constraints appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
