The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case consists of:
  - A list of three integers `[n, x, y]` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`.
  - A list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` represents the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary for each test case. The `freq` dictionary contains counts of how many times each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` appears in the list `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` from the remainders of the numbers in the list `a` when divided by `x` and `y`. It returns a list `results` containing the `beautiful_count` for each test case.**
