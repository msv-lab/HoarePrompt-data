Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` is equal to `r`. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= 2 * a[l]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 1, and `sunks` is 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `sunks` is 2, and `a[r]` is 0. If `k < 2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < 2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, then `sunks` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` is equal to `r`.***
