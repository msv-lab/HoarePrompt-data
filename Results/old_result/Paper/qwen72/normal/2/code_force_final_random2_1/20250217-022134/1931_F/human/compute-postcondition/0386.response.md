Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`, and a set of `k` lists of integers. For each test case, it determines whether the order of participants shown to each participant (as represented by the lists) can be rearranged to meet certain conditions. Specifically, it checks if the lists can be adjusted so that the order of participants is consistent across all participants. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function reads input from standard input and prints the results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding 'yes' or 'no' results have been printed. **
