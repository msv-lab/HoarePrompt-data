Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements) in the order they were popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing its last `k` elements, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `combined` is not empty.**
