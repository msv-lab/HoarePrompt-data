Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `q` is 0, `a` is updated to a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers with specific ranges, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`.
- After executing this code, the variable `a` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The new list `a` will contain integers as specified in the input, but it may or may not satisfy the condition that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, depending on the input provided. However, the initial state's description of `a` remains valid as it describes the expected format of the input.
