The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. Given that `b` is 3, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. This new value is added to the current value of `ans`.

The conditions `min(n, m)` must be greater than 2 and `b` is 3 remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (n + 3) // 9`, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 2, `b` is 3.**
