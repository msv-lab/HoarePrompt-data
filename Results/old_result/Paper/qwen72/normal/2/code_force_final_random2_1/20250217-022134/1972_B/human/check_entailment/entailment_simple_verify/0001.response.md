### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice (the first player) will always have a move available when it's her turn, ensuring she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob (the second player) will always have a move available when it's his turn, ensuring he can force Alice into a losing position.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `'U'` coins in the string `s`.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge cases where there are no facing-up coins (Bob wins) and where there is only one coin (Alice wins if it's facing up).
   - The solution also correctly handles the case where there are only two coins left, as the game rules specify that one coin will be removed and the other won't be flipped.

5. **Verification with Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program before the function call is as expected: `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D".
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of `'U'` coins and returns the appropriate result based on the parity of this count.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
