To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by the new values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`.
   - Remaining elements up to `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.

3. **Variables `t`, `m`, and `u`**:
   - Set to the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - `u` is updated to `u - 2` and must evaluate to a truthy value.

4. **Comparison between `c` and `d`**:
   - If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, then `c < d`.
   - Otherwise, `c >= d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b`**:
   - The list `b` grows by `2 * (n - 3)` elements.
   - This means `b` has `2 * (n - 3)` elements added to it.

2. **Indices in `b`**:
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - These indices are valid because `d` and `c` are values returned by `r()` and are within the bounds of the list `b`.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - The values of `c` and `d` are determined by the function `r()`.
   - The comparison `c < d` or `c >= d` is given, but the exact values are not specified.

4. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` calculates the difference between the elements at the specified indices in the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the exact numerical values of `c` and `d` are not provided, but we know they are valid indices for the list `b`. The `print` statement will output the difference between the elements at these indices.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list b, and c and d are the values returned by r())**
