Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings to be formed, and `k` is an integer representing the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used. Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676), where each test case provides a pair of `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input split by space, both converted to integers. `s` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'.**
