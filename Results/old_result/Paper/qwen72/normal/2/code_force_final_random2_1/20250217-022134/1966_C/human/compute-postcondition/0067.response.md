Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is.***
