Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list until the list is empty.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- **`numCases`**: Remains greater than 2.
- **`i`**: Remains 2.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`numbers`**: Initially a sorted list of strings representing the input values, but after the loop completes, it is empty because all elements have been popped out.
- **`suma`**: Initially 0, but after the loop completes, it is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the original `numbers` list. This means that for every two integers `a` and `b` removed from the list, the smaller of the two (`min(a, b)`) is added to `suma`. The loop continues until the `numbers` list is empty.
