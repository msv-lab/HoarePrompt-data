Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the integers read from input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` `n-1` times, `adj[b]` now includes `a` `n-1` times, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The code snippet `numCuts = 0` reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0, which was already its initial value. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the program, and all other variables retain their initial values.
