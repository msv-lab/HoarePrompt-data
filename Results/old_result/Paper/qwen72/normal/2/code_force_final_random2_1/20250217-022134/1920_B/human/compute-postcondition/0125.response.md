The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a` of integers. Here, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of elements in the array.
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove from the array.
- `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
- `a` is an array of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) containing `n` elements.

The function processes each test case and returns the modified array after Alice has removed up to `k` elements and Bob has multiplied up to `x` elements by -1. The exact output for each test case is not specified in the problem statement, but it involves these operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array `a` of integers. It processes each test case by allowing Alice to remove up to `k` elements and Bob to multiply up to `x` elements by -1, and returns the modified array for each test case.**
