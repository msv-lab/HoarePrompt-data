The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts input through some mechanism (e.g., standard input, file, or another method) that provides the following:

- An integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, indicating the size of the grid.
- A grid of size `n x n` represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), with the constraint that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

The function processes each test case and determines whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of '0's and '1's. It returns the type of shape (triangle or square) formed by the '1's in the grid for each test case.**
