The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by converting the first and second elements of the list `l1` to integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already the integer value of the first element in `l1` and `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, this code does not change the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that `n` and `k` are now explicitly set to the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.**
