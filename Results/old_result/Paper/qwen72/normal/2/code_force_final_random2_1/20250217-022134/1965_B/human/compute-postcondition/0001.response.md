The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and the input to the loop must be a positive integer. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values provided by the user, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer.**
