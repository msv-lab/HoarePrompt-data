Initial State: - The only variable that changes is `oneInd`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Affected Variables:**
   - The variable `ans[i]` is being assigned a new value.
   - The expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` is used to compute the new value of `ans[i]`.

2. **Check Previous Values:**
   - `zeroInd` remains unchanged.
   - `oneInd` is the only variable that changes.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.

3. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The new value of `ans[i]` is computed as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `oneInd` has changed, all other variables remain unchanged.**
