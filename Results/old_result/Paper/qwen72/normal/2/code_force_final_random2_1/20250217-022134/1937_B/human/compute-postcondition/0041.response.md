Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the concatenated string formed by the condition being met (if it was met) or the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations plus 2, and `t` is 1. If the first two characters of `a[0]` match the first two characters of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
