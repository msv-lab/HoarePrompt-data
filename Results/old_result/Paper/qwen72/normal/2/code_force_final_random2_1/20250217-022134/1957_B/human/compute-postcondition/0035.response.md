Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `n`, `k`, or any other variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).***
