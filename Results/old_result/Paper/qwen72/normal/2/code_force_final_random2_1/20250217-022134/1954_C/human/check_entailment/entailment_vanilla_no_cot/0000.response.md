Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The logic in the function `func_1` only swaps digits once when it finds a pair where `a[i] < b[i]`, and then it continues to swap digits where `a[i] > b[i]` without considering the overall impact on the product. This approach does not guarantee that the final values of `x` and `y` will yield the maximum possible product.

To maximize the product, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as sorting the digits in a way that maximizes the product of the two numbers. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.
