Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.
2. `n` is `r[0]`.
3. `m` is `r[1]`.
4. `x1` is `x_a + a`.
5. `y1` is `r[3]`.
6. `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
7. `y2` is `r[5]`.
8. `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
9. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
10. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
11. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
12. `b` is `x2 - x1`.
13. Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `x2` is greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- The condition `b` is `x2 - x1` confirms that `b` is an even number.
- The condition `y1` is not equal to `y2` means that `t` (which is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`) is a positive non-zero integer.
- The condition `either x2 is less than or equal to x1, or x1 is less than 1, or x2 is greater than n` must be true. Given that `x2` is greater than `x1`, the only possible conditions are `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print('draw')` statement will simply print the string `'draw'`.
- The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
