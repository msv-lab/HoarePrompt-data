The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `ans` initially contains the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.
- `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.

After executing the code, `ans` will contain two elements: the initial value and the value of `sums`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1]`.**
