#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes. k_1, k_2, ..., k_n are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is the number of iterations for the last test case, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case, `prod` is the product of all original elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` for the last test case. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for any test case, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output for each test case is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all elements in the updated `a` list from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `bets` (number of outcomes) and a list of integers `a` (multipliers). It calculates the product of all elements in `a` and then updates each element to the product divided by itself. It sums the updated elements and compares this sum to the original product. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the updated list of elements as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the processed results for each test case.
