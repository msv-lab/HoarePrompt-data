Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input string that must have at least one element, `n` is greater than `len(s)`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes`. `cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1, and `c` is the first element in the list `s`.***
