Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The `flag` will be 0 or 1 depending on the last condition met during the loop execution. Specifically, any consecutive '1's in `s` will have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 will have been left unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
