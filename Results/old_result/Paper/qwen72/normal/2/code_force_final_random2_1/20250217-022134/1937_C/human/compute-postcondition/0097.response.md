Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `I` and `R` are defined, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `i` is 2, `prev` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `prev`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
