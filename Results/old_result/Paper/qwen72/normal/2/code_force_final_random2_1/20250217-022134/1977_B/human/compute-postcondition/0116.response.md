Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and each power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^29. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', `flag` is set to 1, and `s[1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0, and `s` remains unchanged.***
