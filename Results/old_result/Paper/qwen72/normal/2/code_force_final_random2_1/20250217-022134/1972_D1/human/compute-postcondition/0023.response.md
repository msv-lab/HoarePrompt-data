Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` reassigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]`, respectively.
- Since `info[0]` and `info[1]` are already described as being the integer values of `a` and `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they were initially.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables.
