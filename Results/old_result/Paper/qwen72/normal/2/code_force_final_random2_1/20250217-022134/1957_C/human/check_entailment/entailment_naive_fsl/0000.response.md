Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the initial moves (r, c) and (c, r) are already occupied by rooks placed in previous moves. This can lead to incorrect results because the program assumes that the positions (r, c) and (c, r) are always available for the computer's mirrored move unless r == c.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
Here, the first move is (1, 2) and the second move is (2, 1). According to the problem description, the computer will mirror the first move by placing a rook at (2, 1), but this position is already occupied by the second move. The program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly calculate the number of possible final configurations.

This is a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
