The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, and an array `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases, denoted as `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.**
