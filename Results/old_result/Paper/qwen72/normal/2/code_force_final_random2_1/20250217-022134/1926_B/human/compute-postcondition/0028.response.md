Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
   - At least one input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1', so `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
   - If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `a` is explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE' because the initial state mentions that at least one input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1'.
   - The value of `b` is not relevant to the `print(a)` statement, so we don't need to consider it further.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`, which is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
