The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the state of the variables remains unchanged. However, the program control moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains valid `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described, and `cases` must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. Additionally, the length of the set `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. The program control moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
