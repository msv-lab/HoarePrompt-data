Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case` where each element is a digit-only substring converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of times the loop has executed, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, `median` is the final value of `b[ma]` plus 1, `new_median` is the final value of `b[ma]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
- Each iteration increments the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` by 1 and increments the operation counter `op` by 1.
- After each increment, the list `b` is sorted again to ensure it remains in ascending order.
- The loop will stop when `new_median` (which is the value at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`) becomes greater than `median`.
- Therefore, the final state of the loop will have `op` equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `b[ma]` incremented by the same number of times, and `new_median` will be the final value of `b[ma]` which is one more than `median`.
