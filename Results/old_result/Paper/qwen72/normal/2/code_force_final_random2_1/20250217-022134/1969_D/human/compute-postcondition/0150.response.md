Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` now contains the second-to-last element of `combined` if `combined` had at least two elements (or remains an empty list if `combined` had fewer than two elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing its last two elements (two less elements than before), `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains an empty list, and `combined` remains unchanged.***
