Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If at least one input string `s` during the loop contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string `s` during the loop contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` remains 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1' character, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains as an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means the input string `s` contained exactly one '1'. If `a` is 0, it means the input string `s` did not contain exactly one '1'. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
