The function `func_2()` is called, but since no return value from `func_2()` is assigned to any variable, the call itself does not change the state of any variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 2`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`.**
