Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, `k` is now `k - (a[l] * 2)`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 1` or `n - 2` to `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
