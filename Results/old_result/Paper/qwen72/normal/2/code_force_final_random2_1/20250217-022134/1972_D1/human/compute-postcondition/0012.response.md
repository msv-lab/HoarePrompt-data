Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\) which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.
