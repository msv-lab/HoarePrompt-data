Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an input integer, `u_1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers provided by user input. If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, and `empty` is False. If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque, and `empty` remains False. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u` at the leftmost position. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the integer `u`. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[v]` and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Additionally, if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `u` is equal to `v`.***
