You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers where start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files, `t` is the original input value, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the last input string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program prints 'YES'. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and either odd or 1, the program prints 'NO'. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or `cnt1` is even and not 1, and if '11' is in `s`, the program prints 'NO'. If '11' is not in `s`, the program prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: Processes a range of subfolders (from `start` to `end`) within the current directory, where each subfolder may contain `.html` files. The function does not return any value but performs operations on the specified subfolders.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
