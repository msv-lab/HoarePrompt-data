t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a tuple containing three elements: n, m, and k, where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, respectively, and k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)) representing the number of elements to be chosen. Additionally, each test case includes two lists of integers, a and b, of lengths n and m, respectively, where each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6).
