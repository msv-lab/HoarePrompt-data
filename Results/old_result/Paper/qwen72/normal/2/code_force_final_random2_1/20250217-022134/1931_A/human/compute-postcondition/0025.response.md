The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Based on the initial state, the value of `arr` before this operation depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` < 28, `arr` is [1].
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` is [26].
- If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` is either an empty list (if `lex` > 78) or [26].

After appending 26 to `arr`, the updated values of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` < 28, `arr` becomes [1, 26].
- If 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26].
- If `lex` ≥ 52, `arr` becomes [26] if `lex` > 78, or [26, 26] if 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.

The other variables (`n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is unchanged, and `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` < 28, [26, 26] if 28 ≤ `lex` < 52, and [26] if `lex` > 78 or [26, 26] if 52 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
