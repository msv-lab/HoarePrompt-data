The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` adds the value `k + 1` to the end of the list `nums`. This impacts the list `nums` and potentially the indices `idx` and `i` if they depend on the contents of `nums`.

- The list `nums` originally contains the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx]]`.
- After appending `k + 1`, the new list `nums` will be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1]`.

The indices `idx` and `i` might be affected if they depend on the new value `k + 1` being added to the list:

- `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists. Since `k + 1` is greater than `k`, it does not affect `idx`.
- `i` is the index of the first number in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` if no such number exists. Since `k + 1` is greater than `k`, `i` will now point to the index of `k + 1` in the list.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1]`
- `idx` remains the same (index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists)
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1]`, `idx` is the index of the largest number in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such number exists, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in the updated list `nums`.**
