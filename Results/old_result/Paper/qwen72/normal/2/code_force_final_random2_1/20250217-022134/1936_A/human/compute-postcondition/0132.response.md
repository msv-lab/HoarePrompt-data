Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` is 0. `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `pans` contains all integers `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer has been flushed.***
