Output State: **`n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` has the same `n` elements but in reverse order, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `result` remain unchanged.
