Postcondition: ***`a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either an empty list or "abc10jkl", `x` is 0 or 2, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is the concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the characters from index `i` onwards of `a[1]`, `x` is 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `s`, `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.***
