### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball placed on a cell will move left or right based on the direction of the cell.
   - The direction of the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific index.
     - It is used to compute the positions of the pinball as it moves through the grid.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the positions and calculating the time for each starting position.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is initialized with the indices of cells containing `>`.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single `0`.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - For each cell from the end to the beginning:
       - If the cell contains `>`, it updates the `ans` list based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the cell contains `<`, it updates the `suffZero` list and recalculates the `ans` list.

   - **Output:**
     - The final result is printed as a space-separated list of times.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the inversion of the direction after each move.
   - The use of cumulative sums and differences ensures efficient computation of the required times.
   - The logic for handling both `>` and `<` directions is consistent with the problem description.
