The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, which means `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`.

Therefore, the value of `b[1]` (which is the same as `b[0]`) is appended to `ans1`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `len(l)` is 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` (which is the same as `b[0]`).**
