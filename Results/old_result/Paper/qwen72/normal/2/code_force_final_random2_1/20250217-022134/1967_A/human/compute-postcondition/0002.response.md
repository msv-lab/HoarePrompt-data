The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `ii` is 0
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is an integer greater than 0

After executing the code, the variable `a` will contain a list of integers input by the user. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
