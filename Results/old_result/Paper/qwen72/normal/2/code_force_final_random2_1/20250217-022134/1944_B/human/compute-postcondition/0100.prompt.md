Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n` (indicating the loop has completed its full range), `k` will be `req - 2 * m` where `m` is the number of times a consecutive duplicate was found, and `ans2` will contain the elements from `c` that were consecutive duplicates, each appended twice. The values of `n`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the length of `l`, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `l`, `ans2` now contains the first element of `l`, `k` is `k - 1`. If `k` was 1 before the decrement, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the length of `l`, `ans1` is a list containing the first two elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first and second elements of `l`, `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the length of `l`, `ans1` is a list containing the first three elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `k` is `k - 3`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
