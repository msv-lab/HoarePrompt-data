To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from user input.
   - `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `x` is the last integer in the list `l`.
   - `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from user input.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l` minus the cumulative sum up to the (a-2)-th element in the list `l`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum up to the (b-1)-th element in the list `l`.
   - The current value of `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
   - The current value of `s` is at least twice the value of `b - a + 1`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and do not contradict each other, the `print('YES')` statement will indeed print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
