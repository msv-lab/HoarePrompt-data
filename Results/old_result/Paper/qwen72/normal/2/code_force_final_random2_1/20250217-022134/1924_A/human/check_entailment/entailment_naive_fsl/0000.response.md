Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the generation of all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checking if they occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not generate all possible combinations of strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`.

A specific case where the program fails is:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
bb
```

The program incorrectly outputs `No` and provides a string `bb` that it claims does not occur as a subsequence in `abba`, but `bb` is indeed a subsequence of `abba`. This indicates that the program's logic for generating and checking subsequences is flawed.
