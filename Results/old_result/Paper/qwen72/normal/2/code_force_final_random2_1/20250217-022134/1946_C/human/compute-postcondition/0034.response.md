The code snippet `L = x` updates the value of `L` to the current value of `x`. Based on the initial state, `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given the conditions:

- If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, then `x` is 75001.
- If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, then `x` is 25001.

Therefore, the value of `L` will be updated to the value of `x` based on these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, the loop has executed `n - 1` times, `i` is `n - 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R` remains unchanged, and `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 100001, then `L` is now 75001. If `L` was 1 and `R` was 50001, then `L` is now 25001.**
