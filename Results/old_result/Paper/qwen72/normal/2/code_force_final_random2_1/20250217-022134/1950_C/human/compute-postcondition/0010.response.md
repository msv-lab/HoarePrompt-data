Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input as an integer, `h` is now `h - 12`, and the current value of `h` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `day` is updated from 'AM' to 'PM'.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `_`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `h` is the hour part of the input as an integer and is now `h - 12` with the current value of `h` being greater than 0 remains valid.
