The provided Python code snippet contains nested loops that iterate over certain ranges and perform a condition check. However, the code does not modify any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`). It only prints pairs of `i` and `j` that satisfy a specific condition.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- The outer loop iterates `i` from 1 to `a`.
- The inner loop iterates `j` from 4 to `b`.
- For each pair `(i, j)`, the condition `int((j+i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j))) == 0` is checked.
- If the condition is true, the pair `(i, j)` is printed.

Since the code only prints and does not modify any variables, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
