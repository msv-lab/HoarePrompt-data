Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 2. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, the first element of `s` is either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`. In all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
