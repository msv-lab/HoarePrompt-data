Postcondition: ***`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0, and `val` is the next element in `a`. If the new value of `op` is `False`, `t` is a list that now includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `a` must have at least one more element.***
