Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `num` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `b[ma]` is incremented by the number of iterations required for `new_median` to exceed `median`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any increments, `new_median` is equal to `median + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `b[ma]` and `op` until `new_median` exceeds `median`.
- After each iteration, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, and `op` is incremented by 1.
- The loop stops when `new_median` becomes `median + 1`.
- Therefore, the final state of `b[ma]` will be `median + 1`, and `op` will be the number of iterations it took to reach this state.
