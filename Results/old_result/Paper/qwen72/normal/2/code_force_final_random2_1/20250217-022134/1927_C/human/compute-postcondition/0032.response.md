Output State: **All the initial state conditions remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next line of code.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain valid and unchanged. The program simply moves on to the next line of code.
