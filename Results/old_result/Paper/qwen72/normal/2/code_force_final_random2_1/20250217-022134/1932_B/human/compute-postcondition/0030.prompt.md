Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, `results` must contain at least three elements, `result` is the third element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
