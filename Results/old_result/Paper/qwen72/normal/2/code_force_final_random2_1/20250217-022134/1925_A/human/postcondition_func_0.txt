The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the length of the desired string and `k` represents the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used. The function then returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times. The function does not handle multiple test cases; it processes only one set of `n` and `k` values per call.
