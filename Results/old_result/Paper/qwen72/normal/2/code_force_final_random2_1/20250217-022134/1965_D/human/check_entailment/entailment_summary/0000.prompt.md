Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array (with a length between 3 and 1000). It calculates all possible cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting from each index to the end of the list, and returns a sorted list `cts` containing these cumulative sums. The original list `a` remains unchanged.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array. It processes this list to remove consecutive duplicate elements, returning a new list `odds` that contains only the unique elements from `cts` that do not form pairs of consecutive identical elements. After the function concludes, the original list `cts` remains unchanged, and the returned list `odds` reflects the filtered elements as described.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums, and `n`, a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) indicating the length of the array `a` to be recovered. The function reconstructs and returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the values in `a` are derived from the elements of `odds`. The list `odds` remains unchanged. After the function executes, the list `a` will contain the appropriate values based on the elements of `odds`, and the original list `odds` will be unmodified.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a sublist of `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing their last elements as long as they are equal and `smallList` is not empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList` after this process. If `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, the function stops removing elements and returns the last element of `bigList`.
