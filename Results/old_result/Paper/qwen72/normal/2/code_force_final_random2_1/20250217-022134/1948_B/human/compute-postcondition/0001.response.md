The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is typically used when the value from the iterable is not needed. Before the loop starts, the state of `n` must be such that it allows the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
