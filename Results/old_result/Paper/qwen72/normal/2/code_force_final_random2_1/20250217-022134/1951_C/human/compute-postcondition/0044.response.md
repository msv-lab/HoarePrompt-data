Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is the initial value of `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + sum(l[j] * s - s * s / 2 for j in range(n))`, and the list `l` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.**
