Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 unique integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 2 unique integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1, where `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has been fully iterated over, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 3 unique integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If the third unique integer in `pl` (denoted as `j`) appears at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
