The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. Since `line` is the first line of input data for the first test case, `elements` will contain the substrings from this line.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- The input file has at least three lines
- `line` is the first line of input data for the first test case

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `t` is at least 1
- The input file has at least three lines
- `line` is the first line of input data for the first test case
- `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, the input file has at least three lines, `line` is the first line of input data for the first test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.**
