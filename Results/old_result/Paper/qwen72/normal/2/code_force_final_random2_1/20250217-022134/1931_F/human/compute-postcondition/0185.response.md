Postcondition: ***`l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the same conditions apply as before. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
