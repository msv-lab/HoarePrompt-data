Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The main issue lies in the logic used within `func_1` to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \). The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the pairs `(x, y)` should be considered where `x` and `y` are relatively prime (i.e., `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`). However, this assumption is not aligned with the problem's requirement.

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Incorrect Pair Generation**: The program generates pairs `(x, y)` and checks if they are relatively prime. This is not the correct approach because the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` where \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \).

2. **Condition Check**: The condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \) is not correctly implemented. The program should check if \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \% (a + b) == 0 \) for each pair `(a, b)`.

3. **Efficiency**: The current nested loops and the way pairs are generated and checked are inefficient and may not handle large inputs within the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute \( \gcd(a, b) \).
3. Check if \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \% (a + b) == 0 \).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition correctly. However, it may still be inefficient for large inputs. For better performance, consider optimizing the pair generation and condition checking using more advanced techniques or data structures.
