Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 2) and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x + 1]`).
- Therefore, the new value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
