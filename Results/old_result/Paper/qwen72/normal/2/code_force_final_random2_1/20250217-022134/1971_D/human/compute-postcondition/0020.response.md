Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string with a length greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 3, `j` is 1, and `flag` is either True or False depending on the initial conditions. If `s[j]` (which is `s[1]`) is not equal to `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[2]`), and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is updated to 2 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, `j` remains 1 and `flag` retains its initial value.***
