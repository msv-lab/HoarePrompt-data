The last element of `bigList` is removed by the `pop()` method. Since the last element of `bigList` was equal to the last element of `smallList`, after removing this element from `bigList`, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer necessarily the same. However, `smallList` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a non-empty sublist of `bigList` (unchanged), and the last element of `bigList` may no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.**
