Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `=` or `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. Additionally, the user input is `<`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to 1, as `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
