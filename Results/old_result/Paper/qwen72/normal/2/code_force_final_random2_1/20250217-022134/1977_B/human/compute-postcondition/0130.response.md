Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each element in `s` is either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s` remains unchanged and `flag` remains 1. In all other cases, `flag` remains 0, and `s` remains unchanged.***
