### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(ch):** This function checks if a string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - The function correctly identifies palindromes.
   - **func_2(ch):** This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition the string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts.
     - The function's logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic in all cases.

3. **Evaluating the Main Logic:**
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes variables and checks if the string is a repeated character (e.g., "lllllll").
   - If the string is a repeated character, it sets `T1` to `False`, indicating that no valid partition exists.
   - If `T1` is still `True` and the string is a palindrome, it calls `func_2` to determine the number of parts.
   - Depending on the value returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string.
   - The partitioning logic is complex and has several issues:
     - It does not always ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic.
     - It does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when the string is very short or has specific patterns.

4. **Specific Issues:**
   - **Edge Case Handling:** The program does not handle edge cases well, such as very short strings or strings with specific patterns.
   - **Partitioning Logic:** The partitioning logic in the main loop is overly complex and does not always produce the correct result.
   - **Output Format:** The program does not always provide the correct output format, especially when the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.
   - It lacks the necessary logic to ensure that the resulting parts are non-palindromic and does not provide the actual partition of the string in all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
