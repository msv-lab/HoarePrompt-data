The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of other variables, but it changes the order of elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting with `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and updating based on the conditions within the loop.**
