The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value at index `b - 1` of the list `p` to the variable `s`. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers greater than 0.
- `l` remains a list of integers derived from user input.
- `p` remains a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` remains equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- `x` remains the last integer in the list `l`.
- `_` remains a throwaway variable.
- `m` remains one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `a` and `b` remain integers read from user input.
- `s` is now equal to the value at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.**
