The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the implicit length of the range, which is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented to 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is now a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`, `j` is 1**
