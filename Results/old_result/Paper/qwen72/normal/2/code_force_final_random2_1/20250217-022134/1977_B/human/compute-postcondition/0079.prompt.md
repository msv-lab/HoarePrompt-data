Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). The elements of `s` have been modified according to the rules specified in the loop: any consecutive '1's in `s` have been replaced with '-1' and the subsequent bit set to '0', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is set have been changed to '1'. The final value of `flag` depends on the last operation performed in the loop. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 31, the 31st element of `s` is '1', and `s[29]` is '0'. Otherwise, `length` remains 30, and `flag` is not set or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', then `s[0]` is now '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Additionally, if `s[1]` was '-1' and `s[0]` was '1', then `s[0]` is now '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except for `s[2]` and `s[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30 (or 31 if `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0'), `i` is 3, and `s` is a list containing 30 (or 31) elements where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29 or 30). If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[3]` is now '0' and `s[2]` is now '-1'. Additionally, if `s[2]` was '-1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Furthermore, if `s[1]` was '-1' and `s[0]` was '1', then `s[0]` is now '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except for `s[3]` and `s[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
