Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers derived from user input, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, and the total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` was already a list of integers derived from user input, but this code reassigns `l` with a new list of integers derived from a new user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `_`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged or their values are derived from the new `l`.
- The condition that the total number of iterations (input by the user) must be greater than the new value of `_` remains valid.
