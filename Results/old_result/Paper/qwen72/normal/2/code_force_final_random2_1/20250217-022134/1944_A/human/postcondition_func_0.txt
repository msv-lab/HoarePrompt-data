The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively. It then prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and no further actions are performed.
