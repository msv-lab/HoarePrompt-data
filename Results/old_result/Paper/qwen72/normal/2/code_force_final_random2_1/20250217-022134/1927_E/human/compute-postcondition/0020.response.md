To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is m + 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is m * k.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `k`.
- The loop condition is `i < k`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Since `i` is currently 0, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.

### New State:
- `i` is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices 0, k, 2*k, ..., (m-1)*k (where m is the largest integer such that (m-1)*k < n) are set to 1, 2, 3, ..., m respectively, and the rest of the elements are initialized with zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is m + 1; `i` is 1; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is m * k.**
