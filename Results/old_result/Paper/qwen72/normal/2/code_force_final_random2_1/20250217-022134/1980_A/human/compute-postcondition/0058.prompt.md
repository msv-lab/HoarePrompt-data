Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'F', `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`, and `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and must have at least one key-value pair, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`. The value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m` if the if condition is true. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and must have at least two key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer input by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and must have at least three key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is incremented by `(m - hmp[i])`. `s` is a new non-empty string input by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
