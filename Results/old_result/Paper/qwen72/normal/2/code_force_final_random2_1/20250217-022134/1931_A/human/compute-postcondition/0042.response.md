The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. We need to consider two cases based on the value of `lex`:

1. If `lex` < 28, then `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`. Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex]` because `1` is already the smallest value and `lex` is less than 28.
2. If 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, then `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]` where `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` a value between 0 and 26 (inclusive). Sorting this list will result in `[lex, 26, 26]`.

Let's summarize the output state for both cases:

- For `lex` < 28:
  - `arr` remains `[1, 1, lex]`.
- For 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78:
  - `arr` becomes `[lex - 52, 26, 26]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` < 28, `arr` is `[lex - 52, 26, 26]` if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78, and `lex` is reduced by 52 if 28 ≤ `lex` ≤ 78.**
