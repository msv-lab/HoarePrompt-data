The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the constant `3` (from `range(3)`), so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `3`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers, `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration, `i` is 2, `temp` is now a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[2][0] + 96`, `j` is 1**
