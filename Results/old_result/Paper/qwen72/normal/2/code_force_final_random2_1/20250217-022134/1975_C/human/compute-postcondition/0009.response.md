The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2. If the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max` (which is either 0 or the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`), then `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains as it was after the previous iteration.**
