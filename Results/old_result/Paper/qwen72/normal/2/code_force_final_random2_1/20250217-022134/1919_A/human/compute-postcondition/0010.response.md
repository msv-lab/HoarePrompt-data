To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bob')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer provided by the user input, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with the constraint \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition**:
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is checked.
   - If the absolute difference is even, the condition is true.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, the condition is false.

Given the provided code snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Bob')` statement is:

Output: **Bob**
