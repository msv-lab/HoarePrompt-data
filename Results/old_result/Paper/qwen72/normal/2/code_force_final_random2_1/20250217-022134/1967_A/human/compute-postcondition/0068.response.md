Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is the third element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, so `r` is now the third element of the sorted list `a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
