To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is 0.
- `current_profit` is 0.
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is now one element shorter, and `k` is now `k - 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head only involves the variable `k`.
- The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop head only depends on `k`, we need to adjust `k` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was decremented by 1, so it is now `k - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0.

### Updated State:
- `k` is now `k - 1` but must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, `k` must be greater than 0, and if `combined` is not empty, `combined` is now one element shorter, and `k` is now `k - 1`**.
