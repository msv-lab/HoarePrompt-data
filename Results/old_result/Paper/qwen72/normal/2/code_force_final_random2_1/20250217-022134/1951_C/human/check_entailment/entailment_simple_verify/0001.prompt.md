You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value of `n` for each test case, `m` is the same as the initial value of `m` for each test case, `k` is 0, `s` is the last computed value of `min(m, k)` before `k` becomes 0, `c` is the final computed cost which is the sum of the costs calculated for each test case, and the list `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.
   - It sorts the list `l` to ensure that the cheapest tickets are considered first.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of tickets purchased on the current day.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which seems to be an incorrect initialization. This value should be 0 because it represents the total cost of purchasing tickets.

3. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to purchase `s` as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets per day) and `k` (remaining tickets needed).
   - It subtracts `s` from `k` to update the remaining tickets needed.
   - It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day, which is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the total cost `c` as an integer.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:**
  - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0 because it represents the total cost of purchasing tickets.
  - This incorrect initialization will lead to an incorrect final cost.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is also incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
  - The correct cost calculation should be `c += l[i] * s`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        print(c)
```
