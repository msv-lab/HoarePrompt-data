Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` sets the value of `idx` to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged. The condition for `idx` being set to 0 and breaking the loop is not relevant here because the code snippet only updates `idx` to `i - 1`.
