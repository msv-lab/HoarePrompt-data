Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 0, `b` is either 0 or the value of `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` for the first such `y`, `y` is the index where the condition was first met or `n-1` if never met, `x` starts from `y + 1`, and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and the difference between the new `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `(a - l[x]) > (b - l[x])`.***
