Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input line, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0. If the second element of `l` (i.e., `l[1]`) is greater than the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`), then `b` is set to `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
