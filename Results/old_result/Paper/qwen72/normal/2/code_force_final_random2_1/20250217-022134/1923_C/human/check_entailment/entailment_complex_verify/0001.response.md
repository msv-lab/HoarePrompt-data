### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This is achieved through the loop:
     ```python
     c = 0
     for x in l:
         c += x
         p.append(c)
     ```
   - This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the prefix sums.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the indices `a` and `b` and computes the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sums:
     ```python
     s = p[b - 1]
     if a - 2 >= 0:
         s -= p[a - 2]
     ```
   - This calculation is correct because it correctly handles the edge case where `a` is 1 (i.e., the subarray starts from the beginning of the array).

3. **Good Subarray Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).
   - These conditions are derived from the problem statement:
     - The sum of the subarray must equal the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`.
     - Each element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `c` and must be greater than 0.
     - Therefore, the minimum possible sum of `b` is `2 * (b - a + 1)` (each element in `b` being at least 1 more than the corresponding element in `c`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element. In such cases, it will always print "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition that `a_i \neq b_i` for every index `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
