To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `a` will be the last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop (either being the greatest or the smallest depending on the conditions).
- `b` will be the second-to-last element of `l` that meets the conditions specified in the loop.
- `c` will be the count of how many times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution.
- The value of `x` will be `n`.
- `y` will remain the index where the initial condition `l[y] > l[y-1]` was first met or `n-1` if never met.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- The key variable here is `c`, which counts the number of times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution.
- Since `a` and `b` are the last and second-to-last elements of `l` that meet certain conditions, and `c` is counting the number of times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` will be a non-negative integer representing this count.

### Output:
The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of how many times `l[x]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution.

Output: **c (where c is the count of how many times l[x] was greater than both a and b during the loop's execution)**
