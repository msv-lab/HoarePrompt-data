Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`, and `curr` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is 0**: After all iterations, `n` is reduced to 0 because the loop continues to subtract multiples of the elements in `costs` from `n` until `n` becomes 0.
- **`k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18**: The value of `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n` is not equal to `k`**: Since `n` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, `n` will never be equal to `k`.
- **`n` is less than `k`**: Since `n` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, `n` is always less than `k`.
- **`costs` is a list containing two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`**: The list `costs` is modified as `n` changes, but ultimately, when `n` is 0, the first element of `costs` becomes `1 - k` and the second element remains 1.
- **`h` is the sum of the initial value of `n` divided by each element in `costs`**: The variable `h` accumulates the sum of `n` divided by each element in `costs` during each iteration of the loop.
- **`curr` is 0**: After the last iteration, `curr` is 0 because `n` is 0 and `n // i` for any positive `i` is 0.
