To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
   - If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Additionally, `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `check_all_new` is `True`.
   - `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute because both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
