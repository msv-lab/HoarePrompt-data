### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the input values `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` without a remainder (`x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient.
   - It checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that the GCD is maximized.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the given divisor.
   - The final result `ans` is the maximum GCD that can be achieved under the given constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 1` and `n = 1`, the GCD is 1, which is correctly handled.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only way to split is into 1s, so the GCD is 1, which is correctly handled.
   - For larger values of `x` and `n`, the algorithm efficiently finds the maximum GCD by checking divisors up to the square root of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
