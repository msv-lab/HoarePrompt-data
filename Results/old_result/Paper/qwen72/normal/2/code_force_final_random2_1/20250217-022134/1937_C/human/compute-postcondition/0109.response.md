The `sys.stdout.flush()` command flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is immediately written to the terminal or output device. Since the initial state already indicates that the output buffer has been flushed, executing this command again does not change any of the variables or the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the final user input, and `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.**
