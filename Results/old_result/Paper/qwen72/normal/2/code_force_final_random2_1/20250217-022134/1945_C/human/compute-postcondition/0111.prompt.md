Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is the integer value of `(o * 100) // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0 and has a length of 1. Otherwise, `final` now includes `n` and has a length of 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character, rounded up, which is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is the percentage of remaining '1's in the string, rounded up, which is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is the integer value of `(o * 100) // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0 and has a length of 1. Otherwise, `final` now includes `n` and has a length of 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `i` is incremented by 1, `lst` contains the element 1, and the conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is a new input integer greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is even or the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 2))`, and `lst` contains the element 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `i` is updated to 2 and `lst` contains the elements [1, 2].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 3))`, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `lst`) retain their initial values. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes the value `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
