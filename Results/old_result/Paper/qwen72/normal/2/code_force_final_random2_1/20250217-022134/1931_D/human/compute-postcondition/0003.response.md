Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each containing two lines: the first line with three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and the second line with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the list of `n` integers from the current test case.**
