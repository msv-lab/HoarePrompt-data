Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` are specific integers provided by the user input (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition is true. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the condition is false.***
