The value of `tot` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement when `num[i]` is not '0' does not affect the current state since the code snippet only increments `tot`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 10^9, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. If `num[i]` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as is.**
