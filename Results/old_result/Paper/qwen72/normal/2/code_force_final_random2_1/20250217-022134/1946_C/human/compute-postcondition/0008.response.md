The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n - 1` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers read from the input, respectively, and `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `a`.**
