Output State: **`zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

### Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that the only variable that changes is `zeroInd`.
- The calculation for `zeroInd` is given as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The specific values or expressions for these variables are not altered by the code snippet provided.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `zeroInd` while maintaining the initial state of all other variables.
