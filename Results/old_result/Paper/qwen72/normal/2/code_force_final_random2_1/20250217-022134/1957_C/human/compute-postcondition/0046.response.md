Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user minus 2, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num` which simplifies to `m` is `n`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the conditions remain unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.
