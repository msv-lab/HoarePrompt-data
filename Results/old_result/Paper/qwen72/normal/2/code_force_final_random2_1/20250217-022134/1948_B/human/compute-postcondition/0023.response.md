The code snippet assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the other variables, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`.**
