Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing.
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
