The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `bets` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is `a[0] * a[1]`, `i` is 2**
