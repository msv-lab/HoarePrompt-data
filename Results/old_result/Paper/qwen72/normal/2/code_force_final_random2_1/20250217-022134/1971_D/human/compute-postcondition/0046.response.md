Postcondition: ***`s` is the new input string with `len(s)` greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, then `count` is updated to 2. Additionally, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', then `j` is updated to 1 and `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, the values of `j` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
