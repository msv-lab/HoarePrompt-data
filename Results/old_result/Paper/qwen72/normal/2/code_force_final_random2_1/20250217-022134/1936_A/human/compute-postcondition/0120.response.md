Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, the output buffer has been flushed, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `pans` is `[1]`, if `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`, otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is now 2, and the rest of the initial state remains the same.
