Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input positive integer, `k` is the second input positive integer, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (before appending) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power of 2 exists, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` (before appending) that is greater than `k`, or the length of `nums` (before appending) if no such element exists.**
