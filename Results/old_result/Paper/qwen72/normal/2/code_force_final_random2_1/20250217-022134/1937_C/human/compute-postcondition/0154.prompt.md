You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates within an interactive environment where the input is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the goal is to find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function does not take any direct input parameters but interacts with the environment through queries and receives responses based on the bitwise OR comparisons. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: After the loop completes all iterations, `I` and `R` remain defined, `kp` is equal to the initial value of `int(input())` minus 1, `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '<' in the first inner loop, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the comparison `r` was '>' in the second inner loop, or 0 if no such `i` exists, and the output buffer has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates within an interactive environment and does not take any direct input parameters. It finds two indices i and j in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the result of p_i ⊕ p_j (bitwise XOR) is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function returns the two indices i and j.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
