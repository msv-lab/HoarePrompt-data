Output State: **`l22` remains a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations plus 2, `n` is greater than the number of iterations, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx2 = n - 2` updates the value of `idx2` to `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update while maintaining the initial conditions.
