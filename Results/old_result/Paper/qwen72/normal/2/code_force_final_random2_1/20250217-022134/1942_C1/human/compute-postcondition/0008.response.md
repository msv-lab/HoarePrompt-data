Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`, and the current value of `num` is 1.**
