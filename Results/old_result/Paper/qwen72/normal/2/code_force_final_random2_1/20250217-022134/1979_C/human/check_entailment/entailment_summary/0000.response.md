Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then distributing the bets such that each bet is equal to the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. This approach ensures that the return from any winning outcome is the product, which is a common value across all outcomes. However, the sum of all bets should be strictly less than the product for the solution to be valid.

Let's break down the logic and correctness:

1. **Product Calculation**: The product of all multipliers is calculated. This step is necessary because the goal is to find a set of bets where the return from any winning outcome is the same and greater than the total bet.

2. **Bet Distribution**: Each bet is set to the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the return from any winning outcome is the product.

3. **Sum Check**: The sum of all bets is compared to the product. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it means there is no valid distribution of bets that satisfies the condition, and the function prints `-1`.

4. **Output**: If the sum is less than the product, the function prints the bets as a space-separated string.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- **Sum Check Flaw**: The sum of the bets should be strictly less than the product, but the program checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. This is incorrect because even if the sum is equal to the product, the condition is not satisfied, and the program should still print `-1`.

To fix this, the comparison should be `if sumo >= prod:` instead of `if sumo > prod:`.

Given the current implementation, the program will incorrectly print `-1` in some cases where a valid solution exists.

Correctness: **False**
