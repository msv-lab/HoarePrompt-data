Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` and `a1` are input integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `m - 2` inputs have been consumed. `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Alternatively, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.**
