Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose bit at position 29 is 0. If `u` and `v` are both 0, the variables retain their updated values as described above.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the first element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0 and `t` is a list containing the value `ai ^ val`. Otherwise, `op` is not 0 and `ai` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least one element; `val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`; `ai` is `ai` XOR `val`; if `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list containing the value `val`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. If `op` is 0 after the update, `ai` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements; `val` is the third element of `a`. If `op` is 0, `ai` is set to 0, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list that includes the new value `ai` (which is 0). Otherwise, `op` remains unchanged and `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
