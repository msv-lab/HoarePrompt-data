To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
   - `cases` must be greater than 1.
   - `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist being a sorted list of three integers.
   - `lex` is the remaining value after the last iteration.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is constructed from the elements of the sublist `info[2]`.
   - Each element in `info[2]` is incremented by 96 and then converted to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - For example, if `info[2]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then:
     - `info[2][0] + 96` = 1 + 96 = 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'.
     - `info[2][1] + 96` = 2 + 96 = 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'.
     - `info[2][2] + 96` = 3 + 96 = 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.
   - Therefore, `temp` would be the string `'abc'`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - Since `temp` is constructed from the elements of `info[2]` and each element is converted to its corresponding ASCII character, the output will be a string of three characters derived from the elements of `info[2]`.

Given the initial state, the `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp` which is constructed from the elements of `info[2]` as described.

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by converting the elements of info[2] to their corresponding ASCII characters)**

For example, if `info[2]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:
Output: **abc**
