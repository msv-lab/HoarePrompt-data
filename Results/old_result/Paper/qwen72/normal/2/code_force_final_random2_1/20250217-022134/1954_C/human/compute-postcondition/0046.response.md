Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `a` is a list of characters with no elements remaining to be processed
- `b` must have at least 1 element

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Since `a` has no elements remaining to be processed, it is an empty list: `a = []`.
   - Therefore, `len(a) = 0`.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `len(a) - 1`.
   - Given `len(a) = 0`, we have `i = 0 - 1 = -1`.

3. **List `b`**:
   - `b` must have at least 1 element. Let's denote the elements of `b` as `b[0], b[1], ...`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[i], end='')`.
   - Since `i = -1`, the statement is trying to access the last element of the list `b`.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement will print the last element of the list `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[-1] (where b[-1] is the last element of the list b)**
