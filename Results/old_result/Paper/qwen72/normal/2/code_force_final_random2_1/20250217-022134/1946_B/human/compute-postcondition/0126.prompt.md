You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a and the number of operations, respectively. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a. The sum of the values of n and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        s = sum(a)
        
        t, tmp = 0, 0
        
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `T` is an integer read from the standard input, 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `_` is `T-1`; `n` and `k` are integers read from the last line of standard input with `k` > 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the last line of standard input and must have `n` elements; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `((2 * (the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays in `a`)) % MOD) * (2^(k-1)) % MOD`; `i` is `0`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (t * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD) % MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of an array a, and an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of operations. The array a contains n integers (each between -10^9 and 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns the result of the operations performed on the array a for each test case. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
