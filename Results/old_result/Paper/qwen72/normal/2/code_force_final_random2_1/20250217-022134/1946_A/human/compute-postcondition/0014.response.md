Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res = a.count(a[p])` updates the value of `res` to the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new value of `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.
