### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` iterates over `b` only, but the problem requires iterating over both `a` and `b`. This means the program is not considering all possible pairs `(a, b)` as required by the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:` do not correctly reflect the required condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula used in the program does not match the mathematical condition specified in the problem.

3. **Subtraction of 1**:
   - The final `print(suma - 1)` is arbitrary and does not have a clear justification in the context of the problem. It seems to be an attempt to adjust the result, but it is not based on any logical reasoning related to the problem's requirements.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `(2, 3)`:
- The valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`.
- The program's output for this test case is incorrect because it does not correctly count these pairs.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition for each pair. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment accurately identified the issues with the provided program. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
