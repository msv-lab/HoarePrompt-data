The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first element of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'L', or the last element of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.**
