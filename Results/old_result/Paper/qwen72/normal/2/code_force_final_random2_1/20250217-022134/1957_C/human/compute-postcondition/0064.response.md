Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `k-1` (which is -1), `num` is the total increment based on the inputs `c` and `r` over all iterations. For each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` was incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, decrementing `k` by 1 each time until `k` becomes 0.
- The variable `i` starts at `k-1` and is not modified within the loop, so it ends up as `k-1` (which is -1 when the loop finishes).
- The variable `num` is incremented based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration where `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1, and for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.
- The variables `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
