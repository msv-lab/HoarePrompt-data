To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(k):`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to -1, but this value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition. The loop will automatically set `i` to 0 on the first iteration.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `i` being -1 does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`num`, `m`, `n`, `t`, `c`, `r`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1, `num` is 0, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, `i` and `dp` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `i` is -1 and `dp` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n` and `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp[1]` = 1, `dp[2]` = 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `n`, `dp[j]` is calculated as `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
