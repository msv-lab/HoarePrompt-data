Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.** 

The variable `a` is now assigned the minimum value from the list `l`, while the other variables (`n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
