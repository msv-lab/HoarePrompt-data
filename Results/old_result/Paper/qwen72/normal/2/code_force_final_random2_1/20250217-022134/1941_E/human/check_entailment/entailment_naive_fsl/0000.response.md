Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in `func_1` where it incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation only considers the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d`, but it does not ensure that the supports are placed at valid positions according to the distance constraint.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 100 1 0
```
Here, the river grid is:
```
0 1 100 1 0
```
The maximum distance between supports is `2`. According to the problem description, the valid positions for supports are:
- (1, 1) and (1, 5) (required by the problem)
- (1, 3) (since the distance between (1, 1) and (1, 3) is 1, and the distance between (1, 3) and (1, 5) is also 1)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` will calculate the cost as follows:
- `row[0] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 1))
- `row[1] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 2))
- `row[2] = 101` (cost of placing a support at (1, 3))
- `row[3] = 2` (cost of placing a support at (1, 4))
- `row[4] = 1` (cost of placing a support at (1, 5))

The function will return `1 + 2 + 101 + 2 + 1 = 107`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the valid placement of supports according to the distance constraint.

The correct minimum cost should be `1 + 101 + 1 = 103` (placing supports at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5)).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
