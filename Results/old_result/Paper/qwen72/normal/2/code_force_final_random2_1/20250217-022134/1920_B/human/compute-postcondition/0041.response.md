To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `k`:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - Otherwise, it is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Explanation:
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- The first element of `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, which subtracts twice the sum of the first `x` elements from `sum1`.
- Subsequent elements in `ans` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop. The loop iterates `k` times, updating the value of `sums` accordingly.

### Final Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the list `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following inputs for clarity:
- `n = 5`
- `k = 3`
- `x = 2`
- `a = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `sum1 = 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30`
   - First element of `ans`: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:2]) = 30 - 2 * (10 + 8) = 30 - 36 = -6`

2. **Loop**:
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 < 5`
     - `sums = -6 + 10 - 2 * 6 = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8`
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 < 5`
     - `sums = -8 + 8 - 2 * 4 = -8 + 8 - 8 = -8`
   - For `i = 3`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 < 5`
     - `sums = -8 + 6 - 2 * 2 = -8 + 6 - 4 = -6`

So, `ans = [-6, -8, -8, -6]`.

### Final Output:
The maximum value in `ans` is `-6`.

Output: **-6 (where -6 is the maximum value in the list `ans`)**
