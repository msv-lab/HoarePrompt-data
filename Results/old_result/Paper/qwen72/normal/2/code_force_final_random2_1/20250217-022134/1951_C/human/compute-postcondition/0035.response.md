The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is `b`, `k` is `c - a * min(b, c) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c)) - min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `s` is `min(b, c - a * min(b, c))`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`**
