Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `I` is defined, `R` is defined, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 3. Otherwise, `v1` remains 1.***
