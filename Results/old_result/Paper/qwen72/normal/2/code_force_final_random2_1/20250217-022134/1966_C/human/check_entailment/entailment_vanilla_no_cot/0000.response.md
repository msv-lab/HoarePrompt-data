Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided program is flawed. The program attempts to find the "mex" (minimum excludant) value, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the array. However, this approach is not suitable for determining the winner of the game described.

The game is a variation of the Nim game, but with a twist where the same number of stones `k` must be removed from all non-empty piles. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is won by the player who forces the other into a position where all remaining piles have an even number of stones, because the player who faces such a position will always lose if the opponent plays optimally.

The correct approach involves checking the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of odd piles, and the player who leaves an even number of odd piles for the opponent will eventually win.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Count the number of piles with an odd number of stones
        odd_piles = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 != 0)
        # If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins
        print('Alice' if odd_piles % 2 != 0 else 'Bob')
```

This corrected function should produce the correct output for the given problem.
