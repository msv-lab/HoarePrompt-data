The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the value of `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than `k`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
- `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`.
- If `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is equal to the first element of `lista_B` and `pref` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:

- `soma_b` is incremented by the value of `lista_B[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, if `lista_A[1] < lista_B[1]`, then `pref` is equal to the first element of `lista_A` and `soma_b` is now equal to `lista_B[1]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is now equal to the sum of the first element of `lista_B` and `lista_B[1]`, and `pref` is 0.**
