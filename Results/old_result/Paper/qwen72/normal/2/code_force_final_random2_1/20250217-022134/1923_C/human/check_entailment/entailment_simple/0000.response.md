Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. This part is handled well and matches the problem description.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `l` and stores it in the list `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray using the formula `p[b-1] - p[a-2]` (if `a-2 >= 0`). This approach is efficient and correct.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, ..., r_i]` using the cumulative sum list `p`. It then checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying two conditions:
   - The subarray has more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
   - The sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

   These conditions are derived from the problem statement:
   - Condition 1 ensures that there is at least one pair of indices where `a_i` and `b_i` can differ.
   - Condition 2 ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to allow for all `b_i` to be different from `a_i` and still be positive.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise. This matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
