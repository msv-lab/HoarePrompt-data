To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.

### Analysis:
1. **Check All Elements in Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The variable `check_all` is assigned the result of the expression `all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - This expression checks if all elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Condition for `new` List:**
   - If `a[n-2]` is greater than `a[n-1]`, a new list `new` is created containing elements from `a` starting from index `n-1` to the end.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Breaking Out of the Loop/If Statement:**
   - Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.
- The conditions and variables described do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
