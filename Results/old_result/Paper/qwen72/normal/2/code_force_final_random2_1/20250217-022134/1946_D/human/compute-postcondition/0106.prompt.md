Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is the final result of the XOR operation of all elements in `a` that contributed to `ai` when `op` was 0, `val` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not 0, `v` is even, and `v` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least two elements. If `op` is 0, `op` is updated to the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `op` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and `a` must have at least one element. `val` is the next element in the list `a`. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
