The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples but is now `k+2` elements shorter and must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` (in the order they were popped) plus the last `item` that was removed from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, but it is now `k+2` elements shorter and must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
