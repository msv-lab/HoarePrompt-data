The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is `bets + 1` and `a[bets]` is `prod // a[bets]`, the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[bets + 1]`) is converted to an integer and added to `sumo`.

Since the exact values of `sumo`, `a`, `bets`, and `prod` are not specified, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables. The value of `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[bets + 1]` to its current value.

Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`, `a[bets]` is `prod // a[bets]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[bets + 1])`.**
