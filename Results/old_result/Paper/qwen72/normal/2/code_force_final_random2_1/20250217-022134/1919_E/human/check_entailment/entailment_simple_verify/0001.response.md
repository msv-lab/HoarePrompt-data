### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of 1s and -1s that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with an offset to handle negative indices.
   - The DP array `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum `j - n` using the first `i` elements of `a`.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the DP array based on the previous state.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, we can either add 1 or -1 to it.
   - This is reflected in the transitions: `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is `p[-1]`.
   - We adjust this sum using the offset and return the value from the DP array.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as small and large values of `n`.
   - It ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range and the DP array is updated correctly.

7. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout the execution.
   - The initial state of `dp` is correctly set, and the transitions are applied correctly.
   - The final state of `dp` is used to compute the result, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming and handles the input and output as specified. The annotations and the reasoning align with the expected behavior of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
