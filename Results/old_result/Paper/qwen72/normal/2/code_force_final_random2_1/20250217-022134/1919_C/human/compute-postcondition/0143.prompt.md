Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated. If any element in `l` is greater than its preceding element, `b` is set to the first such element found, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `b` remains 0, and `c` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `b` and `c` remain as they were before the loop started. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and either `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, or `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is less than `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `b` remains as it was before the loop started. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in the list `l` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is now equal to `l[x]` and `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `y + 3`, `y` is the last value it reached before the loop terminated and is less than `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is updated to `l[y + 3]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` may have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
