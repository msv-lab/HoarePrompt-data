Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the initial number of cards of each type. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or a non-zero integer. If `k` is non-zero, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is `k % (n-1)` if the condition `(n-2 + 1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k` was met, otherwise `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise `y` is 0. If `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[n-2] + k // (n-1)` if the condition `(n-2 + 1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k` was met at the last iteration, otherwise `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is `k % (n-1)` if the condition was met, otherwise `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `r` is either `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, or the last value calculated based on the conditions within the loop if `k` is 0, `rem` is the remainder of the last division operation performed, `y` is the number of elements remaining in the list `a` after the loop has processed, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` remains a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `k` is either 0 or the remaining value after all subtractions. If `k` is not 0, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop. If `k` is 0, `r` remains the last value of `a` that was updated, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the last index before breaking or completing the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
