The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the next `n` elements from `data` starting at `index` to integers.

- `p` was initially a list of `n` integers derived from the `data` list, starting from `index - 1 - n` to `index - 2`.
- Now, `p` is updated to a new list of `n` integers derived from the `data` list, starting from `index` to `index + n - 1`.

The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the current iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index `index` to index `index + n - 1`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 2*n, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
