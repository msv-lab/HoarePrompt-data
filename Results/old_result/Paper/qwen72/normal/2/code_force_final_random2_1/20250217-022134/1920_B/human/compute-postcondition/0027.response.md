Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums`.
- Initially, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
