The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (the loop counter), and `t` (the number of iterations). The loop will continue to execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, indicating that there are still iterations left to be performed. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, it is implied that it increments by 1 with each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect that `t` is now one less than its previous value, but still greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, and `max`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum of the minimum values found between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, or 0 if no such value was found.**
