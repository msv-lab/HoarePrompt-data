Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[1]`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 ≥ 1`, `x2 ≤ n`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, `y1` is now `y1 + (m - y2)`, `c` is `m - (y1 + (m - y2))`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is calculated as `m - y1`, where `y1` has already been updated to `y1 + (m - y2)`.
- Therefore, `c` is `m - (y1 + (m - y2))`, which simplifies to `y2 - y1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
