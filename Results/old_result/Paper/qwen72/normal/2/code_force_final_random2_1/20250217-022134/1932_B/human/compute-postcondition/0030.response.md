Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed, `path` is the string at the last index in `data` that was processed, `data` remains a list of strings representing the input split by spaces, `index` is the final index after processing all elements, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains 0.
- The variable `n` holds the integer value of the last element in `data` that was processed.
- The variable `path` holds the string at the last index in `data` that was processed.
- The list `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original strings split by spaces.
- The variable `index` holds the final index after processing all elements in `data`.
- The list `results` contains the results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
