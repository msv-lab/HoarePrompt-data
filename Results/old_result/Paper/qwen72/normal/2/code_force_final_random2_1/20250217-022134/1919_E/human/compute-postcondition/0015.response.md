Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is converted from the corresponding string in `data` from index 2 to index 2 + n - 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read` by whitespace, `index` is 3 + n, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 + n` to `3 + n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged.
