The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer conversions of these parts to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
