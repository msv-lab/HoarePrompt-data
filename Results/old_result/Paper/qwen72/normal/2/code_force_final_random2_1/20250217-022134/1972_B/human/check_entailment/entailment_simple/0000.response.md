Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the winner of a game where players alternately remove a facing-up coin and flip its adjacent coins. The key insight for solving this problem is to recognize that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') determines the outcome of the game. Specifically, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice (the first player) will have the advantage and can force a win; if it's even, Bob (the second player) can force a win.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of 'U' in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`. It then checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd (`num_up % 2 == 1`), the function returns 'YES', indicating that Alice wins. If the count is even, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob wins.

This logic aligns with the problem's requirements and the examples provided. The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case independently.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
