The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not. After the increment, `num` will be either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is `n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `c` and `r` are the second set of input integers and remain unchanged.**
