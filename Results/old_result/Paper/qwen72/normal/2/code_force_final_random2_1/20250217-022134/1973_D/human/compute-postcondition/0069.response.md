To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The loop will execute if `cnt` is non-zero.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must still be non-zero. Therefore, `cnt` should remain as `k - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The loop will execute if `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, and we need `cnt` to be non-zero, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
- **`l`**: Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and we need `l` to be less than `n + 1`, no adjustment is needed for `l` as long as `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
Since both conditions (`cnt` and `l < n + 1`) are already satisfied based on the given state, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
