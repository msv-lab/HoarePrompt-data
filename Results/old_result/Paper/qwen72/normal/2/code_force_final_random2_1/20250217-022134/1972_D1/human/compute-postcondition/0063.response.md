Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. Finally, it prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state includes `T` being the total number of test cases processed, `a` and `b` being the last input values for the final test case, and `suma` being the calculated value for the final test case. **
