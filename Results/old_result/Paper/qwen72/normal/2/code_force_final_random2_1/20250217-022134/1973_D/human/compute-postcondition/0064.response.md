Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`.
- `l` is updated to 1.
- The conditions `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is such that `n // k + 1 >= 3` remain unchanged.
- The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` remains valid because `cnt` is now `k` (which is not 0) and `l` is 1 (which is not equal to `n + 1`).
