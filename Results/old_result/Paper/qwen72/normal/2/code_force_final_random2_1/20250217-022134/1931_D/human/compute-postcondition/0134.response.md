To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements:
     - The first element is the initial value of `beautiful_count`.
     - The second element is the final value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `n` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `test_cases[0]['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `test_cases[0]['array']` and must have `n` elements.
   - `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the remainders when an element of `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and the value is the count of how many times this pair of remainders appears in `a`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution. Each iteration updates `freq` and potentially increments `beautiful_count` based on the conditions specified in the loop.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string "Beautiful pairs count: " followed by the value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `beautiful_count` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is stored in `results[1]`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Since the exact value of `beautiful_count` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.
   - The output will be the string "Beautiful pairs count: " followed by the final value of `beautiful_count`.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the final value of the count of pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) found in freq during the loop execution)**
