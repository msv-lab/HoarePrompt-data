Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is now `[0, 0, v], `v` is `y - x`.** 

Explanation: The value of `v` is updated to `y - x`. The list `b` is updated to `[0, 0, v]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged.
