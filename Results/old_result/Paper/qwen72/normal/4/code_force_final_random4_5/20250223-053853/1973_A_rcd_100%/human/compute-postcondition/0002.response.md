Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. Depending on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, it will print one of the following: -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, `p1 + p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, or the result of a calculation involving `x` and `y` if neither of the above conditions are met. After all iterations, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last values read from the input, and `x` and `y` will be the last values calculated in the loop.**
