Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from the input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` reads a single integer from the input.
   - `func_3()` reads a line from the input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer, returning a list of these integers.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. This is done by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?', and only the specified direction if `c` is '0' or '1'.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that if the ball could be with player 0 (which is not a valid player), it is replaced with player `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of these players.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic required to determine the possible positions of the ball after all throws. The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, and the final adjustment for player 0 ensures that the output is valid. The program also efficiently processes multiple test cases.
