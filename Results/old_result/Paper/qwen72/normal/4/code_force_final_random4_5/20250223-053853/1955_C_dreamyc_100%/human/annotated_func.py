#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

    #State: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.

    #State: `s_a` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`, which is the number of elements in `nums`. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` (where `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` (where `b` is `k // 2`) when counted from the end of the list. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, and the list `nums` remains unmodified.
