Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for the problem described. Here are the reasons:

1. **Function Name and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is called, but it does not match the problem's requirements. The function should be named more descriptively, and it should take `n` and `m` as parameters, not `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Valid Pairs**: The program's logic for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is incorrect. The program calculates `ans` by adding `n` to the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`. This logic does not correspond to the problem's requirement of counting pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is a crucial part of the problem's condition.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This involves using the `math.gcd` function to compute the GCD and then applying the condition.

5. **Efficiency**: The current approach is not efficient for large values of `n` and `m` as described in the problem constraints. A more efficient approach would involve precomputing the GCD values and using them to count valid pairs.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
