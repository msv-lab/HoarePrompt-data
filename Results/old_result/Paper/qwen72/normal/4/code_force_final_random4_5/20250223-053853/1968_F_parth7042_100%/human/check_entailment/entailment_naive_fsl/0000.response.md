Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the check:

```python
if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
    results.append('YES')
else:
    results.append('NO')
```

This check is not sufficient to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` only checks if there is a valid split point where the prefix XORs match, but it does not ensure that the subarray can be split into more than one part with equal XOR values.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
```

The subarray `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` should be considered interesting because it can be split into two parts, each with a XOR value of 0:
- `[1, 1, 1]` and `[1, 1]` (both parts have a XOR of 1).

However, the program will output "NO" for this query because it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The program only checks if there is a valid split point, but it does not ensure that the split results in parts with equal XOR values.
