The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should be called multiple times with different values of `a` and `b`, as specified by the number of test cases `t` (1 <= `t` <= 10^4). `n` is an input integer.**
