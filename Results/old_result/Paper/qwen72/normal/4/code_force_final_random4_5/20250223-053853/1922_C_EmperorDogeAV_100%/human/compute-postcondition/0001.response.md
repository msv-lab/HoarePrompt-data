The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `n - 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] ≤ 10^9, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
