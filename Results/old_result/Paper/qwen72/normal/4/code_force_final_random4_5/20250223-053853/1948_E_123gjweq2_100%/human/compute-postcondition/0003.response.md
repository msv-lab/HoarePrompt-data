Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and (`right` - `left` + 1) is the number of elements to be assigned in the array `arr`. `clique` is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the elements in the range [left, right] in the `cliquess` array. `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`. `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`. `mid` is equal to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. `not_mid` is equal to `(right - left + 1) - mid`.**

In natural language: The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The variable `mid` is still equal to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The new variable `not_mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) - mid`, which represents the number of elements not in the middle part of the range [left, right].
