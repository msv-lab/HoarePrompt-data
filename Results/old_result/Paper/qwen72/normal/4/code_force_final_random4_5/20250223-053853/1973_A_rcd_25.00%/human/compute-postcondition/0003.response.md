The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers representing the scores of the three players, and they are sorted in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30).

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a value based on the scores, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
