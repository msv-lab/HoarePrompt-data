Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Reading and Looping Over Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

3. **Condition to Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - If `a >= b`, it means the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price. In this case, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit, which is `n * a`.
   - If `a < b`, Bob should consider selling some buns at the modified price. The program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price, which is `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price dropping below `a`.

4. **Calculating the Profit:**
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total profit for each test case.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the maximum profit is calculated accurately for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
