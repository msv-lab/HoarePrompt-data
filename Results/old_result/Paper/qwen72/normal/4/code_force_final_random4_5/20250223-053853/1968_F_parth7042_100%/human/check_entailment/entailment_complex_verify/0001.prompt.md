You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #This is printed: [each element of results on a new line, where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO']
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves a list of integers `a` and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero or if there exists a valid subarray within the range that results in a zero XOR. The function prints 'YES' for each query where the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each on a new line, corresponding to the queries. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input data has been fully processed, and the results of the queries have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for large inputs.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list. This is a common technique to handle multiple test cases and queries in a single input.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         a[i] = int(data[index])
         index += 1
         pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
         mp[pf[i]].append(i)
     ```
   - The prefix XOR array helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l] to a[r]` using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x == 0`, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part has a XOR of 0, which is trivially interesting. The program correctly appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x != 0`, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the appropriate indices in the `mp` dictionary.
   - The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` where the XOR of the segments can be equal.

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects all the results in a list and prints them at the end using `print('\n'.join(results))`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and parsing.
- The prefix XOR array is correctly computed and used to efficiently answer the queries.
- The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is correct. It correctly identifies when the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the required indices in the `mp` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
