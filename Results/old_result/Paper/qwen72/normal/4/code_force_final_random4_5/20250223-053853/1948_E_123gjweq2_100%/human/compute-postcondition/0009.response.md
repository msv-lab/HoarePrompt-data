The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left <= right`, and `(right - left + 1)` represents the number of elements to be assigned in the array `arr`. `clique` is a positive integer that represents the clique number to be assigned to the elements in the range `[left, right]` in the `cliques` array.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It assigns the value of `clique` to the elements in the range `[left, right]` of the `cliques` array.**
