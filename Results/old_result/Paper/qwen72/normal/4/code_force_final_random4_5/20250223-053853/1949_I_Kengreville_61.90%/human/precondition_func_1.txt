i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers, each of length n, where x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of booleans of length n, where visited[i] indicates whether the i-th disk has been visited. nodes is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component. coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, used to store coefficients for the i-th disk.
