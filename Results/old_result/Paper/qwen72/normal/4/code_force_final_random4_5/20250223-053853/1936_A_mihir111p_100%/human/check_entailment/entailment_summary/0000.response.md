Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Loop**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0. This variable will store one of the indices that will maximize the XOR.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `ans1` such that `p_ans1` is the maximum value among all `p_i` using bitwise OR queries.
   - The query `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` is used to compare `p_ans1` with `p_i`. If `p_i` is greater, `ans1` is updated to `i`.

2. **Second Loop**:
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. These variables will help in finding the second index that maximizes the XOR with `ans1`.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` to find indices `i` such that `p_i | p_ans1` is equal to `p_mx | p_ans1`.
   - If `p_i | p_ans1` is less than `p_mx | p_ans1`, `v` is reset to a new list containing `i`, and `mx` is updated to `i`.
   - If `p_i | p_ans1` is equal to `p_mx | p_ans1`, `i` is appended to `v`.

3. **Final Loop**:
   - The program initializes `mx` and `ans` to the first element in `v`.
   - It iterates over the remaining elements in `v` to find the index `ans` such that `p_ans` is the maximum value among all `p_i` in `v` using bitwise OR queries.
   - The query `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])` is used to compare `p_ans` with `p_v[i]`. If `p_v[i]` is greater, `ans` is updated to `v[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

**Analysis**:
- The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- The first loop finds the maximum value in the permutation, which is a good starting point for maximizing the XOR.
- The second loop finds all indices that, when ORed with `ans1`, produce the same result as the maximum value found in the first loop.
- The final loop ensures that among these indices, the one with the maximum value is chosen, which helps in maximizing the XOR.

However, there is a potential issue:
- The program assumes that the maximum value of `p_i | p_ans1` will lead to the maximum XOR. This is not necessarily true. The XOR operation is different from the OR operation, and the maximum OR value does not guarantee the maximum XOR value.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the XOR operation, the program's approach is not guaranteed to find the correct pair of indices that maximizes the XOR. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
