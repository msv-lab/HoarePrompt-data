### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows operations where an element at index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) can be replaced with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, which counts the length of consecutive identical elements.
   - It initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are the same and resetting `same` and updating `minn` when a different element is found.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` with the last `same` value.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program incorrectly updates `i` and `num` when a different element is found. It should not increment `i` twice in the else block.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has only one unique element. In such a case, removing any element will not make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It should find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and then determine if removing one less than this length will make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - If the minimum length is 1, it means the array can be made non-beautiful by removing one element.
   - If the minimum length is 2, removing one element will not make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the minimum length is greater than 2, removing one less than this length will make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the array consists of all identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so we output -1.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has logical errors in handling the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and in updating the loop variables. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
