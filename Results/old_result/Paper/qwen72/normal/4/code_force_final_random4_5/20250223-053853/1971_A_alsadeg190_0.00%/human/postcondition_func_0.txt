The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with two non-negative integer inputs `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 9. For each test case, it prints the larger value followed by the smaller value. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last input values provided for the final test case, and the value of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged.
