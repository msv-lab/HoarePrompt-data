The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players after playing chess games. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided.**
