### Reasoning:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by iterating through the grid and choosing the path that minimizes the string at each step.
   - The variable `work` is used to decide whether to take the next character from the top row (`a`) or the bottom row (`b`).
   - The condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` ensures that if the current character in the bottom row is smaller than the next character in the top row, the grasshopper jumps down to the bottom row to minimize the string.
   - The condition `elif i + 1 == len(a)` ensures that if the grasshopper is at the last column, it must take the character from the bottom row to complete the path.
   - The condition `else: i += 1` ensures that the grasshopper continues to the next column in the top row if the current character in the top row is smaller or equal to the next character in the top row.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program then counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The variable `counter` is initialized to 1, representing the initial path.
   - The loop `for j in range(len(a) - 1)` iterates through the characters of the strings to count the number of valid paths.
   - The condition `if a[j + 1] == b[j]` checks if the next character in the top row is the same as the current character in the bottom row, which means the grasshopper can jump down at this point and still form the same string.
   - The condition `elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` resets the counter if the next character in the top row is '0' and the current character in the bottom row is '1', as this is the lexicographically smallest choice.
   - The condition `else: break` breaks the loop if the current path does not match the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the grid is of size 2x2 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the grid is larger and the strings are longer, ensuring that the lexicographically smallest string is constructed and the number of paths is counted correctly.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
