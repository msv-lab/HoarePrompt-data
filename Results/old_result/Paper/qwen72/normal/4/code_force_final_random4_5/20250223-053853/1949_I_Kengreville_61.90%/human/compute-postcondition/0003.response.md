The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `i` and the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head. However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is True, `nodes` is a list of integers that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length n, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
