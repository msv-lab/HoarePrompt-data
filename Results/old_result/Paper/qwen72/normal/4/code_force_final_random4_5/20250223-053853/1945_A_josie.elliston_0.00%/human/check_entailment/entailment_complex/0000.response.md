### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 (`extroverts % 3 != 0`). If this is the case, it further checks if the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent, and the function returns `None`.
   - If the above condition is not met, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. This ensures that all extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents, with each tent containing up to 3 people.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of `func_1`.

3. **Validation of the Solution**:
   - The problem requires that each introvert must have a tent alone, and each extrovert must share a tent with exactly two others.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the extroverts and universals can be accommodated in the minimum number of tents, with each tent containing up to 3 people.
   - The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) to the result of `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no participants (`introverts = 0`, `extroverts = 0`, `universals = 0`), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If there are only introverts, the function correctly returns the number of introverts (since each introvert needs a separate tent).
   - If there are only extroverts and universals, the function correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required.
   - If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent for extroverts, the function correctly returns -1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required for the given constraints and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
