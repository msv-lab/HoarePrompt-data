Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be split into two parts and then swapped to form a non-decreasing array.
   - It concatenates the array `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It then checks if any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` is equal to the sorted version of `a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array `a` and calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
- If the array `a` can be split into two parts and swapped to form a non-decreasing array, then the sorted array `sorted_a` must appear as a contiguous subarray in `concatenated_a`.
- The loop in `func_1` checks all possible positions where `sorted_a` could appear in `concatenated_a`.

The input handling in `func_2` is also correct:
- It reads the entire input at once and processes it efficiently.
- It correctly handles the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program will produce the correct output for valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
