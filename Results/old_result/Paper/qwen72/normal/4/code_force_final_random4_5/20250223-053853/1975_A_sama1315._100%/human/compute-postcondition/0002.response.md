Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `idx` is 0.** 

The variable `idx` is initialized to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
