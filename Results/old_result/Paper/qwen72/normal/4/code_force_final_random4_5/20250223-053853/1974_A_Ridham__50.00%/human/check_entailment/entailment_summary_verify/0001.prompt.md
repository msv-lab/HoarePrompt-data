You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It calculates the minimum number of 15x15 screens required to fit all the icons for each test case and appends this number to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, showing the number of screens required for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required for all icons is then calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens (`screen_require_for_y = y // 2`). If `y` is odd, it adds 1 to the result of the division (`screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`).
   - This is correct because each screen can accommodate at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells).

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - It then checks if the space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining space (`remaining_cells`).

5. **Final Screen Calculation**:
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining space, the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list (`result.append(screen_require_for_y)`).
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining space, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`) and appends the sum of the screens required for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens to the result list (`result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)`).

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `x = 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` because no screens are needed.
- **Case 2**: When `x = 15` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit on one screen.
- **Case 3**: When `x = 0` and `y = 3`, the program correctly outputs `2` because 3 2x2 icons require 2 screens (one screen for 2 icons and another for the remaining 1 icon).
- **Case 4**: When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon can fit on one screen.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic required to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
