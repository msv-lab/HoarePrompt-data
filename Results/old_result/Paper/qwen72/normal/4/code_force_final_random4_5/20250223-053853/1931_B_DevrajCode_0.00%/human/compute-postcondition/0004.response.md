Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), a is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, total_water is the sum of all elements in the list a, total_water % n is equal to 0, target is equal to total_water // n.**

The variable `target` is assigned the value of `total_water` divided by `n` using integer division. This means `target` is the average value of the elements in the list `a`, which is an integer because the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
