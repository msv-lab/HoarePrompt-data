Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. It determines the index of the maximum item (`max_item_idx`) and the index of the last item (`pair_idx`) in the range [0, n-1] that is equal to or greater than the maximum item, as determined by the comparison function `func_1`. The function then prints the indices in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`. After the function concludes, `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item, and `pair_idx` is the index of the last item that is equal to or greater than the maximum item. **
