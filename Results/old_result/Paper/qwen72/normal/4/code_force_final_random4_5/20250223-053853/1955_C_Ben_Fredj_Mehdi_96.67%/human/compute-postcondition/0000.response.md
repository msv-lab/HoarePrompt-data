Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` and `k` are integers representing the number of ships and the number of Kraken attacks (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of integers representing the durability of each ship (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
