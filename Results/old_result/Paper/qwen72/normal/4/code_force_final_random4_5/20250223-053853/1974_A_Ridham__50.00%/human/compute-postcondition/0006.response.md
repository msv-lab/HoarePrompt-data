Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It calculates the minimum number of 15x15 screens required to fit all the icons for each test case and appends this number to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, showing the number of screens required for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
