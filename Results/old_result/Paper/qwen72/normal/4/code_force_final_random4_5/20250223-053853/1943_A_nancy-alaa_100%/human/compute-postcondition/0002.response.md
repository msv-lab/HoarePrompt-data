Output State: **The loop processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first such integer has been found. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case, and `first` is used to track the first occurrence of a unique integer. After all iterations, the initial state of the function remains unchanged, except that the output for each test case has been printed.**
