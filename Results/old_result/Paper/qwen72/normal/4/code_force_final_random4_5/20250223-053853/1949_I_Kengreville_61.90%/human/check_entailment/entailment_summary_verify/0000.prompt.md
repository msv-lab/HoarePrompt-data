You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` and modifies the `nodes` list to include the indices of all disks that are directly or indirectly connected to the `i`-th disk, where the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited. Additionally, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for each connected disk `j` by setting `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged. If the `i`-th disk is already visited, the function does not modify any lists.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to group disks that are tangent to each other and tries to determine if it's possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the logic for updating the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) and checking the feasibility of the solution is flawed.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
This input represents three disks with centers at (0, 0), (2, 0), and (4, 0), each with a radius of 1. The disks are tangent to each other in a linear sequence.

The program will:
1. Start a DFS from the first disk (0, 0, 1).
2. Visit the second disk (2, 0, 1) and set `coef0[1] = 1 + 1 - coef0[0]` and `coef1[1] = -coef1[0]`.
3. Visit the third disk (4, 0, 1) and set `coef0[2] = 1 + 1 - coef0[1]` and `coef1[2] = -coef1[1]`.

After the DFS, the coefficients will be:
- `coef0 = [0, 2, 0]`
- `coef1 = [1, -1, 1]`

The program then checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero. In this case, the sum is `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`, which is non-zero, so the program will print "YES".

However, this is incorrect. The problem requires that the sum of the radii strictly decreases, and the new radii should maintain tangency and avoid overlap. In this specific case, it is not possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. The disks are already in a configuration where any change in radius that maintains tangency will not decrease the sum of the radii.

Therefore, the correct output for this input should be "NO", but the program incorrectly outputs "YES". This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
