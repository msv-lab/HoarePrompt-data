Output State: **`g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. `n` and `k` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is equal to `n // k`.**

The variable `r` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `k` using integer division, which means `r` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `n / k`. All other variables (`g`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
