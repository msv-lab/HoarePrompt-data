### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers, `b` and `c`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, the program prints "YES". This is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2`
     - If the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same, the program prints "Yes". This is correct because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final count of cubes is `c`.
   - **Condition 4**: `else`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct because if the parity of `b` and `c` is different, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It checks if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, and if the parity of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is the same. If any of these conditions are met, it prints the correct output. Otherwise, it prints "No".

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
