Output State: The loop will print two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line will contain `1`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The second line will contain `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The variable `i` will have iterated through all values from 1 to `n`, and the loop will have completed its execution. The state of the other variables, such as `t` and `n`, remains unchanged.
