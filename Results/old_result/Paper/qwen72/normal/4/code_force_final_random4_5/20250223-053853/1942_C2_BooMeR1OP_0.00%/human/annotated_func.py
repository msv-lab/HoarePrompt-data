#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `x` is the same integer, `y` is the same integer, `present` is the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` is the same as in the initial state, `gaps` is a list of positive gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the addition of `n`).
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same sorted list of integers, `n` remains the same integer, `x` remains the same integer, `y` will be 0 if the loop completes without breaking or a non-negative integer if the loop breaks, `present` remains the same set of unique elements from `a`, `ans` will be the sum of all `gap` values added to it during the loop or the sum of `2 * y` if the loop breaks.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all gap values added to it during the loop if the loop completes without breaking, or 2 * y if the loop breaks, and y is a non-negative integer if the loop breaks or 0 if the loop completes without breaking)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen under the given constraints. The function prints the final count of chosen vertices, which includes Bessie's choices and the additional vertices chosen based on the gaps between Bessie's chosen vertices and the maximum number of additional vertices allowed. The function does not return any value.
