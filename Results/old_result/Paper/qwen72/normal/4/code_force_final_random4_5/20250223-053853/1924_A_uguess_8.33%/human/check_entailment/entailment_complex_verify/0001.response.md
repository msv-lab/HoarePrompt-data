### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the string `s`.

3. **Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in `s`.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is used to keep track of the characters seen in the current subsequence.
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, it calculates `cur_ss` as the index of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur` using `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`.
   - If the bit is not set, it sets the bit using `cur += 1 << cur_ss`.
   - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, so it increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it means there are at least `n` subsequences of length `k` in `s`, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It initializes `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets.
     - It then finds the first character in the first `k` alphabets that is not present in the current subsequence and appends it to `ans`.
     - Finally, it appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed.
   - The program constructs `ans` by adding `cnt` occurrences of the last character, which is incorrect because `cnt` represents the number of complete subsequences of length `k`, not the length of the string to be constructed.
   - The program should construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all `k` characters, leading to incorrect construction of the non-subsequence string.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Subsequence Checking:**
  - The program correctly identifies when a complete set of the first `k` characters is found in `s` and increments `cnt`.
  - This part of the program is accurate and correctly determines whether there are at least `n` complete subsequences of length `k` in `s`.

- **Output Logic:**
  - When `cnt >= n`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
  - When `cnt < n`, the program prints 'NO' and attempts to construct a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.
  - However, the construction of the string `ans` is flawed:
    - `ans` is initialized with `cnt` occurrences of the last character in the first `k` alphabets, which is incorrect. The length of `ans` should be `n`, not `cnt`.
    - The program then appends the first character that is not present in the current subsequence, but this does not guarantee that the resulting string will be of length `n` and not a subsequence.
    - Finally, it appends `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a' to `ans`, which is also incorrect because it does not ensure that the resulting string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Corrected Approach:
- To correctly construct a string that is not a subsequence of `s`:
  - Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
  - Check each generated string to see if it is a subsequence of `s`.
  - If a generated string is not a subsequence, print it.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program's logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed, and it does not ensure that the resulting string is of length `n` and not a subsequence of `s`.

Final: **False**
