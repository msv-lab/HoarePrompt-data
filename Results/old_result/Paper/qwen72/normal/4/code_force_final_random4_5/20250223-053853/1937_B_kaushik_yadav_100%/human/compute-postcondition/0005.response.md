Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints this string. It also calculates and prints the length of the longest contiguous sequence of characters in `a` and `b` where each character in `a` (starting from the second character) is either equal to the previous character in `b` or follows the pattern '0' in `a` and '1' in `b`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
