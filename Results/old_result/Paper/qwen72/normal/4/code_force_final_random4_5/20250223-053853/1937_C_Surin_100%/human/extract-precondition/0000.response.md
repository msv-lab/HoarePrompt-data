Precondition: **The function operates within an interactive environment where a secret permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1 is provided, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find the indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The input n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), and the total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.**
