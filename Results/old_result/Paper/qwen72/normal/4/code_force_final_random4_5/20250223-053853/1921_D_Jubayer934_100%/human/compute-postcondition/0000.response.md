The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be set to the current iteration index starting from 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer, which is consistent with the description of `t`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must return `t`**
