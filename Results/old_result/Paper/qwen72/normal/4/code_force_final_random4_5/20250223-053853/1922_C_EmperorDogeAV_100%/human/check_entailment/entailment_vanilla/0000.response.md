### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The coordinates are parsed from a string to a list of integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` to store the cost of moving to the closest city.
   - For each city, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (since moving to the closest city costs 1 coin).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction, which is calculated by reversing the cities list and then applying `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city and store the cost of moving to that city.
   - However, the function incorrectly sets the cost to 1 if the next city is closer, but it should set the cost to 1 for the closest city, not the next city.
   - The function also incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city if the previous city is closer, which is not the correct logic for the closest city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated correctly, but they are based on the incorrect closest city costs from `func_1`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The query processing logic is correct in terms of using the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum cost.
   - However, since the prefix sum arrays are based on incorrect closest city costs, the query results will be incorrect.

### Corrected Function:

To fix the issues, the function `func_1` should be modified to correctly determine the closest city and set the cost to 1 for that city. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to move to the closest city
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to move to the closest city
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Correctness:

Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the program as provided is incorrect. The corrected function should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
