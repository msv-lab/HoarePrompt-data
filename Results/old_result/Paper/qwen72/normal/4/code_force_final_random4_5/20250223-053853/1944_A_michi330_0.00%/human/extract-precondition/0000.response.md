Precondition: **The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n` and `k`, and the function should handle multiple test cases as described.**

For the correct function definition:
```
def min_islands_reachable(t, n, k):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of islands, and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2) representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed.**
