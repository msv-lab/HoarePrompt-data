The code snippet reads an integer value from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This value represents the number of test cases. The precondition specifies that `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other parts of the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the 2 × n grid. The total number of test cases, `t`, is now a specific integer value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The `input` variable now points to the function `sys.stdin.readline`, which reads a line from standard input.**
