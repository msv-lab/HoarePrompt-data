Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Score Validation**: For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` into a list `v`.
3. **Odd Total Score Check**: It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
4. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula works as follows:
   - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points.
   - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the number of games that could have been played without draws.
   - The result is divided by 2 to account for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points.

This approach correctly handles all the given test cases and constraints, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated or `-1` is printed if the scores are inconsistent.
