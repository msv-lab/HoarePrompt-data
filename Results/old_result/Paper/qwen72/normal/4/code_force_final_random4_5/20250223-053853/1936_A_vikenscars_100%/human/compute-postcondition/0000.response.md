Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, max_item_idx is 0, pair_idx is an integer in the range [0, n-1].** 

The initial state specified that `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^4, and both `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are integers within the range [0, n-1]. The code snippet `max_item_idx = 0` sets `max_item_idx` to 0, while the values of `n` and `pair_idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update.
