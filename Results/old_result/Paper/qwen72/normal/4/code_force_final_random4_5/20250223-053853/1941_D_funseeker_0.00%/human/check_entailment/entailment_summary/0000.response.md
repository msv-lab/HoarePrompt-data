Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` to read lines from stdin and strip any trailing whitespace. This is a common and correct way to handle input in Python.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input, which is also correct as per the problem description.
   - `func_3` reads the next line of input, splits it into three integers `n`, `m`, and `x`, and returns them. This is correct for the second line of each test case, which contains these values.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` from the input.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the current throw. This is done by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements if the direction is unknown (`?`), or only the specified direction if it is known (`0` or `1`).
   - The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handles the circular nature of the game, ensuring that the positions wrap around when they exceed the number of players `n`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the set `ans` contains `0`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and `0` should be interpreted as `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players. This matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case according to the rules, and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
