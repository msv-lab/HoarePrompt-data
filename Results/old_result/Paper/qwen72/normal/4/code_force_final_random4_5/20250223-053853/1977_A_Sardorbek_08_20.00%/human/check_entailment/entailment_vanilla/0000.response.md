### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This is correct.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to have a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: `a % 2 == b % 2`**:
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - **Case 4: Else**:
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct for the cases where `b` and `c` have different parities.

3. **Correct Parity Check**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. If they do, it is possible to achieve the desired tower height `c` after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the difference between the initial and final number of cubes must be even if the number of moves is even, and odd if the number of moves is odd.

4. **Output**:
   - The program should print "Yes" if `b` and `c` have the same parity, and "No" otherwise.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('Yes')
        elif b < c:
            print('No')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the parity check condition. It should check the parity of `b` and `c` instead of `a` and `b`.
- After correcting this, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
