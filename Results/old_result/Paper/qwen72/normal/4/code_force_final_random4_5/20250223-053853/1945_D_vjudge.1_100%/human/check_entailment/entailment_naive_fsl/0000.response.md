Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where Kirill is already in the first `m` positions. In such a case, Kirill should not need to spend any coins to move, but the program will still calculate and print a non-zero value.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, Kirill is already in the 5th position, which is within the first `m` (5) positions. Therefore, he should not need to spend any coins. However, the program will still calculate and print a non-zero value, which is incorrect.

The program should check if Kirill is already in a valid position and return 0 in such cases.
