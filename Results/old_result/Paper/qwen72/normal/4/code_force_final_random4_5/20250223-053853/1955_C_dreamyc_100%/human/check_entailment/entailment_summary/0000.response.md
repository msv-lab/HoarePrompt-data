Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining how many ships are sunk after the Kraken attacks them `k` times. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of ships sunk. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern as described in the problem statement.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates `a` and `b` as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. These values are used to count the number of ships that have a durability less than or equal to `a` when counted from the start and less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end.
   - This approach does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships. Instead, it simply counts the number of ships that could be sunk if the Kraken attacked the first `a` ships and the last `b` ships, which is not the same as the described attack pattern.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - The problem requires a simulation where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, and ships that sink are removed from the list of ships being attacked.
   - The provided program does not remove ships from the list once they sink, nor does it correctly alternate between the first and last ships.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is very large and the ships are attacked multiple times before they sink. The current logic does not account for the fact that the Kraken will stop attacking once all ships have sunk.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
