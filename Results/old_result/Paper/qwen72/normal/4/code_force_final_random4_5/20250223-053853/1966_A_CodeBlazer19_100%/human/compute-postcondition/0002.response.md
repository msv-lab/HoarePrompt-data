Output State: **The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the second is an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange. Additionally, each test case is followed by a list of `n` integers `c` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has printed `k - 1` if the maximum count of any card in the list is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it has printed `n`.**
