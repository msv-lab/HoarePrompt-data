### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading four integers that represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence determines the winner. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - The key observation is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the counts of numbers with a 1 in each bit position are all even. For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, the relevant bit positions are:
     - 1: 0001
     - 2: 0010
     - 3: 0011
     - 4: 0100
   - The XOR of the sequence will be zero if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are such that the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s and 3s (which contribute to the least significant bit) and the counts of 2s and 4s (which contribute to the second least significant bit) are both even.

3. **Optimal Removal**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - The function checks if all four counts are odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1, which accounts for the initial state where the XOR is zero.
   - For each count, it adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`. This is because removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will not change the parity of the XOR, and thus, Bob can win by removing these pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initial Check**: The condition `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` checks if all four counts are odd. If they are, it means the initial sequence has a zero XOR, and Bob wins once.
- **Pair Removal**: The loop `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` counts the number of pairs of each number. Removing pairs does not change the parity of the XOR, so Bob can win by removing these pairs.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The initial check and the pair removal logic are both correct and align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
