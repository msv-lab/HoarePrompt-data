The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0**
