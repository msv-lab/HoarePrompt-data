Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in `s1` is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre` starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.**

The code initializes a new list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) remain unchanged.
