Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and conditions used in the function to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are read and split correctly.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1: `n <= k`**:
     - If `n` (the number of parts of the ribbon) is less than or equal to `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint), Bob can always repaint all parts to a single color. Therefore, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, and the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**:
     - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color (i.e., the minimum number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color) is less than `k`.
     - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 2`, the most even distribution is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` or `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, where the most frequent color appears `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3` times.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that are not the most frequent color. If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint all these parts to the most frequent color, making all parts the same color. Therefore, the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, and the function prints 'Yes'.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'NO' or 'Yes' for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by printing 'NO' because Bob can always repaint the single part to any color.
   - It also handles the case where `m = 1` correctly by printing 'NO' because there is only one color available, and Bob can always repaint all parts to that color.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
