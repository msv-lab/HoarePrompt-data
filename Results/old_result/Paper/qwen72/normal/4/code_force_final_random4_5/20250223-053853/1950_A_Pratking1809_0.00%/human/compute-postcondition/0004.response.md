The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters. However, it is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each ranging from 0 to 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function processes these integers in some way.

Functionality: **The function is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each ranging from 0 to 9. The specific return value or output of the function is not provided.**
