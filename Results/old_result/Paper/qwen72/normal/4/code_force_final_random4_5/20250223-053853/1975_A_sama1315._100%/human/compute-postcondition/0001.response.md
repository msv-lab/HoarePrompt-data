The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `data` is now assigned this list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `data` now holds a list of strings representing the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.**
