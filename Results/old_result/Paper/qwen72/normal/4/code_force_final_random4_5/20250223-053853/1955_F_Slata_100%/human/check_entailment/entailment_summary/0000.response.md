### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game continues until the sequence is empty, with Eve removing one number at a time.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of the sequence depends on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of the numbers. Specifically, the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s that contribute a 1 to the least significant bit (LSB) is even.

4. **Count Analysis**:
   - Each number 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be represented in binary as:
     - 1: 0001
     - 2: 0010
     - 3: 0011
     - 4: 0100
   - The XOR of the sequence will be zero if the total number of 1s, 3s, and 4s (which contribute to the LSB) is even.

5. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the sum of the integer division of each count by 2, which effectively counts the number of pairs of each number.
   - It adds 1 to the sum if exactly three of the first three counts (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. This is because if exactly three of the counts are odd, removing one of them will make the total count of 1s, 3s, and 4s even, thus making the XOR zero.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs of each number, which contributes to making the XOR zero.
   - The additional check for exactly three odd counts ensures that removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, which is a valid strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and the properties of bitwise XOR.

Correctness: **True**
