Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the grid for each test case. It then reads the grid itself.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a 1x1 grid, the program will always output "YES" because the grid is already uniform.
   - For grids where the first row and the last row are not the same, but the first row is uniform, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform if the first and last rows differ and the first row is uniform.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row are uniform and the same. If they are not, it outputs "NO".
   - If the first row and the last row are the same or if the first and last characters of each row are the same, it outputs "YES". This is because if the first and last characters of each row are the same, you can always use these characters to color the entire grid uniformly.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in linear time relative to the size of the grid (O(n * m)), which is efficient given the constraints.

The logic and implementation appear to be sound and cover the necessary conditions to determine if the grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.
