The provided code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's break down the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed:

- **Initial State:**
  - `s` is a string input by the user.
  - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
  - `x` is -1.
  - The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.

The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
