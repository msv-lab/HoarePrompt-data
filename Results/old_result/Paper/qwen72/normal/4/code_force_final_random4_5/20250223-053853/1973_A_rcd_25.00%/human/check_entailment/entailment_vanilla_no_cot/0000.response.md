Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total score is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid, and it prints `-1`.

2. **Case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is because the third player could have drawn all games with the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all their games with each other.

3. **General Case:**
   - The logic for the general case is flawed. The program uses a while loop to try to find a valid number of draws, but the conditions inside the loop are not correctly formulated to ensure the maximum number of draws.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2` because each game contributes 2 points in total (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
- The number of draws is the number of games where points are split equally (1 point each).
- The number of wins/losses is the number of games where one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points distribution is valid and then maximizing the number of draws. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(total_games, p1 + p2)
        if p3 - (total_games - max_draws) >= 0:
            print(max_draws)
        else:
            print(-1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Total Points Check:**
   - If the total points are odd, print `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total with the given scoring system.

2. **Total Games Calculation:**
   - Calculate the total number of games played as `total_points // 2`.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `total_games` and `p1 + p2` because the third player's score `p3` must be at least as large as the number of non-draw games (i.e., `total_games - max_draws`).

4. **Validation:**
   - Check if the third player's score `p3` is at least as large as the number of non-draw games. If it is, print the maximum number of draws. Otherwise, print `-1`.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
