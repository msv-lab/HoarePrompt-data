The function `dfs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The function also implicitly uses the following parameters:
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length n, where `x[i]` and `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk.
- `visited` is a list of booleans of length n, where `visited[i]` indicates whether the i-th disk has been visited.
- `nodes` is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component.
- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length n, used to store coefficients for the i-th disk.

The function returns nothing explicitly, but it modifies the `nodes` list to include the indices of all disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk `i`, and updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited.

Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` and modifies the `nodes` list to include the indices of all disks connected to disk `i`, and updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited.**
