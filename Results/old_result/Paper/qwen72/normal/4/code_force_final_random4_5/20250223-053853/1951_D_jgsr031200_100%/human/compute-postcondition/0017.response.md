Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains unchanged (but its value is not specified in the initial state).
- `costs` remains unchanged (but its value is not specified in the initial state).
- `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1`, which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - `n // (1 - k)` is `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `0 // (1 - k)` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `k` (as long as `k` is not 1, which would make the denominator 0 and cause a division error).

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` is `0 // 1`, which is 0.

3. **Sum of the two values**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0` and `0`, which is `0`.

4. **Check the condition `h >= k`**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - The condition `h >= k` simplifies to `0 >= k`.
   - For `h` to be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be 0 or a negative integer.

### Conclusion:
- The code snippet `print('YES')` will execute if the condition `h >= k` is true.
- Given that `h` is 0, the condition `0 >= k` must be true for the print statement to execute.
- Therefore, `k` must be 0 or a negative integer.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `k`, but it is implied that `k` must be 0 or a negative integer for the condition to hold, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
