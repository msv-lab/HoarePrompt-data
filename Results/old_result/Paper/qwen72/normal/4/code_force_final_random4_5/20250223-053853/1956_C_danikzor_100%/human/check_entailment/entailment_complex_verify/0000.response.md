### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - This is because each permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) sums to \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, so the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the size of the matrix \( n \) and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - The maximum sum is calculated using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \), which is incorrect.
   - The number of operations is correctly set to \( 2n \).
   - The program then performs \( 2n \) operations, filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - The variable `n` is read from input.
   - The incorrect formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n \) operations, each filling a row or a column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - Correct maximum sum: \( 1 \times \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1 \).
     - Program output: \( 1 \times (1 + 1) \times (4 \times 1 - 1) // 6 = 1 \).
     - The program's output for the maximum sum is correct in this case.
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Correct maximum sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2(2 + 1)}{2} = 6 \).
     - Program output: \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \).
     - The program's output for the maximum sum is incorrect in this case.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's formula for calculating the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - The operations performed by the program are correct in terms of filling the matrix with permutations, but the sum calculation is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**. The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix elements.
