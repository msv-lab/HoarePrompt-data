Reasoning:  
The program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players. The key points to consider are:

1. **Total Points and Parity**: The total points scored by all three players must be even, as each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw). If the sum of the scores is odd, it's impossible to achieve the scores, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated as follows:
   - The total number of points scored by all players is `a + b + c`.
   - If all games were draws, the total number of draws would be `(a + b + c) // 2` because each draw contributes 2 points.
   - However, the number of draws cannot exceed the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores, `a + b`, because the third player (with the highest score) cannot have more draws than the sum of the other two players' scores.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the scores are all zero, no games were played, and the program correctly prints `0`.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are even but the distribution is impossible (e.g., `1 1 1`), the program correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the total points are 0, which is even. No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For `0 1 1`, the total points are 2, which is even. One draw between the second and third player is possible, so the maximum number of draws is `1`.
   - For `1 1 1`, the total points are 3, which is odd. This is impossible, so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For `1 1 2`, the total points are 4, which is even. Two draws (one between the first and second player, and one between the second and third player) are possible, so the maximum number of draws is `2`.
   - For `3 3 3`, the total points are 9, which is odd. This is impossible, so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For `3 4 5`, the total points are 12, which is even. Six draws (three between the first and second player, and three between the second and third player) are possible, so the maximum number of draws is `6`.
   - For `1 1 10`, the total points are 12, which is even. The maximum number of draws is `2` (since `a + b = 2` and `x = 6`).

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the logic required by the problem.
