Output State: The loop iterates `n` times, printing two lines for each iteration. Each line starts with the iteration number `i` (ranging from 1 to `n`), followed by the numbers from `n` down to 1 in reverse order. The first line of each iteration starts with `1`, and the second line starts with `2`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
