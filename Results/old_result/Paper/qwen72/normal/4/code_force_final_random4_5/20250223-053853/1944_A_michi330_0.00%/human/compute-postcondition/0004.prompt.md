You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n` and `k`, and the function should handle multiple test cases as described.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it printed `1`. Otherwise, it printed `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not retained after the loop, but the output of the loop depends on the input provided for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. It is designed to handle multiple test cases based on these parameters, but the exact output or behavior is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
