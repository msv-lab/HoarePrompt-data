The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are binary strings, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are integers `n` and `m` respectively, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b` with lengths between 1 and 200,000, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
