Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations to perform. For each of the `q` iterations, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return any value. **
