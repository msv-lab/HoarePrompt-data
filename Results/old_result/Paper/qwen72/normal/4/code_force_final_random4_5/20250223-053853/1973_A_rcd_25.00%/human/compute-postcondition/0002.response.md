Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. The loop will print a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated for each iteration, but the initial input values `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (which are not used inside the loop) will remain unchanged. After `t` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will end.**
