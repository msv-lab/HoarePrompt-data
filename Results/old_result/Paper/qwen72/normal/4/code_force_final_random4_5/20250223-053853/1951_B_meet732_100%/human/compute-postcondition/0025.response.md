Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and an integer `k` (0 ≤ k < n). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
- If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
- If there is exactly one element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`:
  - If this element's index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
  - If this element's index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
  - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k]`.
- If there are exactly two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`:
  - If the first element's index is 0, it returns the minimum of the second element's index minus 1 and `k - 1`.
  - If `k` is greater than the second element's index, it returns the maximum of the first element's index minus 1 and the difference between the second and first element's indices.
  - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of the first element's index minus 1 and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are the indices of the first and second elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, respectively. **
