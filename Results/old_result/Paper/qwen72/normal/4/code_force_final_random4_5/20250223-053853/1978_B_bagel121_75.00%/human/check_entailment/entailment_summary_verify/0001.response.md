### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`.
   - If `a >= b`, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable. Therefore, it prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the usual price is higher or equal, there is no benefit in using the modified price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a modified price without making the modified price less than the usual price `a`. This is correct because selling more than `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price would result in a price less than `a` for some buns, which is not optimal.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S = \frac{k}{2} \times (a_1 + a_k) \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term (`b`) and \( a_k \) is the last term (`b - k + 1`). The use of `int` for division ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for the problem.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then the sum of `ans` and `p2`. This is correct because it accounts for both the modified price and the usual price.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total profit for each test case. This is done inside the loop that processes each test case, ensuring that the correct profit is output for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a >= b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price and prints `n * a`.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit. The edge case where `k = 0` is also handled correctly, as it will fall into the `a >= b` condition and print `n * a`.

7. **Large Inputs:**
   - The program handles large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently. The arithmetic operations and the use of `int` for division ensure that the results are accurate and within the integer range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering both the usual price and the modified price promotion. It handles all edge cases and large inputs efficiently.
