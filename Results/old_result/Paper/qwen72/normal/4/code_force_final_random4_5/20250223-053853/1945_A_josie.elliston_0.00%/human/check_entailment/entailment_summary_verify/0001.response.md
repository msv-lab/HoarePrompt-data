### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The logic checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it ensures there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and the available universals, so the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases and General Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No participants (0, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed.
     - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0` which is correct.
   - **Case 2: Only introverts (7, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` because no tents are needed for extroverts and universals.
     - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7` which is correct.
   - **Case 3: Only extroverts (0, 24, 0)**
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `8` because 24 extroverts can be divided into 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `8` which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Only universals (0, 0, 10)**
     - `func_1(0, 10)` returns `4` because 10 universals can be divided into 4 tents (3, 3, 3, 1).
     - `func_2(0, 0, 10)` returns `4` which is correct.
   - **Case 5: Impossible to accommodate (1, 4, 1)**
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts need 2 more people to form a complete tent, but only 1 universal is available.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1` which is correct.

5. **General Cases:**
   - **Case 6: (1, 2, 3)**
     - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` because 2 extroverts can form one tent with 1 universal, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent.
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 7: (1, 4, 2)**
     - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts can form one tent with 2 universals.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 8: (1, 1, 1)**
     - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form one tent.
     - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns `2` which is correct.
   - **Case 9: (1, 3, 2)**
     - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `2` because 3 extroverts can form one tent, and 2 universals can form another tent.
     - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns `3` which is correct.
   - **Case 10: (19, 7, 18)**
     - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `9` because 7 extroverts can form 2 tents with 2 universals each, and the remaining 13 universals can form 5 tents (3, 3, 3, 3, 1).
     - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns `28` which is correct.
   - **Case 11: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `666666667` because 1000000000 extroverts can form 333333333 tents, and the remaining 1000000000 universals can form 333333334 tents.
     - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `1666666667` which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed for the participants based on their preferences. It handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
