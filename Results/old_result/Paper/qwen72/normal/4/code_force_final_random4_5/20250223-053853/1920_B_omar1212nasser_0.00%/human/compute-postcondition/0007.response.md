The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `removals`. For the loop to execute, `removals` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop itself.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.
- It is not the case that (`removals` == 6 and `negatives` == 3).

To ensure the loop executes, `removals` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
