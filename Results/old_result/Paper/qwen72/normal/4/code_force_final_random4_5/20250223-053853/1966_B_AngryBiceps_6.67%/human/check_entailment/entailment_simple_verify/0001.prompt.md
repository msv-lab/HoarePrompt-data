You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an n x m grid represented as a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B' indicating the colors of the grid's squares. The values of n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed 'NO' if the first row or the first column contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row or the last column, respectively. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop are undefined as they are overwritten in each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in a list \( a \).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first and last rows are not the same and the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first row cannot influence the last row if they are different.
   - Similarly, if the first and last columns are not the same and the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first column cannot influence the last column if they are different.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.
   - It checks if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row. If so, it prints "NO".
   - It checks if the first column (constructed from the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and different from the last column (constructed from the last characters of each row). If so, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is \( 1 \times 1 \) correctly by printing "YES" if the single square is the same color.
   - It also handles cases where the grid is already the same color by printing "YES".

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is sound. It correctly identifies situations where the grid cannot be made uniform due to the constraints of the operations.
   - The conditions it checks are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
