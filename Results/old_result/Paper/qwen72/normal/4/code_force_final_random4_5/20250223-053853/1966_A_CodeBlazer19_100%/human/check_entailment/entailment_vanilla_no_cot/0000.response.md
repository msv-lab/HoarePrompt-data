Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `k - 1`, otherwise, it prints `n`. This logic is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**: The program assumes that if any card number appears at least `k` times, the minimum number of cards left will always be `k - 1`. However, this is not always true. For example, if you have 10 cards all with the same number and `k = 4`, you can perform the operation multiple times to reduce the number of cards to 3, not just `k - 1`.

2. **Handling Multiple Card Numbers**: The program does not consider the possibility of having multiple card numbers with different counts. It should account for the total number of cards that can be reduced by repeatedly performing the operation on different card numbers.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each card number, determine how many cards can be reduced by performing the operation as many times as possible.
3. Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        min_cards = sum((x % (k - 1) + (k - 1) if x % (k - 1) != 0 else 0 for x in p))
        print(max(1, min_cards))

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Count the Frequency**: `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` creates a list of counts for each unique card number.
- **Calculate Remaining Cards**: For each count `x`, the number of cards left after performing the operation as many times as possible is `x % (k - 1) + (k - 1) if x % (k - 1) != 0 else 0`. This ensures that if `x` is a multiple of `k - 1`, no cards are left for that number.
- **Sum the Remaining Cards**: `sum(...)` adds up the remaining cards for all card numbers.
- **Ensure at Least One Card**: `max(1, min_cards)` ensures that the minimum number of cards left is at least 1.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
