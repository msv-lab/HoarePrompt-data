Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` as required by the problem description. Instead, it outputs the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what is needed. The correct logic should print the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This version will correctly output the minimum and maximum values for each test case.
