Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions provided. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
