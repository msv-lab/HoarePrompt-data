Output State: **The function `func_1` has not been called, and the variable `numbers` is an empty list. The initial state variables `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and `u_1` remain unchanged.**

The function `func_1` is not called in the provided code snippet, so its parameters and the problem description do not affect the current state. The variable `numbers` is initialized as an empty list, and no other variables are modified. Therefore, the initial state variables `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and `u_1` remain as they were initially.
