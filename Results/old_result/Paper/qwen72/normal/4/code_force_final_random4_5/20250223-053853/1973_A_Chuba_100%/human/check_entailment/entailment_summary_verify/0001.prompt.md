You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` from the input, representing the scores of three players. If the sum of these scores is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates a result based on the scores and prints this result. The function does not modify the input scores and performs these operations for each of the `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score of all players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have gained without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all those games.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the remaining points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points (1 for each player).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), correctly outputting `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), correctly outputting `-1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the total score is 0, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the total score is 2, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the total score is 3, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total score is 4, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total score is 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

The program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
