The only object in the loop head is the variable `z` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and `z` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `z` will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
