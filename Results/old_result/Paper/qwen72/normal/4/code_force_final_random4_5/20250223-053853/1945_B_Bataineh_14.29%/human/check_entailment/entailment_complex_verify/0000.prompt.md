You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output for each test case is either 2 or the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`, depending on the conditions `m < a` or `m < b`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained after each iteration, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then prints either `2` if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, or it prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no values are retained for `t`, `a`, `b`, or `m`. The function does not return any values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `m`. In such a case, the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously can be more than 2, but the program always prints 2 if `m` is less than `a` or `b`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 4 12
```
Here, the first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every 4 minutes. Both fireworks are visible for 13 minutes (from `x` to `x + 12`).

- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, ...

At time 12, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks will be visible from 12 to 24. Additionally, the fireworks launched at time 0 from both installations will still be visible at time 12 (since they are visible from 0 to 12). Therefore, at time 12, there will be 4 fireworks visible simultaneously (2 from the first installation and 2 from the second installation).

However, the program will output:
```
2
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be:
```
4
```

This shows that the program does not handle the case where the LCM of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `m` correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
