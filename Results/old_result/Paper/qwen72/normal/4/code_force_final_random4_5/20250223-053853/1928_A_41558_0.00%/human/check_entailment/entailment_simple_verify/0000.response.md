### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

1. **Initial Check for Odd Dimensions:**
   - The program first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints `NO` because an odd by odd rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a different rectangle. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Check for One Dimension Being Exactly Half of the Other:**
   - The program then checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints `NO`. This is intended to handle cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other. However, this check is flawed:
     - For a 2x2 rectangle, \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b / 2 == a\) are both true, but the correct output should be `NO` because the resulting rectangles (1x2) can only form a 2x2 rectangle again.
     - The program incorrectly prints `YES` for the 2x2 case because it does not account for the fact that both dimensions being even and equal should also result in `NO`.

3. **All Other Cases:**
   - For all other cases, the program prints `YES`. This is correct for most cases where the dimensions are not both odd and not one dimension being exactly half of the other. However, it fails for the specific case where both dimensions are even and equal.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should add a check to handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and equal, the program should print `NO`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program. The program does not handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal correctly.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
