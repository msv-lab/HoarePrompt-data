Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because in any valid set of games, the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw).

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of points distributed as draws.
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)` as the maximum number of draws.

4. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The total number of points distributed in draws is `x = (a + b + c) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores is `y = a + b`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of these two values because:
     - `x` is the total number of points that can be distributed as draws.
     - `y` is the maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores without exceeding their total points.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of scores is odd and prints `-1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) and prints `0` correctly.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid test cases.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `1`.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), so the program prints `-1`.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the program prints `-1`.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `6`.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the provided test cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
