The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `f` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the `f`-th element (0-indexed) in the list is greater than the `k`-th element (0-indexed) after the list is sorted in descending order. It prints 'NO' if the `k`-th element is greater, 'YES' if the `k`-th element is less, and 'MAYBE' if the `k`-th element is equal to the `f`-th element and either `k` is the last index or the next element is less than the `f`-th element. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state.
