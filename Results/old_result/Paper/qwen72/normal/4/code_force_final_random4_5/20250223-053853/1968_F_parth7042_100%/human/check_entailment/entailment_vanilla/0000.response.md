### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to optimize input reading in competitive programming.
   - The index `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` with an extra element to handle 1-based indexing.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is computed such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the left and right indices `l` and `r`.
   - It computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be split into parts where each part has a XOR of 0, which is trivially interesting. The program appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated. For any subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]`, the XOR can be computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is 0, which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be interesting.
  - For non-zero XOR, the program uses binary search to find indices that satisfy the condition for the subarray to be interesting. This is a valid approach because if `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` for some `i` and `j` within the range, it means the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when the subarray is the entire array or when the subarray is a single element.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the program can handle the constraints efficiently. The overall complexity is O(n + q log n), which is suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently handles the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
