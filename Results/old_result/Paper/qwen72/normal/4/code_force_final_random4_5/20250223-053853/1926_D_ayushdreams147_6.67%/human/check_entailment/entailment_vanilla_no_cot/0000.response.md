Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed, and it does not ensure that the numbers are grouped such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.

### Issues:
1. **Bit Manipulation**: The program uses `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to flip the bits of `num` up to the 31st bit. However, this operation is not necessary and does not help in solving the problem. The problem requires ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits, not flipping the bits of the numbers.

2. **Counting Logic**: The program attempts to count the occurrences of numbers and their bitwise complements, but this does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups needed. The program should instead focus on the unique bit patterns of the numbers.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to determine the unique bit patterns of the numbers. The minimum number of groups required will be the number of unique bit patterns, as each unique bit pattern must be in a different group to satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    # Use a set to store unique bit patterns
    unique_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Consider only the 31 least significant bits
        bit_pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        unique_patterns.add(bit_pattern)
    # The minimum number of groups is the number of unique bit patterns
    return len(unique_patterns)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Bit Pattern Calculation**: For each number, we calculate its 31 least significant bits using `num & ((1 << 31) - 1)`.
- **Unique Patterns**: We store these bit patterns in a set to ensure that each pattern is unique.
- **Result**: The minimum number of groups required is the size of this set, as each unique bit pattern must be in a different group.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of groups needed for each test case.
