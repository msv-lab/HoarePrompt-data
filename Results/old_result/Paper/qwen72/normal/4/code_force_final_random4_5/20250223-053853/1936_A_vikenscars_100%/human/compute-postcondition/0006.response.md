To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `pair_idx` is the index of the last item in the range `[0, n-1]` that is equal to or greater than the maximum item as determined by `func_1`.
- `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum item as determined by `func_1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`max_item_idx`**: This variable holds the index of the maximum item in the range `[0, n-1]` as determined by the function `func_1`. The exact value of `max_item_idx` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the data it processes.

2. **`pair_idx`**: This variable holds the index of the last item in the range `[0, n-1]` that is equal to or greater than the maximum item as determined by `func_1`. This means that `pair_idx` is the last index where the condition `item >= max_item` is true, where `max_item` is the value at `max_item_idx`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output a string formatted as `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`, where:
- `[max_item_idx]` is the index of the maximum item as determined by `func_1`.
- `[pair_idx]` is the index of the last item in the range `[0, n-1]` that is equal to or greater than the maximum item.

Since the exact values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` depend on the specific data and the implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where [max_item_idx] is the index of the maximum item as determined by `func_1`, and [pair_idx] is the index of the last item in the range [0, n-1] that is equal to or greater than the maximum item)**
