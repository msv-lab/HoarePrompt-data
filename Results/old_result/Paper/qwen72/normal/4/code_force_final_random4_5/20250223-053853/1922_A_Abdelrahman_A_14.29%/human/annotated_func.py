#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `i` will have the value `tests - 1` after the loop finishes executing all iterations. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks if the string `c` is either identical to `a` or `b`, or contains any character that is not present in both `a` and `b`. If `c` is identical to `a` or `b`, or if it contains a character not found in both `a` and `b`, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `i` holding the value `tests - 1`, `slength` holding the last `n` value, and `a`, `b`, and `c` retaining the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any test case resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.
