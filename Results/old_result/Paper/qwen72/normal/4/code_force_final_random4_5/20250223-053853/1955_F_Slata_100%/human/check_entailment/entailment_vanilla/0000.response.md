### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the XOR of all numbers is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the XOR of all numbers is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will not change the XOR result.
   - Removing an odd number of a specific number can change the XOR result.

5. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of each number that can be removed: \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \).
   - It also checks if there are three odd counts among the numbers. If so, it adds 1 to the result.

6. **Explanation of the Calculation:**
   - \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \) count the number of pairs of each number that can be removed without changing the XOR result.
   - The term \( int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) \) checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the numbers. If so, it means that removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win one additional time.

7. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the removal of pairs of numbers.
   - The additional check for three odd counts ensures that Bob can win one more time if the sequence initially has an odd number of three different types of numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

Correctness: **True**
