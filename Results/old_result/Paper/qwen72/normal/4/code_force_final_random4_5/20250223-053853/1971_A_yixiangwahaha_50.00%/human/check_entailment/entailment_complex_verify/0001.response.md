Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()`. However, it does not use `t` in the subsequent loop. Instead, it uses a fixed loop count of 10, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `t` times to handle the dynamic number of test cases.

2. **Storing Inputs**: The program creates two lists `x` and `y` to store the inputs for each test case. While this approach works, it is unnecessary and can be optimized. The program can directly process each test case as it reads the inputs, without storing them in lists.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The program reads the inputs for each test case and splits them into two integers, `x[i]` and `y[i]`. It then appends these values to the lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct but can be simplified.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum and maximum of `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each test case. This part of the logic is correct, but it should be done inside the loop that reads the inputs to avoid storing all inputs in lists.

5. **Fixed Loop Count**: The program uses a fixed loop count of 10, which is incorrect. The number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, and the program should handle this dynamically based on the value of `t`.

6. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct, but the overall structure of the program is flawed due to the fixed loop count and unnecessary storage of inputs.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The fixed loop count of 10 will cause the program to either read too many or too few test cases, depending on the value of `t`. This can lead to incorrect behavior and output.

Final: **False**
