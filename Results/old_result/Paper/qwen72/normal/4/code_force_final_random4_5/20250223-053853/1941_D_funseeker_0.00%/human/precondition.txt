The function `read` is intended to read input data, but the specific input format and validation are not provided in the function definition. Typically, it would read a series of test cases, each containing the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, the starting player `x`, and the details of each throw (distance `r_i` and direction `c_i`). The input is expected to be formatted as described in the problem statement, with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1, and c_i being '0', '1', or '?'.
