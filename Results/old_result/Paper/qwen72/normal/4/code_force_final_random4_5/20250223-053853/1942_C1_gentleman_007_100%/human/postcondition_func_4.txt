The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n. It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists. Each list at index `i` (where 0 <= i <= n) may contain integers that were appended during the loop execution, and each integer `x` appended to `l[i]` will also have `i` appended to `l[x]`. The function essentially creates a symmetric adjacency list representation of a graph with `n + 1` nodes, where `m` edges are added between nodes based on the values returned by `func_1`.
