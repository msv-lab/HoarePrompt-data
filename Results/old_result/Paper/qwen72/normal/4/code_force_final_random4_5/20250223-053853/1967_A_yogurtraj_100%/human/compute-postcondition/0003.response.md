Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending at most `k` coins. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from input, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. After processing, the function prints the result for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are updated and used during the loop, but they do not retain any meaningful state after the function concludes. **
