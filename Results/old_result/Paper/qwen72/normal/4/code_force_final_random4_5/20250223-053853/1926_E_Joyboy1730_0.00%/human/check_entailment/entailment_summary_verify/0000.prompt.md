You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions provided. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the process of laying down the cards in the specified order. Here are a few issues:

1. The list `L` is never populated with any values, so the loop `for a in L:` will never execute.
2. The logic for determining the order in which cards are laid down is incomplete and incorrect. The program does not correctly identify and lay down cards that are multiples of odd numbers in the specified order.
3. The variable `k` is being modified within the loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `n = 7, k = 4`:
- According to the problem description, the order of cards laid down should be 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
- The 4th card laid down should be 7.
- However, the program will not correctly determine this because the list `L` is empty, and the logic for laying down the cards is flawed.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
