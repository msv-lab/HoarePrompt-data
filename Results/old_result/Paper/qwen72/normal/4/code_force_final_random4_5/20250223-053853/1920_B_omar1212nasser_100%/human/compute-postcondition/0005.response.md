Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` remain non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, where the last element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers.**
