Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`).
   - Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s` and the index `x`, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
   - The conditions and constraints on `s` and `x` are irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any variables or objects from the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s` and `x`.

Output: **2**
