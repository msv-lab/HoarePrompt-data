You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the sorted list of integers for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are not retained after the function completes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last.
   - The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this sum.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order.
   - When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, but the sum of these differences will be maximized because the largest elements will be paired with the smallest elements, creating the largest possible positive differences.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array elements.
   - However, instead of calculating the beauty of the sorted array, it prints the sorted array elements as a space-separated string.

4. **Output Comparison**:
   - The program's output is the sorted array elements, which is not the required output.
   - The required output is the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The program simply sorts the array and prints it, which is not the expected behavior.
