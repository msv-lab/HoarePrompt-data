Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Since `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, both `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` are positive integers.**
