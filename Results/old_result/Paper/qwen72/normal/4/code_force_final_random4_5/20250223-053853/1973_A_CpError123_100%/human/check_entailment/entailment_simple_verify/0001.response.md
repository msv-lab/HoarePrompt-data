Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because in any valid set of games, the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw).

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of points distributed as draws.
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)` as the maximum number of draws.
   - However, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the use of `min(x, y)` need to be re-evaluated to ensure they correctly represent the maximum number of draws.

4. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The total number of points distributed in draws is `x = (a + b + c) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores is `y = a + b`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of these two values because:
     - `x` is the total number of points that can be distributed as draws.
     - `y` is the maximum number of draws that can occur between the two players with the lowest scores without exceeding their total points.
   - However, the calculation of `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` is not entirely correct. This formula calculates the total number of points that could be distributed as draws, but it does not account for the fact that the total number of games (both draws and non-draws) must be consistent with the scores.

5. **Correct Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The correct approach to calculate the maximum number of draws is to consider the total number of games played and the distribution of points.
   - Let `g` be the total number of games played. Each game results in 2 points being distributed (either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - Therefore, the total number of points `a + b + c` should be `2 * g`.
   - The number of draws `d` can be calculated as the difference between the total number of games and the number of non-draw games.
   - The number of non-draw games is `(a + b + c - 2 * d) / 2`, where `d` is the number of draws.
   - To maximize `d`, we need to minimize the number of non-draw games. The minimum number of non-draw games is `c - a` (the difference between the highest and the lowest score, as the highest score player must win at least `c - a` games to achieve the score `c`).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the sum of scores is odd and prints `-1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) and prints `0` correctly.
   - However, for cases like `1 1 1`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` instead of `0` because the scores are consistent with one draw and no wins/losses.
   - For cases like `3 3 3`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` instead of `3` because the scores are consistent with three draws and no wins/losses.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `1`.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), so the program prints `-1` (incorrect, should be `0`).
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the program prints `-1` (incorrect, should be `3`).
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `6`.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect in its calculation of the maximum number of draws for certain valid test cases.

Final: **False**
