Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt, which is `a`.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
   - It calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The logic correctly ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for any valid input within the specified constraints. The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 and when `n` is even or odd. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
