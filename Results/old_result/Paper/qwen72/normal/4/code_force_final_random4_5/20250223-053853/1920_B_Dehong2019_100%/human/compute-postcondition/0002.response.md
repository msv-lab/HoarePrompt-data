The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the range function that depends on `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (n, k, x, and the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
