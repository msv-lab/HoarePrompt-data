The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It then calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` and a value `p2`, and prints their sum. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values provided in the last test case, while `t` will be 0.
