### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water, but only in the direction from left to right (`i < j`).
   - To achieve the target amount in all containers, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference in water amounts from the target is non-negative as we move from left to right. This is because if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we need more water to reach the target, which is not possible with the given constraints.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total water and the target amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference (`container`).
   - For each container, it updates the cumulative difference by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It assumes the first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm itself is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring the cumulative difference remains non-negative.
   - The issue lies in the input handling, which only processes the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

Correctness: **False**
