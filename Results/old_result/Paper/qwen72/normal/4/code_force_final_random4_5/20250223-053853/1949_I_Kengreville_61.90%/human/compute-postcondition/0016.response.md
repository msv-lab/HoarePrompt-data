Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `False` (meaning that for all `i`, `c1` is `0` after the DFS).**
