The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function terminates.
