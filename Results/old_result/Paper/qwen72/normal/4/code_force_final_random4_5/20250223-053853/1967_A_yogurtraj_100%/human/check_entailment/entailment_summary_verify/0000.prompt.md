You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        r = a[0]
        rem = 0
        y = 0
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending at most `k` coins. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from input, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. After processing, the function prints the result for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are updated and used during the loop, but they do not retain any meaningful state after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.
2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of the minimum number of cards of each type.
3. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach to determine how many cards of each type can be increased using the available coins `k`. It iterates through the sorted array and calculates the cost to increase the number of cards of each type to match the next type in the sorted array.
4. **Breaking Condition**: If the cost to increase the number of cards exceeds the available coins `k`, it breaks out of the loop and calculates the remaining cards that can be added.
5. **Final Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum score by determining the number of complete subarrays of length `n` that can be formed and any additional subarrays that can be formed with the remaining coins.

The program handles edge cases and ensures that the maximum score is calculated correctly for each test case. Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
