Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not compute the required beauty value.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to calculate the maximum possible beauty by rearranging the array. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program sorts the array in descending order and then computes the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This will give the maximum possible beauty for the array.
