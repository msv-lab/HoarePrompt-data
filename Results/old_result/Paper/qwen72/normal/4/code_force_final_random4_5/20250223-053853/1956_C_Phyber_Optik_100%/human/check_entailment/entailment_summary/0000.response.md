Reasoning:  
The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either set the values of a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times in each row and column.

The provided program calculates a sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \). Let's break down this formula:
- \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 \) simplifies to \( 2i - 1 \).
- Therefore, the sum becomes \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \).

However, this formula is not the correct way to calculate the maximum sum. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n^2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} \).

The program then prints \( 2n \) operations, where each row and each column is set to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). This approach ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a value from 1 to \( n \), but it does not necessarily maximize the sum correctly.

To maximize the sum, we should set each row and each column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to ensure the highest values are used. The provided program does not do this.

Additionally, the sum calculation in the program is incorrect. For \( n = 1 \), the sum should be 1, and for \( n = 2 \), the sum should be 10, not 7.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
