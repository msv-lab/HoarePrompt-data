Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program is sorting the array and then printing the sorted array, which is not the required output.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output:
```
1 2 3
```
This is clearly incorrect as it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in descending order to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
2. Compute the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def max_beauty():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This implementation sorts the array in descending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which will give the maximum beauty of the array.
