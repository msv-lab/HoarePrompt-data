You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if at any point during the iteration over the elements of `a`, the cumulative difference between each element and the target value (which is the average of the elements in `a`) becomes negative. If the cumulative difference is non-negative for all elements, the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water, but only in the direction from left to right (`i < j`).
   - To achieve the target amount in all containers, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference in water amounts from the target is non-negative as we move from left to right. This is because if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we need more water to reach the target, which is not possible with the given constraints.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total water and the target amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference (`container`).
   - For each container, it updates the cumulative difference by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It assumes the first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm itself is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring the cumulative difference remains non-negative.
   - The issue lies in the input handling, which only processes the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

Correctness: **False**
