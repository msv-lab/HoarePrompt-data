You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers n and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile. t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            s.add(arr[i])
        
        s = list(s)
        
        s.sort()
        
        s = [0] + s
        
        ans = 1
        
        n = len(s)
        
        if n == 2:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                    break
                else:
                    ans ^= 1
            if ans:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')
        
    #State: The loop will iterate t times, and for each iteration, it will read n and a list of integers, process the list to determine if the game is won by Alice or Bob, and print the winner. After all iterations, the variables t, n, arr, s, ans, and i will be in their final states as determined by the last iteration of the loop, but the specific values will depend on the input provided for the last test case. The list s will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last arr list, with 0 prepended, and ans will be 1 if the last game is won by Alice, or 0 if won by Bob.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the number of stones in each pile for the corresponding test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
