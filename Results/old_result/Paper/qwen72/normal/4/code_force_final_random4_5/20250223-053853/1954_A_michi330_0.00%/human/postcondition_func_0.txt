The function `func` accepts no parameters and handles input and output internally. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of parts of a ribbon (`n`), the number of colors available (`m`), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (`k`). For each test case, it checks if it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of the ribbon such that the number of contiguous parts of the same color can be maximized. If the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` are met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are no longer relevant.
