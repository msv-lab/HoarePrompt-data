### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required for all icons is then calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens (`screen_require_for_y = y // 2`). If `y` is odd, it adds 1 to the result of the division (`screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`).
   - This is correct because each screen can accommodate at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells).

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
   - It then checks if the space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining space (`remaining_cells`).

5. **Final Screen Calculation**:
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining space, the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list (`result.append(screen_require_for_y)`).
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining space, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`) and appends the sum of the screens required for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens to the result list (`result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)`).

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `x = 0` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` because no screens are needed.
- **Case 2**: When `x = 15` and `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit on one screen.
- **Case 3**: When `x = 0` and `y = 3`, the program correctly outputs `2` because 3 2x2 icons require 2 screens (one screen for 2 icons and another for the remaining 1 icon).
- **Case 4**: When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon can fit on one screen.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic required to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
