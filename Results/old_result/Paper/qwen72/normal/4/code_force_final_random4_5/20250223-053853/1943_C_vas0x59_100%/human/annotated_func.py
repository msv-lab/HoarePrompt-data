#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(l):
    return max(range(len(l)), key=lambda x: l[x])
    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the original list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.
