The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, `a` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed for each case.
