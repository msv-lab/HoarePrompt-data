#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the second is an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange. Additionally, each test case is followed by a list of `n` integers `c` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the second is an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange. Additionally, each test case is followed by a list of `n` integers `c` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has printed `k - 1` if the maximum count of any card in the list is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it has printed `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to exchange `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. It then calculates the frequency of each unique card number in the list. If the maximum frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
