Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the variable `cost` has been calculated and printed, representing the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, with the maximum of `m` tickets purchasable each day. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` (the list of prices) retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop. The intermediate variables `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `mu` are recalculated for each test case and do not persist outside the loop.**
