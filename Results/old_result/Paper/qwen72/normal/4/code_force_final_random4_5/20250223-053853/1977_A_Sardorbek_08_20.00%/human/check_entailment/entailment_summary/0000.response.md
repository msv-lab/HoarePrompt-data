### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `a` (number of test cases) and `b` (number of moves) have the same parity (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be that `b` and `c` have the same parity.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints 'No'. This is correct if the previous conditions are also correct.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. If they do, it is possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, so the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == m:
            print('YES')
        elif n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The variable `t` is used to represent the number of test cases, which is more consistent with the problem description.
- The condition `if n % 2 == m % 2` is used to check if `n` and `m` have the same parity, which is the correct condition for determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
