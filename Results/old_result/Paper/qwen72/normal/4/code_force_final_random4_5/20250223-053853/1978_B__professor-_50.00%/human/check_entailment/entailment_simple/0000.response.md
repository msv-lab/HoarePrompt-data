Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Base Case (b <= a)**: If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The function correctly prints `n * a` in this case. This is correct because selling at a higher price (or equal) will always yield more profit.

3. **Promotion Case (b - a >= n)**: If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The function calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\). This is correct because it maximizes the profit by using the highest possible prices for all buns.

4. **Mixed Case (b - a < n)**: If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The function calculates the profit for the first `b - a` buns using the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\). It then adds the profit from the remaining buns, which is \(a \cdot (n - (b - a))\). However, the function incorrectly calculates the profit for the first `b - a` buns as \(\frac{(b - a) / 2 \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\), which should be \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).

5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the function is almost correct but has a small mistake in the mixed case calculation. The correct formula should be \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\) instead of \(\frac{(b - a) / 2 \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1)) / 2 + a * (n - k)))
```

This corrected version should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
