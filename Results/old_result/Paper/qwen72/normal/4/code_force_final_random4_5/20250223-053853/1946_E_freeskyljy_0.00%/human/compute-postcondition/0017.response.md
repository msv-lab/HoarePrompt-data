To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `i > 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N` is an integer
- `M1` is an integer greater than 1
- `M2` is an integer
- `L` is a list of integers
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the input
- `L[0]` is equal to 1
- `R[0]` is equal to `N`
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- Either `M1` is greater than 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`
- `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`

The key variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute if `i > 1`. According to the state, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

Since `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`, and it is equal to the first element of `R` (which is `N`), we need to ensure that `N` is greater than 2.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `N` is greater than 2, which will make `L[-1]` greater than 2, and consequently `i` greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 2, `M1` is an integer greater than 1, `M2` is an integer, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers provided by the input, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, either `M1` is greater than 1, or `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`**
