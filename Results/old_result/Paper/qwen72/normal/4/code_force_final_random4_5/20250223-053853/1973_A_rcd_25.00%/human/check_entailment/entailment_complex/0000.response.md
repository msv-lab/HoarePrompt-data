### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a set of games must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if `p3` is at least `p1 + p2`, it means that all games could have ended in draws, and `p1 + p2` is the maximum number of draws possible.
   - If the above condition is not met, the function attempts to find a balanced number of draws:
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively.
     - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
     - If such a value is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If no such value is found, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - The logic for finding the balanced number of draws is more complex, but it seems to be attempting to find a way to distribute the draws and wins such that the scores are consistent.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the test case `0 1 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because one game ended in a draw.
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the test case `1 1 2`, the function correctly prints `2` because two games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `3 3 3`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the test case `3 4 5`, the function correctly prints `6` because six games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `1 1 10`, the function correctly prints `2` because two games could have ended in draws.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and the logic is consistent with the problem description. The conditions and the loop for finding the balanced number of draws are appropriately implemented.
