You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should be called multiple times with different values of a and b, as specified by the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, reading pairs of integers `a` and `b` from the input. For each pair, it will check if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly half of the other. If either condition is true, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated with each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be the last pair read from the input. The value of `n` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even and equal. For example, for the input `2 2`, the program will output `YES`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `NO` because the 2x2 rectangle, when cut into two 1x2 rectangles, can only form a 2x2 rectangle again, which is the same as the original rectangle.

Let's break down the logic:
- The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints `NO` because an odd by odd rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
- The program then checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints `NO`. This is intended to handle cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but it incorrectly handles the case where both dimensions are even and equal.
- For all other cases, it prints `YES`.

The issue arises in the second condition. For a 2x2 rectangle, \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b / 2 == a\) are both true, but the correct output should be `NO` because the resulting rectangles (1x2) can only form a 2x2 rectangle again.

To correct this, the program should add a check to handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal.
