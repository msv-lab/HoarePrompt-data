### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line from standard input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits the input line and converts the parts to integers.
   - It then reads the throws for each test case, one by one, using `func_1()` to read the line, splits it into `r` and `c`, and converts `r` to an integer.

2. **Set Initialization**:
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program checks the direction `c` and updates the set `ans` with the possible positions of the ball after the throw.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of the modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

4. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing**:
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This adjustment is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` would correspond to player `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the player numbers in increasing order.

### Potential Issues:
- **Recursion Limit**: The recursion limit is set to a very high value (`100000000`), but the program does not use recursion. This setting is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Function Signatures**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not take any parameters, which is fine, but it might be more readable if they were given more descriptive names and comments.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation `q % n` can result in `0`, which is correctly adjusted to `n` at the end. However, it would be more intuitive to use `1`-based indexing throughout the program to avoid this adjustment.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the throws, and outputs the correct set of possible players who could have the ball at the end of the game. The logic is sound and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
