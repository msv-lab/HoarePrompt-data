### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem description mentions that the second integer should be `m`, not `k`. This is a discrepancy in the variable names, which could lead to confusion but does not necessarily affect the correctness if `k` is used consistently within the function.

2. **Initial Value of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is correct because the initial count of valid pairs is `n` (since for each `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair `(a, 1)` is always valid).

3. **Loop for Calculating Additional Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `root` (inclusive), where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - For each `i` in the loop, `cnt` is set to `i * i`.
   - The expression `(n + i) // cnt` is added to `ans`. This expression is intended to count additional valid pairs, but it is not clear why this specific formula is used. The problem requires pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, and this formula does not directly address that condition.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints `ans`, which is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` in the range from `2` to `root` (inclusive).

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` is not derived from the problem statement. The problem requires pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This formula does not seem to correctly count such pairs.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case `n = 10, m = 8`, the correct output should be `14` as mentioned in the example. However, the given program does not correctly compute this output using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula used in the loop does not align with the problem's conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**
