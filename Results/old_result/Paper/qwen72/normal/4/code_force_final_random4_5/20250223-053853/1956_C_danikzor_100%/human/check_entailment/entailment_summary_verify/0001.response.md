Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided solution initializes the matrix with zeroes and then performs \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation sets a row or a column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column is set to this permutation, the total sum of the matrix after \( 2n \) operations is \( 2n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n^2(n+1) \).

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum as \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6 \).
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n^2(n+1) \).

5. **Operation Verification**:
   - The program correctly prints \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the permutation used is \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is valid.

6. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum is \( n^2(n+1) \).

Given the incorrect sum formula, the program is not correct. The operations themselves are valid and will indeed set the matrix to the desired state, but the sum calculation is wrong. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
