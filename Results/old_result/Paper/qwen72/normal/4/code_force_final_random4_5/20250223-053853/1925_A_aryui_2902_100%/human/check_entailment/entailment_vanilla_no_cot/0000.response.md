Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The correct output should be a string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the characters 'a' and 'b', which are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program generates the string "aabb", which does not contain "ba" as a subsequence.

A correct approach would involve constructing a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. One such approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once. However, for simplicity, a more straightforward method can be used to ensure all subsequences are present in a non-cyclic manner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import itertools

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''.join(itertools.product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n))
    print(''.join(s))

def generate_string(n, k):
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
    alphabets = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]
    all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabets, repeat=n)]
    
    # Concatenate all subsequences to form the result string
    result = ''.join(all_subsequences)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = generate_string(n, k)
    print(s)
```

This program generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and concatenates them to form the result string `s`. This ensures that all required subsequences are present in `s`. However, this approach may not always produce the shortest possible string, but it will always be correct in terms of containing all subsequences. For the shortest possible string, a more sophisticated approach like constructing a de Bruijn sequence would be needed.
