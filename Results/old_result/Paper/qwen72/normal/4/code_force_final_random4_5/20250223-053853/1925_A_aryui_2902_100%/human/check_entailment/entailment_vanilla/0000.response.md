Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The resulting string `s` is then printed.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase alphabets `n` times. This means `s` will be of length `k * n`.
   - The string `s` will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets because every possible combination of `n` characters from the first `k` alphabets will appear in `s` due to the repetition.
   - However, the solution does not necessarily produce the shortest possible string. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `baab` is shorter than `aabb` and still contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The solution is correct in terms of generating a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - However, it does not always produce the shortest possible string, which is a requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect** because it does not always generate the shortest possible string that satisfies the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
