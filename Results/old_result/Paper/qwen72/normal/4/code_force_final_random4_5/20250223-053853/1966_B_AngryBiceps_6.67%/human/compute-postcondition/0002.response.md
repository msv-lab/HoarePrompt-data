The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from stdin, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an n x m grid represented as a list of strings, where each string contains characters 'W' and 'B' indicating the colors of the grid's squares. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The input constraints are as follows: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of test cases t is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing an n x m grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It processes each grid and returns a result for each test case.**
