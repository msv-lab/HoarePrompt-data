It seems there is a mismatch between the problem description and the provided function definition. The problem description indicates that the function should take an integer `n` as an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Let's correct the function definition to match the problem description:

Function definition:
```
def func_1(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.**
