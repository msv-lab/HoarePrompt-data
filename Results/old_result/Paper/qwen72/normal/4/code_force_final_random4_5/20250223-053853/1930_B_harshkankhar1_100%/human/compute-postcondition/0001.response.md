The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a`.

- `a[::2]` selects every second element starting from index 0.
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the even indices are `[1, 3, 5]`, and the elements at these indices are `[1, 3, 5]`. Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`, which are then assigned back to the even indices, resulting in `a` being `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), with the elements at even indices reversed.**
