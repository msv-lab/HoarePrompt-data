Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it printed `1`. Otherwise, it printed `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not retained after the loop, but the output of the loop depends on the input provided for each test case.**
