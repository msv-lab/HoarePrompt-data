The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. `a` and `b` are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'), and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b). 

Case_1: If the character at position `i` in string `a` is found in string `b` starting from index `j`, the function returns the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b`.

Case_2: If the character at position `i` in string `a` is not found in string `b` starting from index `j`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`, or -1 if the character is not found.**
