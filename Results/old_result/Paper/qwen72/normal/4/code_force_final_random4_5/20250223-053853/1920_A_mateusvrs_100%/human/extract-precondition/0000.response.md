Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. The constraints are provided as pairs (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, with a indicating the type of constraint and x the value involved. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
