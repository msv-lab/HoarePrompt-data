Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks for the first occurrence of a pair of friends (i and p_i) who are each other's best friends and immediately prints 2, assuming that this is the minimum number of invitations required. However, this approach does not account for all possible scenarios, such as when there are cycles or chains of friends that require more than 2 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will output `3`, which is correct for this case. However, for a more complex case like:
```
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```
The program will output `3`, but the correct answer should be `4` because the friends form a cycle of length 6, and you need to invite 4 friends to ensure at least 2 attend.

A correct solution would need to identify cycles and chains in the friendship graph and determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. Here's a more correct approach:

1. Identify cycles in the friendship graph.
2. For each cycle, determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend.
3. For chains, determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend.
4. Sum up the minimum number of invitations for all cycles and chains to get the final answer.

This more comprehensive approach would correctly handle all scenarios.
