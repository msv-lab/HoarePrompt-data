#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations on it, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will print two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line will contain `1`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The second line will contain `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1`. The variable `i` will have iterated through all values from 1 to `n`, and the loop will have completed its execution. The state of the other variables, such as `t` and `n`, remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input and prints a pair of values: the first value is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, and the second value is `2 * n`. It then prints two lines for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the integers from `n` down to `1` in reverse order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the input integer `n` has been processed, and the specified output has been printed to the console.
