Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Hardcoded Number of Test Cases**:
   - The program assumes that there are always 10 test cases, which is incorrect. The number of test cases `t` is provided as input, and the program should read `t` test cases, not a fixed 10.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t` as a string but does not convert it to an integer. This can cause issues when using `range(t)`.

3. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop `for i in range(10)` should be `for i in range(int(t))` to correctly handle the number of test cases.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program uses `' '` to separate the minimum and maximum values, which is unnecessary. The problem description does not specify the need for an extra space between the numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Convert t to an integer
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split()
        x, y = int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case correctly, outputting the minimum and maximum values of `x` and `y` for each test case.
