### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The program checks if both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because an odd-by-odd rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus no new rectangle can be formed.

2. **Half Dimension Check**:
   - The program also checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`). If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangles would be identical to the original one after cutting and reassembling, which does not form a new rectangle.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES'. This means that the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle different from the original.

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Odd Dimensions**:
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts would result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions. This condition is correctly handled.

- **Half Dimension**:
  - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle would result in two identical smaller rectangles. Reassembling these identical pieces would not form a new rectangle. This condition is also correctly handled.

- **General Case**:
  - If neither condition is true, the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be reassembled to form a 4x3 rectangle. This condition is correctly handled.

### Edge Cases:

- **1x1 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'NO' for a 1x1 rectangle because it cannot be cut into smaller rectangles.

- **2x1 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'NO' for a 2x1 rectangle because cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which cannot form a new rectangle.

- **3x2 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'YES' for a 3x2 rectangle because it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a 1x6 rectangle.

- **2x2 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'YES' for a 2x2 rectangle because it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a 1x4 rectangle.

- **2x4 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'YES' for a 2x4 rectangle because it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a 4x2 rectangle.

- **6x3 Rectangle**:
  - The program correctly prints 'NO' for a 6x3 rectangle because cutting it results in two 3x3 rectangles, which cannot form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the conditions described in the problem. It correctly identifies when a new rectangle can be formed and when it cannot.

### Correctness:
**True**
