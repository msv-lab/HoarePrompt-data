### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should accept `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` as parameters to match the problem description.
   - The function reads input directly within its body, which is not ideal for testing and reusability. However, this is a common practice in competitive programming.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It reads `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and stores them in a list `a`.
   - It then adjusts the vertices to be 0-indexed and sorts the list `a`.
   - A set `present` is created to keep track of the chosen vertices.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals.

4. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. The gaps are the number of vertices between two chosen vertices, considering the polygon's cyclic nature.
   - These gaps are stored in a list `gaps`.

5. **Gap Sorting and Triangle Maximization:**
   - The gaps are sorted in ascending order.
   - The function iterates over the gaps and tries to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices within the gaps.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If the number of pairs is less than or equal to the remaining `y` vertices, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If the number of pairs is greater than the remaining `y` vertices, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Answer Calculation:** The initial answer `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles.
- **Gap Calculation:** The gaps are correctly calculated and stored.
- **Gap Sorting and Triangle Maximization:** The logic for adding vertices within the gaps to maximize the number of triangles is correct. The function correctly handles the case where the number of pairs is less than or equal to `y` and the case where it exceeds `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
