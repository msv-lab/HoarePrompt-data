Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of type 3 constraints (values \( k \) must not be equal to).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000007) to represent the minimum upper bound for \( k \).
   - It initializes `bx` to -1 to represent the maximum lower bound for \( k \).

3. **Updating Bounds and Set:**
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and the value \( x \) if the constraint is of type 1 (i.e., \( k \geq x \)).
   - It updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and the value \( x \) if the constraint is of type 2 (i.e., \( k \leq x \)).
   - It adds the value \( x \) to the set `cx` if the constraint is of type 3 (i.e., \( k \neq x \)).

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no integer \( k \) that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) by subtracting the number of type 3 constraints within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) for each test case. It ensures that the bounds are updated correctly and that the type 3 constraints are accounted for by excluding them from the valid range.

Given the problem constraints and the program's logic, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
