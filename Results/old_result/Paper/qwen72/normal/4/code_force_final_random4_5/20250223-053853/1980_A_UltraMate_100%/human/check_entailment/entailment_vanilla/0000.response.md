### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Frequencies:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of problems Vlad needs to come up with.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'`, which represents the required difficulty levels for each round.
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`:
     - If `i` is not in the `Counter` `hmp`, it means Vlad has no problems of that difficulty level, so he needs to come up with `m` problems of that difficulty.
     - If `i` is in `hmp` but the count `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, it means Vlad has fewer problems of that difficulty level than required, so he needs to come up with `m - hmp[i]` problems.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the total number of problems needed, the program prints `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - For each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
    - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
    - 'F' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
  - Total `ans = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - For each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
    - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 2`
    - 'G' is in `hmp` but `hmp['G'] = 1 < 2`, so `ans += 1`
    - 'F' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 2`
  - Total `ans = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
  - For each difficulty level in `p = 'ABCDEFG'`:
    - 'A' is not in `hmp`, so `ans += 1`
  - Total `ans = 1`
  - Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned.
