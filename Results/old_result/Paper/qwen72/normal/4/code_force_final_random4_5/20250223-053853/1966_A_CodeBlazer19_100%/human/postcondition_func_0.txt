The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to exchange `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. It then calculates the frequency of each unique card number in the list. If the maximum frequency of any card number is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
