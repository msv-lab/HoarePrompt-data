Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`.
2. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1.
3. The substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1` (i.e., `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`).
4. `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any variables or objects defined in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `s`, `x`, or any other conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
