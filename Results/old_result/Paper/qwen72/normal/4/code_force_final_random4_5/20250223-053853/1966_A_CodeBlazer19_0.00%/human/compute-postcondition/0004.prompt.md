You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and the second element is a list of integers `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` representing the numbers on the cards (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged. The loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration, but the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not stored or used after the loop. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, k)` and a list `[c_1, c_2, ..., c_n]` of integers, where `n` is the number of cards, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is the number of cards exchanged during each operation, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each `c_i` is an integer representing the number on a card, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The function returns a list of results, where each result is the maximum number of cards that can be made to have the same number after performing the card exchange operation any number of times for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
