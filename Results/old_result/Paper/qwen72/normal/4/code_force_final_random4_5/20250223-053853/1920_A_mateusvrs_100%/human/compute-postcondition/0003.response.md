Output State: **`r` is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of valid numbers between the maximum of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum of type 2 constraints (`ax`) for each test case, excluding the numbers that are present in the type 3 constraints (`cx`). If `bx` is greater than `ax` for any test case, the corresponding entry in `r` is 0.**
