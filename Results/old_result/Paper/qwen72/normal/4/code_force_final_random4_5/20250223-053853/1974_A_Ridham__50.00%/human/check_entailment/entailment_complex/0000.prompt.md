Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: The `result` list contains the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens is calculated based on the values of `x` and `y` provided in the input. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, the number of iterations. The variables `x` and `y` will have the values of the last input provided, and `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` will be calculated based on the last values of `x` and `y`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the i-th iteration of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It calculates the minimum number of 15x15 screens required to fit all the icons for each test case and appends this number to a list `result`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `result` on a new line, showing the number of screens required for each test case. The function does not return any value.
