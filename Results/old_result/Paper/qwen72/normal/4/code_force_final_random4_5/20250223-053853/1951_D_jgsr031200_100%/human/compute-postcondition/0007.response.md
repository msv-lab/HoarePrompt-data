Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
