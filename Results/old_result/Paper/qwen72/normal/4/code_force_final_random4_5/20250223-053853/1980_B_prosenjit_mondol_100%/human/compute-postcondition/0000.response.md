The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `func` and its parameters `t` and `test_cases` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is not relevant, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
