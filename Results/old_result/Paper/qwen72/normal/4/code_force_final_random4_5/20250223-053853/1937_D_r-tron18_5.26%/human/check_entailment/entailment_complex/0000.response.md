Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid represented by a string of '<' and '>' characters.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character in the current cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - It is used to compute intermediate values in `func_2`.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of cumulative positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating these lists and calculating the time for each position.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sums of indices where the character is '<', starting from the end of the string.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results.

   - **Iteration**:
     - For each character in the string from right to left:
       - If the character is '>', it updates `ans` based on the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and `ans` based on the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the list `ans` which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the string and updates the `ans` list based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.
   - The use of cumulative sums and the logic to handle the inversion of characters and movement of the pinball is consistent with the problem description.
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where the string is entirely '<' or '>', and it does so by correctly updating the cumulative sums and calculating the time.
   - The function also handles cases where the string is a mix of '<' and '>', and the logic for calculating the time is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
