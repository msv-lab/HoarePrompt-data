The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `root`, and the range parameters. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value to iterate over. This means that the start of the range (2) must be less than or equal to the end of the range (`root + 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

We need to ensure that `root` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute. This can be achieved if `n` is at least 3, because `int(math.sqrt(3)) + 1` is 2.

So, for the loop to execute:
- `i` should start at 2.
- `root` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
