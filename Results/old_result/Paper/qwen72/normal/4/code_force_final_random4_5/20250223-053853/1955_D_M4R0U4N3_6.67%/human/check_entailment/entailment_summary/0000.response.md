Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing all elements of `b`.
   - `done` is initialized as an empty set.
   - `extra` is initialized as an empty set.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial subarray is good (i.e., if `len(done) >= k`), otherwise 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]`, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` by removing the element that is no longer in the current subarray (`a[r - m]`) and adding the new element (`a[r]`).
   - It checks if the updated subarray is good by verifying if `len(done) >= k`.
   - If the subarray is good, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is equal to `m` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is less than `m` correctly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, and check membership) are efficient, typically O(1) on average.

8. **Resetting for Each Test Case**:
   - The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset for each new test case, ensuring that the program does not carry over state from one test case to the next.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
