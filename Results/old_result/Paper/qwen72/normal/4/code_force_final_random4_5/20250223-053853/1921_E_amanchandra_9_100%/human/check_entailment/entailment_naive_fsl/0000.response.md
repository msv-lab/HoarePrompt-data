Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the draw condition and the winning conditions for Alice and Bob is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 5 1 1 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 1). Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, and Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left. Since Bob is already in the second-to-last row, he can only move to (3, 1), (3, 2), or (3, 0) (but (3, 0) is out of bounds). Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (2, 0) (but (2, 0) is out of bounds). 

After Alice's move, Bob will be in the last row, and Alice will be in the second row. Bob cannot move further, and Alice cannot move to Bob's position. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" as the winner. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the draw condition when one player is in the last row and the other player is in the second-to-last row.
