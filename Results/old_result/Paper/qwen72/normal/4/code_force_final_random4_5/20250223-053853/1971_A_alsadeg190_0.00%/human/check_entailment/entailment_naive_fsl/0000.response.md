Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the `if` and `else` blocks is incorrect. If `x > y`, it should print `y` followed by `x`, but the program prints `x` followed by `y`. Similarly, if `x <= y`, it should print `x` followed by `y`, but the program prints `y` followed by `x`.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 9
```
The program will output:
```
9 1
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
1 9
```

This is a clear violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
