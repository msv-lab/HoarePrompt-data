Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program processes multiple test cases, each with a different array. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the length of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array using an index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array `n`, it prints `-1` (indicating it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program correctly identifies the length of consecutive identical elements and updates `minn` accordingly.
   - However, the logic for updating `minn` and `same` is flawed. Specifically, the increment of `i` should be handled more carefully to avoid skipping elements.

2. **Handling All Identical Elements**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are identical by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element by printing `-1`.

### Corrected Logic:

The logic for updating `minn` and `same` should be revised to ensure that the program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and updates the index `i` properly. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Logic:

- **Correct Increment of `i`**:
  - The increment of `i` is now done correctly within the loop, ensuring that each element is processed once.

- **Update `minn`**:
  - `minn` is updated whenever a different element is encountered, and the loop ensures that the last segment of identical elements is also considered.

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical flaw in how it updates `minn` and handles the index `i`. The corrected version addresses these issues and should correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected version is correct.)
