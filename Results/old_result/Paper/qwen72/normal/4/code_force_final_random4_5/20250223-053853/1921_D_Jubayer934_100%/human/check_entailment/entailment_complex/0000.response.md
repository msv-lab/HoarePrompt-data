### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, and then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `b` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because it helps in maximizing the absolute differences.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted list `b` and calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements in `a`.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - The function checks if the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the element from the end of `b` (i.e., `b[-(n - i)]`) is greater than the difference with the current element from the beginning of `b` (i.e., `b[i]`).
   - If such a point is found, it switches to using elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements in `a`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Truncation of `b`**:
  - The line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` is unnecessary because `b` is already of length `m` after sorting. The correct line should be `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)`.
- **Indexing in Optimization Check**:
  - The optimization check uses `b[-(n - i)]` which is correct, but the loop should continue to append differences to `ans` even after the switch point is found.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)  # Corrected truncation
        
        for i in range(n):
            if temp == -1 and abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i if temp == -1 else -(n - i)]))  # Corrected indexing
        
        print(sum(ans))
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original code has a minor issue with the truncation of `b` and the indexing in the optimization check.
- After correcting these issues, the logic of the function is sound and should correctly compute the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False** (due to the minor issues mentioned, but the logic is fundamentally correct and can be fixed easily).
