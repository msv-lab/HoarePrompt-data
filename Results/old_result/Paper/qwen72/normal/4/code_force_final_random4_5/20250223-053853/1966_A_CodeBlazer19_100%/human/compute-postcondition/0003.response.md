The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers: `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` represents the number of cards to exchange (2 ≤ k ≤ 100). Each test case is followed by a list of `n` integers `c` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is the maximum possible sum of the numbers on the cards after performing the exchange of `k` cards.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `c`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is the maximum possible sum of the numbers on the cards after exchanging `k` cards for each test case.**
