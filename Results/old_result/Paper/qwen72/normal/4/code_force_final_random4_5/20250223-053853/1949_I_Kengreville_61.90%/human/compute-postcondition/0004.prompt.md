Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length n, where `x[i]` and `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk. `visited` is a list of booleans of length n, where `visited[i]` is True, indicating that the i-th disk has been visited. `nodes` is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component, and now `nodes` includes the integer `i`. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers of length n, used to store coefficients for the i-th disk.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
