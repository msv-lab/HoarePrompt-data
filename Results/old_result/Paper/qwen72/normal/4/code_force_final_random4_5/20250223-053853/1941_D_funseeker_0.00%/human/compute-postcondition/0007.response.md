Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed from the set and `n` is added to the set. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
