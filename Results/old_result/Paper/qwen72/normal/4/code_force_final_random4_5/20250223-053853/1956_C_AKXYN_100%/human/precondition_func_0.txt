The function does not take any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix a, and the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.
