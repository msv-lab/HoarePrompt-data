Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, the grid of size \( n \times n \) has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), the program should return the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that every diagonal has at least one colored cell. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
The grid size is \( 3 \times 3 \), and there are \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. The program should return 6, but it returns 5, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 6, as shown in the problem description's example for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \).
