Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score of all players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have gained without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all those games.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the remaining points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points (1 for each player).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), correctly outputting `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), correctly outputting `-1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the total score is 0, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the total score is 2, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the total score is 3, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total score is 4, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total score is 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

7. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is mathematically sound. It correctly accounts for the points that could have been distributed as draws and those that must have been won/lost games.
   - The use of `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the program does not overestimate the number of draws by considering the points that the highest-scoring player could have won without any draws.

8. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies when the scores are inconsistent (i.e., when the total score is odd). This is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and the logic is sound.

Final: **True**
