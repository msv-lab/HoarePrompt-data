### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over them. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because the maximum number of vertices that can be in a single clique is `k`, and if `n` is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining vertices will form an additional clique.

3. **Array Initialization**:
   - Two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, are initialized to store the assigned integers and the clique assignments, respectively. This is correct.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for assigning integers and clique numbers to a segment of the array.
   - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated to determine the range of integers to be assigned.
   - `mid` and `not_mid` are used to split the segment into two parts, one for increasing integers and one for decreasing integers.
   - The first loop assigns integers from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in increasing order and assigns the same clique number to these elements.
   - The second loop assigns integers from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` in decreasing order and assigns the same clique number to these elements.
   - This ensures that the integers assigned to each segment are distinct and that the clique assignment is consistent.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Array Name**:
  - The function `make_array` modifies `arr` but the program prints `cliquess` as the assigned integers. This is incorrect because `cliquess` should be used to store the clique assignments, not the integers assigned to the vertices.
  - The correct output should be `print(*arr)` for the assigned integers and `print(*cliquess)` for the clique assignments.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is modified to print `arr` for the assigned integers and `cliquess` for the clique assignments.
- **False** if the program is not modified, as it currently prints the wrong array for the assigned integers.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect array being printed for the assigned integers).
