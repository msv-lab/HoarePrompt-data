Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case for k == 1**: If `k` is 1, the program prints 1. This is correct because if you need to color at least one diagonal, you can color just one cell, and it will cover one diagonal.

3. **General Case for k <= 2 * n**: If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because:
   - Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - To cover `k` diagonals, you need at least `k / 2` cells, and since you can't color a fraction of a cell, you use the ceiling function to round up to the nearest integer.

4. **Case for k > 2 * n**: If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is correct because:
   - When `k` exceeds `2 * n`, you need to cover more diagonals than the number of cells in a single row or column.
   - The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that you cover the required number of diagonals by adding one extra cell to handle the additional diagonals beyond `2 * n`.

The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
