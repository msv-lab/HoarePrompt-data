You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. The conditions are 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. The function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        done = set()
        
        extra = set()
        
        for j in range(m):
            if a[j] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[j])
                done.add(a[j])
            else:
                extra.add(a[j])
        
        ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
        
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            if old in extra:
                extra.remove(old)
            elif old in done:
                done.remove(old)
                todo.add(old)
            if a[r] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])
            else:
                extra.add(a[r])
            if len(done) >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` that contain at least `k` elements from the set `todo`. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values for each test case, while the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset for each new test case. The variable `ans` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case and is used to accumulate the count of valid subarrays, which is printed at the end of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k` where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. It is intended to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the given context.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
