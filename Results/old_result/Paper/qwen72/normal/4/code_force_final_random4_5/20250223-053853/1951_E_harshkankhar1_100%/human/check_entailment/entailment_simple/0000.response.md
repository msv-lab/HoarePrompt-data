### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string `s` itself, and then returns.
     - This is correct because if the entire string is not a palindrome, it can be considered as a valid partition with one part.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]` and sets `x` to the index of this character.
     - If no such character is found (i.e., `x` remains -1), it means all characters in `s` are the same, and the string is a palindrome. In this case, it prints "NO" and returns.
     - This is correct because a string with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found (i.e., `x` is not -1), it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because if `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` ensures that both parts are non-palindromic.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`.
       - If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`, it prints "NO" and returns.
       - This is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, if `s` is "abccba" and `x` is 1, the function will incorrectly print "NO" even though "ab" and "ccba" is a valid partition.
       - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
       - This is correct because if `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` ensures that both parts are non-palindromic.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire string is not a palindrome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles the case where `x` is 1 or `n // 2` and the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome. This is a logical error that can lead to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a logical error in the handling of the case where `x` is 1 or `n // 2` and the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome. This can lead to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
