The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is a variable that will be iterated over, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
