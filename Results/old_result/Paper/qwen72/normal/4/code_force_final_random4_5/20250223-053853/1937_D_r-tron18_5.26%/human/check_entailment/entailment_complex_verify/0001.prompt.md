You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` is derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` is printed, `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters in `s1` starting from the end of the string, and `totalOne` is 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 1D grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each starting position.

3. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `suffZero` is a list used to keep track of the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is the list to store the results for each starting position.

   - **Loop through the grid from right to left:**
     - For each cell `i`:
       - If the cell contains '>', it means the pinball will move right.
       - The program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sums of '>' and '<' indices.
       - The program updates the cumulative sums and the result list accordingly.
       - If the cell contains '<', it means the pinball will move left.
       - The program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by considering the cumulative sums of '<' and '>' indices.
       - The program updates the cumulative sums and the result list accordingly.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is based on the cumulative sums of indices where the characters are '>' and '<'.
   - The program correctly handles the inversion of the characters after the pinball moves.
   - The program correctly updates the cumulative sums and the result list for each starting position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where the grid is entirely '<' or entirely '>'.
   - The program should handle cases where the grid is a mix of '<' and '>'.
   - The program should handle the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses cumulative sums to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times, which is efficient.
   - The overall complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative sums and the handling of character inversions are appropriate and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
