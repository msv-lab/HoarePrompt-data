The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations on it. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the intended functionality, the function should accept two parameters: `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and `n`, which represents the size of the matrix for each test case. Since the function definition is incomplete, it is unclear what the function returns. However, given the context, it is likely that the function returns some result based on the operations performed on the matrices for each test case.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the size of the matrix for each test case). The exact return value is not specified, but it is likely to return a result based on operations performed on the matrices for each test case.**
