The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The function returns the number of unique integers in `a` when each integer is considered in its complement form.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` when each integer is considered in its complement form.**
