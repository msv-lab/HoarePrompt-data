### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The coordinates are parsed from a string to a list of integers.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` to store the cost of moving to the closest city.
   - For each city, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - The function incorrectly sets the cost to 1 if the next city is closer, but it should set the cost to 1 for the closest city, not the next city.
   - The function also incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city if the previous city is closer, which is not the correct logic for the closest city.
   - The correct logic should be to set the cost to 1 if the closest city is either the next or the previous city, and to set the cost to the distance to the closest city otherwise.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction, which is calculated by reversing the cities list and then applying `func_1`.
   - The prefix sum arrays are calculated correctly, but they are based on the incorrect closest city costs from `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
   - The query processing logic is correct in terms of using the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum cost.
   - However, since the prefix sum arrays are based on incorrect closest city costs, the query results will be incorrect.

### Corrected Function:

To fix the issues, the function `func_1` should be modified to correctly determine the closest city and set the cost to 1 for that city. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to move to the closest city (next city)
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to move to the closest city (previous city)
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Correctness:

Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the program as provided is incorrect. The corrected function should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
