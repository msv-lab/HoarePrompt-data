You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations to perform. For each of the `q` iterations, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but remains unchanged throughout the function. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Reading the Digits**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is also correct as per the problem description.

3. **Checking for Stair**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true. This is the correct condition for a stair.

4. **Checking for Peak**:
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is true. This is the correct condition for a peak.

5. **Handling Other Cases**:
   - The program prints "NONE" if neither of the above conditions is true. However, the `else` block is not correctly placed. It should be outside the `if a < b > c` block to ensure that "NONE" is printed only when both conditions are false.

6. **Potential Issue**:
   - The `else` block is currently inside the `if a < b > c` block, which means it will print "NONE" even if the first condition (`a < b < c`) is true and the second condition (`a < b > c`) is false. This can lead to incorrect output.

7. **Correct Placement of `else`**:
   - The `else` block should be placed after both `if` conditions to ensure it only executes when neither condition is true.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the misplaced `else` block.

Correctness: **False**
