The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins.
  - `a`: a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning.

The function returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters. The exact return value is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes the input to determine some outcome related to the cards and coins.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. It processes these inputs to determine and return a result for each test case.**
