You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. The conditions are 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. The function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.

    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` that contain at least `k` elements from the set `todo`. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values for each test case, while the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset for each new test case. The variable `ans` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case and is used to accumulate the count of valid subarrays, which is printed at the end of each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b` and initializes the necessary sets and counters.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - After this initial check, it determines if the first subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` starting from the second subsegment.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous window.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `extra`, it is simply removed.
     - If `a[r - m]` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It then checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo`.
     - If it is, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If it is not, it is added to `extra`.
   - The program checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if the length of `done` is at least `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to efficiently check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
- It maintains the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of the elements and their status in the current subsegment.
- The initial check and the sliding window updates are done in a way that ensures the program correctly counts the number of good subsegments.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

### Correctness:
**True**
