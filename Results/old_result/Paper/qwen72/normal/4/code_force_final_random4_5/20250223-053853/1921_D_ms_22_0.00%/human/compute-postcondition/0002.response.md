The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This already ensures that `t` is greater than 0, so no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, with the length of `a_i` being `n` and the length of `b_i` being `m`. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
