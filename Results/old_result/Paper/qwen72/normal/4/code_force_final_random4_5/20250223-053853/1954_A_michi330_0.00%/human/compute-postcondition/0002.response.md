Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the output will either be 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will not be directly modified by the loop, but `itest` will have the value `t` after the loop completes.**
