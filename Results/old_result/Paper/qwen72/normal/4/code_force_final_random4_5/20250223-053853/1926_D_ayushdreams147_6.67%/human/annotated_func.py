#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered in its complement form (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` in its complement form and the value is the count of how many times its complement has been encountered minus the count of how many times the integer itself has been encountered.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered in its complement form.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered in its complement form (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`). The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the complement counts of the integers in `a`, but the final state of `count` is not relevant to the user. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `a`.
