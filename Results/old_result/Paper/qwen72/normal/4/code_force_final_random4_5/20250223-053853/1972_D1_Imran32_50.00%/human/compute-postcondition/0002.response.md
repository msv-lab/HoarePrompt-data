Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**

The value of `root` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
