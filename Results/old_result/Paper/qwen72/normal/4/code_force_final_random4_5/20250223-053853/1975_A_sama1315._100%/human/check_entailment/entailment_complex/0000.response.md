### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing array by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).
   - **Logic**:
     - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
     - The function iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any contiguous segment of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
     - If such a segment is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no such segment is found after all iterations, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic is correct because if a segment in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix, the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order.
     - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or cannot be sorted by the operation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the input data as a single string and splits it into a list `data`.
     - It initializes `t` with the first element of `data`, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It iterates `t` times, reading the length `n` and the list `a` for each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints each result on a new line.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - The results are printed in the correct format, one per line.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and meet the problem requirements. The program will correctly determine if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation and will handle multiple test cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
