The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000), an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
