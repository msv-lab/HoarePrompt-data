The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return some value, which is not explicitly defined.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a value, but the specific return value is not defined.**
