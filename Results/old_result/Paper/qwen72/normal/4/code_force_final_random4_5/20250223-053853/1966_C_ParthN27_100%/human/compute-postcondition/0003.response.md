Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines the winner of a game based on the stones in the piles and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' accordingly. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, and `i` being in their respective states as determined by the last test case, but the specific values depend on the input provided for the last test case. The list `s` will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last `arr` list, with 0 prepended, and `ans` will be 1 if the last game is won by Alice, or 0 if won by Bob. **
