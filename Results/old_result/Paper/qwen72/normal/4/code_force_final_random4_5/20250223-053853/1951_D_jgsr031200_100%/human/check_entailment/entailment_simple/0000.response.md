### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall, and the remaining coins will be 0, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

3. **Invalid Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" and returns. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` list and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall (`curr = n // i`), updates the total number of jewels bought (`h += curr`), and subtracts the cost of the jewels from `n` (`n -= i * curr`).
   - The goal is to ensure that the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", the number of stalls (2), and the prices of the stalls.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for `h` Calculation:**
  - The program assumes that setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` will always result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels. However, this is not always true.
  - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program sets up stalls with prices `5` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (costing 5 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), resulting in a total of 3 jewels. This is correct.
  - However, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program sets up stalls with prices `248` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (costing 248 coins) and 7 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), resulting in a total of 8 jewels. This is also correct.
  - The issue arises when `n` and `k` are such that the initial setup of stalls does not allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the program sets up stalls with prices `3` and `1`. Alice will buy 2 jewels from the first stall (costing 3 coins) and 3 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), resulting in a total of 5 jewels, which is incorrect.

- **General Solution:**
  - The program should consider a more general approach to set up the stalls. One possible correct approach is to set up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, setting up `k` stalls with prices `1, 2, 3, ..., k` will always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as long as `n` is at least the sum of the first `k` positive integers (`1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k`).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the total number of jewels bought is flawed.
