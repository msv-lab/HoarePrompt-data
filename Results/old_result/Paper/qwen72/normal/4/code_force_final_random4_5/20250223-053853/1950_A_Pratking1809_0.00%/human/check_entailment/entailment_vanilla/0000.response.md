Reasoning:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Reading the Digits**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is also correct as per the problem description.

3. **Checking for Stair**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true. This is the correct condition for a stair.

4. **Checking for Peak**:
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is true. This is the correct condition for a peak.

5. **Handling Other Cases**:
   - The program prints "NONE" if neither of the above conditions is true. However, the `else` block is not correctly placed. It should be outside the `if a < b > c` block to ensure that "NONE" is printed only when both conditions are false.

6. **Potential Issue**:
   - The `else` block is currently inside the `if a < b > c` block, which means it will print "NONE" even if the first condition (`a < b < c`) is true and the second condition (`a < b > c`) is false. This can lead to incorrect output.

7. **Correct Placement of `else`**:
   - The `else` block should be placed after both `if` conditions to ensure it only executes when neither condition is true.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the misplaced `else` block.

Correctness: **False**
