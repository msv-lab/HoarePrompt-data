To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- Each integer in `r` represents the count of valid numbers for each test case.
- The valid numbers are those that lie between the maximum of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum of type 2 constraints (`ax`), excluding the numbers that are present in the type 3 constraints (`cx`).
- If `bx` is greater than `ax` for any test case, the corresponding entry in `r` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*r, sep='\n')
```
- This `print` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line.

### Explanation:
- The `*r` in the `print` statement unpacks the list `r`, so each element of `r` is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each element is printed on a new line.

### Output:
- The output will be each element of the list `r` printed on a new line.
- Each element in `r` is an integer that represents the count of valid numbers for a specific test case, or 0 if `bx` is greater than `ax` for that test case.

Output: **[r[0] on a new line, r[1] on a new line, ..., r[n-1] on a new line] (where each r[i] is the count of valid numbers for the i-th test case, or 0 if bx > ax for that test case)**

This means that the output will be a series of integers, each representing the count of valid numbers for each test case, with each integer on a new line. If `bx` is greater than `ax` for any test case, the corresponding integer will be 0.
