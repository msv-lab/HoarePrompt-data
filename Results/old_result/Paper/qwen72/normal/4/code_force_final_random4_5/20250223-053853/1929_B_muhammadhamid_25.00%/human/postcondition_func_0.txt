The function reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, it prints either 1, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, or `k` divided by 2 plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in scope.
