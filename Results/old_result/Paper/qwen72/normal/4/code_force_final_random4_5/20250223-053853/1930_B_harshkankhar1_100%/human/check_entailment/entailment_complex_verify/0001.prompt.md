You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [n, 2, n-2, 3, n-4, 4, ..., 1] (where the elements at even indices are reversed in the list `a` from 1 to `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from user input where 3 <= n <= 10^5, creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list, and prints the modified list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list `a` is printed in the format [n, 2, n-2, 3, n-4, 4, ..., 1] where the elements at even indices are reversed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces using `print(*a)`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - The problem requires a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - The program generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices. This means that the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the list are reversed while the second, fourth, sixth, etc., elements remain in their original positions.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's consider the permutation generated by the program:
     - For `n = 4`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Reversing the elements at even indices results in `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
     - For `n = 3`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Reversing the elements at even indices results in `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - We need to check if these permutations satisfy the condition:
     - For `n = 4`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1, 4]`:
       - `p[1] = 3` does not divide `p[3] = 1`.
       - `p[2] = 2` does not divide `p[4] = 4`.
       - `p[3] = 1` does not divide `p[1] = 3`.
       - `p[4] = 4` does not divide `p[2] = 2`.
     - For `n = 3`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1]`:
       - `p[1] = 3` does not divide `p[3] = 1`.
       - `p[2] = 2` does not divide `p[1] = 3`.
       - `p[3] = 1` does not divide `p[2] = 2`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the elements at even indices are not in their original positions, which helps in breaking the divisibility condition.
   - For any `n`, the permutation generated by this method will ensure that no two elements at even indices and their subsequent elements will satisfy the divisibility condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
