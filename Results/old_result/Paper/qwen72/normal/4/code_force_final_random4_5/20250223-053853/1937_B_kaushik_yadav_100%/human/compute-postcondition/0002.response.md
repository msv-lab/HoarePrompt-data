To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `input` and the details of the test cases are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments.
- `t` is a specific integer value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- The `input` variable now points to the function `sys.stdin.readline`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is greater than 0. The placeholder `_` is automatically handled by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
