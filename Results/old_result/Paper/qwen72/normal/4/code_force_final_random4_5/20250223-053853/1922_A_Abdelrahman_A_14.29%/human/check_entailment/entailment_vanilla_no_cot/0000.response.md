Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Template Matching**:
   - The program checks if each character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`. This is not the correct way to determine if a template exists such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
   - The problem requires that for each position `i`, if the template has an uppercase letter, the corresponding character in `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of that letter, and the character in `c` must be the same as the lowercase version of that letter.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Template Constraints**:
   - The program does not construct a template that satisfies the conditions for both `a` and `b` to match and `c` to not match.
   - It simply checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if there exists a template t such that a and b match it, but c does not
        template_possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                # If a[i] == b[i], the template must have an uppercase letter at this position
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    template_possible = False
                    break
            else:
                # If a[i] != b[i], the template must have a lowercase letter at this position
                if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                    template_possible = False
                    break
        
        if template_possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Template Construction**:
  - For each position `i`:
    - If `a[i] == b[i]`, the template must have an uppercase letter at position `i` (e.g., 'A' if `a[i] == 'a'` and `b[i] == 'a'`).
    - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template must have a lowercase letter at position `i` (e.g., `a[i]` or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` matches the template in any of these cases, the template is not valid.

- **Output**:
  - If a valid template can be constructed, print 'YES'.
  - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

This corrected program should correctly determine the existence of a valid template for the given problem.
