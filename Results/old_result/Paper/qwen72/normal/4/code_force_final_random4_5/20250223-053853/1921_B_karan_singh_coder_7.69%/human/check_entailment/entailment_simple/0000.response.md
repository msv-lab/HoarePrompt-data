### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of boxes.
   - It then reads two strings `s` and `t` of length `n`, representing the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively.

2. **Counting Cats:**
   - `s1` is the count of '1's in the initial state string `s`, which represents the number of cats initially in the boxes.
   - `t1` is the count of '1's in the desired state string `t`, which represents the number of cats required in the boxes.

3. **Calculating Differences:**
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 and is used to count the number of positions where the initial state `s` and the desired state `t` differ.
   - The loop iterates through each character in the strings `s` and `t` and increments `cnt` if the characters at the same position are different.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Operations:**
   - If the number of cats in the initial state `s1` is equal to the number of cats in the desired state `t1`, then the minimum number of operations required is `s1` if `cnt` is non-zero (indicating that some cats need to be moved), otherwise, it is 0 (indicating that no operations are needed).
   - If the number of cats in the initial state `s1` is not equal to the number of cats in the desired state `t1`, then the difference `d` is calculated as the absolute value of `s1 - t1`.
   - The minimum number of operations required in this case is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`. This formula accounts for the fact that some cats need to be moved, and the remaining operations are either adding or removing cats.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum number of operations required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for counting the number of differing positions and the number of cats in both states is correct.
- The formula for calculating the minimum number of operations is also correct:
  - If `s1 == t1`, the number of operations is `s1` if `cnt` is non-zero, otherwise, it is 0.
  - If `s1 != t1`, the number of operations is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, which correctly accounts for the number of moves and the number of additions/removals needed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
