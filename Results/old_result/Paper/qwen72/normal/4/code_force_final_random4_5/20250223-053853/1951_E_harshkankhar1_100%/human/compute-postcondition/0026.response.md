Postcondition: ***`s` is a string where not all characters are the same as `s[0]`. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of a character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy `func_1`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies `func_1`. If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`), the function behaves accordingly to the if part. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`, the function behaves accordingly to the else part.***
