Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`, and it is not the case that (`removals` == 6 and `negatives` == 3).**
