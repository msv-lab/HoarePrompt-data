You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is distinct and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:

        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1

        #State: *`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, but currently `ind` has only one element; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; the first element of `ind` is not 0
        if (ind[0] > k) :
            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1, where `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.
        #State: *`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, but currently `ind` has only one element; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; the first element of `ind` is not 0; `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`

    #State: *`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; the length of `ind` is greater than 1
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Since the first element of `ind` is 0, the second element of `ind` is greater than 0, and `k` is an index in `a` where `x = a[k]`, the program returns the smaller of these two values: the second element of `ind` minus 1 or `k` minus 1.
    #State: *`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; the length of `ind` is greater than 1; `ind[0]` is not equal to 0
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Since `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, both `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` are positive integers.
    #State: *`a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2; `ind` is not an empty list; the length of `ind` is greater than 1; `ind[0]` is not equal to 0; `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`

    #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns one of the following values based on the conditions:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value that is one less than the variable `n`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `k - 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1, where `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is an index in the list `a`, `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Since the first element of `ind` is 0, the second element of `ind` is greater than 0, and `k` is an index in `a` where `x = a[k]`, the program returns the smaller of these two values: the second element of `ind` minus 1 or `k` minus 1.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Since `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, both `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` are positive integers.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
