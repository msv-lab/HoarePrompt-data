Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not stored or modified outside the loop, so they do not have a final output state. The loop prints a result for each iteration based on the input values of `n`, `a`, and `b` provided during each iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the loop execution.**
