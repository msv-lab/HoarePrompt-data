You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each of these four integers by 2, and adds 1 to the sum if exactly three of the first three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. The result of this calculation is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant as they are read and processed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the XOR of all numbers is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the XOR of all numbers is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will not change the XOR result.
   - Removing an odd number of a specific number can change the XOR result.

5. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of each number that can be removed: \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \).
   - It also checks if there are three odd counts among the numbers. If so, it adds 1 to the result.

6. **Explanation of the Calculation:**
   - \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \) count the number of pairs of each number that can be removed without changing the XOR result.
   - The term \( int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) \) checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the numbers. If so, it means that removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win one additional time.

7. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the removal of pairs of numbers.
   - The additional check for three odd counts ensures that Bob can win one more time if the sequence initially has an odd number of three different types of numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
