To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

Given the problem description, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0**
