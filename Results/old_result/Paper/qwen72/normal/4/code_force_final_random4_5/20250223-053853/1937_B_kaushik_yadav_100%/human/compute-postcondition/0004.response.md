The function `func` accepts no parameters. Internally, it handles multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The total number of test cases, `t`, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It returns results for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided.**
