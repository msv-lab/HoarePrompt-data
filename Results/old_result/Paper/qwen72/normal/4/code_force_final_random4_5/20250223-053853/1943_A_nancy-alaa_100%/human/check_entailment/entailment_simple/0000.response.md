### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob should always pick the smallest integer that appears more than once in `a` to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If there are no integers that appear exactly once, Alice should pick the smallest integer that appears more than once.
   - If there are no integers that appear more than once, Bob should pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track the first occurrence of a unique integer.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n`:
     - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop (this is the MEX).
     - If `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` by checking the smallest integer that is not present in `a`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the smallest integer that appears exactly once is picked by Alice, and the next smallest integer that appears exactly once is picked by Bob.
   - The logic of setting `first` to `True` ensures that Alice and Bob's optimal strategies are followed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers in `a` are unique.
   - It also handles the case where all integers in `a` are the same.
   - The program ensures that the MEX is correctly computed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and computes the MEX of the array `c` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
