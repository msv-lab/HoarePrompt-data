The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is expected to handle input and output internally. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of colors available, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively. The function returns the result for each test case, which is the optimal way to repaint the ribbon parts to maximize the number of contiguous parts of the same color.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and handles input and output internally. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of parts of a ribbon (`n`), the number of colors available (`m`), and the number of parts Bob can repaint (`k`). For each test case, it returns the optimal way to repaint the ribbon parts to maximize the number of contiguous parts of the same color.**
