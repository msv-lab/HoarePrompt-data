Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged, and the variable `container` is now set to 0.
