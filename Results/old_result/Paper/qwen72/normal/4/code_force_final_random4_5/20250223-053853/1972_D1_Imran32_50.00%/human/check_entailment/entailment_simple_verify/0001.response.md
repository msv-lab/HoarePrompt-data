### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
     - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
     - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (which should be \( m \) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \( n \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( n \) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \( i \) in the iteration, it calculates `cnt` as \( i \times i \).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Variable Naming**: The variable \( k \) in the function `func_1()` should be \( m \) to match the problem statement.
   - **Logic for Counting Pairs**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The expression \((n + i) // cnt\) does not correspond to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly count the pairs, we need to iterate over all possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) and check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - A more efficient approach would be to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) to reduce the number of iterations.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **State of the Program Before Function Call**: The function should take two parameters, \( n \) and \( m \), which are positive integers such that \( 1 \le n, m \le 2 \times 10^6 \). However, the function `func_1()` reads \( n \) and \( k \) instead of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - **State Inside the Function**:
     - `ans` is initialized to \( n \).
     - `root` is calculated as \( \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1 \).
     - The loop iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
     - For each \( i \), `cnt` is calculated as \( i \times i \).
     - `ans` is updated by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
     - **State After the Loop**: `ans` is equal to the initial value of \( n \) plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) for all \( i \) in the range from 2 to `root` (inclusive). This does not match the required condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The variable naming issue and the incorrect logic for counting pairs make the program incorrect.
