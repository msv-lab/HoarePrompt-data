The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m). If `b` is 0, it returns a tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the second value from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`, the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second values from the recursive call, respectively, and `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`), and the third value from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The final state of the program is that the function returns a tuple of three values, which are the results of the recursive calls and the specified arithmetic operations.
