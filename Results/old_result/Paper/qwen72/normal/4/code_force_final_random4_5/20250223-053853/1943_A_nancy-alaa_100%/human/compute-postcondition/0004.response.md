Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then prints the smallest integer `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n) that is not present in the list `a`. If all integers from 0 to n are present, it prints the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in the list `a` after the first such integer has been found. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function exits, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output. **
