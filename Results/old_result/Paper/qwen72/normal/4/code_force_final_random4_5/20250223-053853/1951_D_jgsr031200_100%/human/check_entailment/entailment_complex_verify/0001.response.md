### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check (n == k):**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` equals `k`. It prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (1). This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - This part of the code is correct.

2. **Insufficient Coins (n < k):**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k`. It prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - This part of the code is also correct.

3. **Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The program always sets up exactly two stalls with specific prices:
     - The first stall's price is `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall. This is because the price is set such that Alice can only afford one jewel (since `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1`).
     - The second stall's price is 1, which ensures that Alice can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
   - This approach is not always optimal or correct. For example, if `k` is 1 and `n` is any value, the program should set up a single stall with a price of `n` coins. However, the current logic always sets up two stalls, which is unnecessary in this case.

4. **Calculation of `h`:**
   - The variable `h` is used to keep track of the total number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - The code calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates `h` accordingly.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the prices of the two stalls.
   - This part of the code is logically flawed because it always assumes two stalls are needed, which is not always the case.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct when the program prints "YES" or "NO". However, the logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is incorrect.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve setting up the minimum number of stalls required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            print(n)
        else:
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Initial Check (n < k):**
  - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy enough jewels.
- **Single Stall (k == 1):**
  - If `k` is 1, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of `n` coins. Alice will buy exactly one jewel.
- **Two Stalls (k > 1):**
  - If `k` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls:
    - The first stall's price is `n - k + 1`, ensuring Alice buys one jewel.
    - The second stall's price is 1, ensuring Alice buys the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

### Final Correctness:
The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is 1 and `n` is any value. It always sets up two stalls, which is unnecessary in this case.

Final: **False**
