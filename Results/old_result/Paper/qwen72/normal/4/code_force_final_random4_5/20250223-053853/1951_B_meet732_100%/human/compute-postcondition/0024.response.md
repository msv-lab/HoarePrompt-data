Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns one of the following values based on the conditions:**

- **Case_1:** If `n` is not defined, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** If `k` is defined, the function returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3:** If `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`, the function returns the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1.
- **Case_4:** If `k` is an index in the list `a`, `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case_5:** If `x = a[k]`, the first element of `ind` is 0, the second element of `ind` is greater than 0, and `k` is an index in `a`, the function returns the smaller of these two values: the second element of `ind` minus 1 or `k` minus 1.
- **Case_6:** If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, and `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- **Case_7:** If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
