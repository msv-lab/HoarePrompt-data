Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n - 1]`.
- `a` is a list of the last `n` integers from `data`.
- `data` is unchanged.
- `idx` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `t` and `n`**:
   - `t` is the first element of the list `data`.
   - `n` is the element at the position `idx - n - 1` in the list `data`.

2. **Calculating `idx`**:
   - `idx` is calculated as `1 + t * (n + 1)`.
   - This means `idx` is the index in `data` where the next block of `n` integers starts after the first block.

3. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of the last `n` integers from `data`.
   - This implies that `a` is a subset of `data` containing the last `n` elements.

4. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list containing `t` results.
   - Each result in `results` is the output of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers.
   - The list of `n` integers for each result is derived from `data` starting from the index `1 + i * (n + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.

5. **What `print('\n'.join(results))` does**:
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - The `print` function then outputs this concatenated string.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the results of `func_1` applied to `t` lists of `n` integers, each result on a new line. Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `data` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_t] (where each result_i is the output of func_1 applied to a list of n integers from data)**
