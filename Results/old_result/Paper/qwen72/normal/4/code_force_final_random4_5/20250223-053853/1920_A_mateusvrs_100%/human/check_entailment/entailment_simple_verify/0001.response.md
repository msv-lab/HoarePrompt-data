### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Values:**
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid values for `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization of `ax` and `bx`:**
  - `ax` is initialized to 1000000007, which is a large enough value to ensure that any valid type 2 constraint will reduce it.
  - `bx` is initialized to -1, which is a small enough value to ensure that any valid type 1 constraint will increase it.
  - These initializations are appropriate and ensure that the range `[bx, ax]` is correctly determined.

- **Processing Constraints:**
  - Type 1 constraints (k >= x) are correctly handled by updating `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
  - Type 2 constraints (k <= x) are correctly handled by updating `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
  - Type 3 constraints (k != x) are correctly handled by adding `x` to the set `cx`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The check `if bx > ax` is correct. If the minimum value `bx` is greater than the maximum value `ax`, it is impossible to find any valid `k`, and the function appends 0 to the result list `r`.

- **Counting Valid Values:**
  - The function correctly counts the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` using the variable `tmp`.
  - The formula `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is correct for calculating the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all types of constraints, checks for feasibility, and counts the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem description.
