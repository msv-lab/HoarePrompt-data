Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The loop has completed its iterations, and the final values of `s1`, `t1`, and `cnt` are calculated based on the input strings `s` and `t` for each test case. The output for each test case is printed based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
