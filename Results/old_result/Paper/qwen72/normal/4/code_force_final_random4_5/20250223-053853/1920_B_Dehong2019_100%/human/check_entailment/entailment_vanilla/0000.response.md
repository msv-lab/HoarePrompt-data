### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `ans1`.

3. **Bob's Optimal Moves:**
   - Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by -1. The program attempts to simulate this by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from `ans1` for the first `x` elements. This is because multiplying an element by -1 and then adding it to the sum is equivalent to subtracting twice the element from the initial sum.

4. **Alice's Optimal Moves:**
   - Alice can remove at most `k` elements. The program iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds them back to `ans1` (since removing them would decrease the sum).
   - If the index `i + x` is within the bounds of the array, the program subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1` to simulate Bob's moves after Alice's removal.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum possible sum `ans2` after each iteration.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum possible sum `ans2` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array in descending order ensures that Alice removes the largest elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.
  - Bob will then multiply the smallest elements by -1, which is optimal for minimizing the sum.

- **Bob's Moves:**
  - The program correctly simulates Bob's moves by subtracting `2 * a[i]` for the first `x` elements.

- **Alice's Moves:**
  - The program correctly simulates Alice's moves by adding back the largest `k` elements and adjusting for Bob's subsequent moves.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `k` or `x` are equal to `n` by ensuring that the indices do not go out of bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice and Bob's optimal moves. It correctly handles the input and output format, and the logic for calculating the maximum possible sum after the game is played optimally by both players.

### Correctness:
**True**
