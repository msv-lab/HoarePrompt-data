The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers representing the scores of the three players after all the games, with the constraint that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a string indicating the outcome based on the scores of the players.
