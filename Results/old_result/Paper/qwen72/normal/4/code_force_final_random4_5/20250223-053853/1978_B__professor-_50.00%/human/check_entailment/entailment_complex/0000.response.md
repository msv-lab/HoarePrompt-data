### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Condition 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
     - This condition is correctly handled and the output is correct.
   
   - **Condition 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
     - This formula is correct for the sum of the first `n` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   
   - **Condition 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The formula used is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`, but this is incorrect. The correct formula should be `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

### Correctness:
- The first two conditions are correctly handled.
- The third condition has a mistake in the formula used to calculate the profit.

### Correct Formula for the Third Condition:
The correct formula for the third condition should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \times (b - a)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k + 1) * k / 2 + a * (n - k)))
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
