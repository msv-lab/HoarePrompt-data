### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a good approach because Alice will want to remove the smallest elements (which are at the end of the sorted array) to maximize the sum, and Bob will want to multiply the largest elements by -1 (which are at the beginning of the sorted array) to minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the array `a`.

4. **Bob's Moves:**
   - The program then simulates Bob's moves by subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements from `ans1`. This is because Bob will multiply the largest `x` elements by -1, effectively subtracting their values twice from the initial sum.

5. **Alice's Moves:**
   - The program then simulates Alice's moves by adding the value of the first `k` elements to `ans1` and subtracting twice the value of the `i + x`-th element (if it exists) from `ans1`. This is intended to simulate Alice removing the smallest `k` elements and Bob then multiplying the next `x` elements by -1.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after each iteration. However, `ans2` is always set to `ans1` before the loop, so this step is redundant and can be simplified.

### Issues:
- **Redundant `ans2` Calculation:**
  - The variable `ans2` is set to `ans1` before the loop and is never updated. The `max(ans1, ans2)` will always return `ans1` because `ans2` is always equal to `ans1` at that point. This can be simplified by removing `ans2` and just printing `ans1`.

- **Incorrect Logic for Alice's Moves:**
  - The logic for Alice's moves is flawed. Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements, not the largest ones. The current implementation adds the largest `k` elements to `ans1`, which is incorrect. Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum.

### Corrected Logic:
- **Alice's Moves:**
  - Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements from the array. This can be done by slicing the array to remove the last `k` elements after sorting in descending order.
- **Bob's Moves:**
  - Bob should multiply the largest `x` elements by -1. This can be done by subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements from the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[:n-k]
        
        # Bob multiplies the largest x elements by -1
        for i in range(x):
            if i < len(a):
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        ans = sum(a)
        
        print(ans)
```
