Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to determine the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob have played their respective parts. Alice can remove up to `k` elements to maximize the sum, and Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The solution needs to consider both players' optimal strategies.

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation operations.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Alice and Bob**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum, but only after Alice has removed her elements.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` is responsible for calculating the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and the sum of the last `x` elements `s2`.
   - It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `x` elements to `pos`.
   - It then iterates over the number of removals `i` from 1 to `k`:
     - For each removal, it subtracts the smallest element from the sum `s` and updates `s2` accordingly.
     - If the number of negations plus the number of removals is within the bounds of the array, it adds the next smallest element to `s2`.
     - It appends the updated sum minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the maximum sum after Alice and Bob have played optimally, which is correctly printed by `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
