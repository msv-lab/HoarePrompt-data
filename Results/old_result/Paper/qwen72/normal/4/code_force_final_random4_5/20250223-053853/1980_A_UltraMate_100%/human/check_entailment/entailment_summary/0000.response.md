Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not appear in the string `s`), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` problems of that difficulty level are needed.
   - If a difficulty level `i` is in the `Counter` but appears fewer than `m` times, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of that difficulty level.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`):
     - The string `s` contains 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', but not 'A', 'F'.
     - Therefore, 2 additional problems are needed: one 'A' and one 'F'.
   - For the second test case (`n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`):
     - The string `s` contains 'B' (2 times), 'G' (1 time), 'E' (1 time), 'C' (2 times), 'D' (2 times), but not 'A', 'F'.
     - Therefore, 5 additional problems are needed: one 'G', one 'E', one 'A', and two 'F'.
   - For the third test case (`n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`):
     - The string `s` contains 'B' (2 times), 'C' (1 time), 'D' (1 time), 'E' (1 time), 'F' (2 times), 'G' (2 times), but not 'A'.
     - Therefore, 1 additional problem is needed: one 'A'.

The program's logic and output match the problem description and the provided examples.
