### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to keep track of disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS for Connected Components**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The function correctly marks disks as visited and appends their indices to the `nodes` list.
   - It checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii, which is a correct approach.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated for each connected disk `j` as follows:
     - `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`
     - `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`
   - These updates are intended to ensure that the sum of the radii changes in a way that maintains tangency.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
   - The initial values for `coef0` and `coef1` are set to 0 and 1, respectively, for the starting disk of each connected component.
   - The updates to `coef0` and `coef1` are designed to maintain the tangency condition and ensure that the sum of the radii can be adjusted.

4. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After the DFS for a connected component, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in that component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it means that it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The variable `ok` is used to track if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `ok` is `True` after processing all connected components, the program prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Tangency Check**: The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.
- **Coefficient Update**: The coefficient updates are designed to ensure that the new radii maintain tangency while potentially reducing the sum of all radii. However, the specific logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` needs to be carefully examined to ensure it correctly models the problem.
- **Connected Components**: The program correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks using DFS.
- **Sum of Coefficients**: The sum of `coef1` being non-zero is a valid condition to determine if the radii can be changed to strictly decrease the sum. This is because a non-zero sum of `coef1` indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the total sum decreases.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- The `dfs` function correctly identifies and processes all disks that are tangent to the starting disk `i`.
- The updates to `coef0` and `coef1` are consistent with the idea of maintaining tangency while adjusting the radii.
- The program correctly checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the radii to be adjusted to strictly decrease the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
