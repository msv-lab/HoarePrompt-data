The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates under the context of multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided context, but it is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), and the total number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 100). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
