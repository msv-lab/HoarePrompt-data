#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is the length of the permutation p.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)
    return input()
    #The program returns the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are non-negative integers less than the length of a permutation `p`. It prints a query string in the format `? a b c d` and then returns the user input as a string. After the function concludes, the user input is the final state of the program.
