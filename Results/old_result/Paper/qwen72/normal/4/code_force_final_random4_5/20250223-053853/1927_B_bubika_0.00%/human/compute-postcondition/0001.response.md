Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros.** 

The list `b` is initialized to contain 26 zeros, representing the count of each letter in the alphabet. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
