The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the condition that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30 should still hold true as it is part of the function's input requirements.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
