You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the actual implementation should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `i` will have the value `tests - 1` after the loop finishes executing all iterations. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It processes these test cases and returns the result of the processing, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
