Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in `s1` is '>'**

Explanation:
- The list comprehension iterates over each character in `s1` and checks if the character is '>'.
- If the character is '>', it adds the 1-based index (i.e., `i + 1`) to the list `pre`.
- Therefore, `pre` will contain the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`.
- The values of `s1` and `n` remain unchanged.
