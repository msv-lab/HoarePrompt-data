Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations (burles) required to make all elements of the array equal. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case directly. After processing all test cases, the function has consumed all input and printed the results, leaving no relevant state in the variables used for computation. **
