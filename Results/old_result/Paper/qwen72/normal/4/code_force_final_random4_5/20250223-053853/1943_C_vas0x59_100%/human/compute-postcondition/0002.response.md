To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(n - 1):
```
- The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer value read from the standard input.
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.

### Adjustments Needed
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `_` is not relevant to the state before the loop starts, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- The list `u2vs` is already defined as a list of `n` empty lists, which is consistent with the loop head.

### Final State
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
