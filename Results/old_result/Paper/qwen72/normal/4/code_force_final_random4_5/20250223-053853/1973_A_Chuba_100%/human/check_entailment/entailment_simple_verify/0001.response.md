Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct and necessary to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score of all players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have gained without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all those games.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the remaining points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points (1 for each player).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
   - This output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), correctly outputting `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 1`), correctly outputting `-1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the total score is 0, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the total score is 2, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the total score is 3, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total score is 4, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total score is 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total score is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

However, let's re-evaluate the formula for the maximum number of draws:
- The formula `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is intended to find the maximum points that the highest-scoring player could have gained without any draws. This is correct.
- The formula then subtracts this value from the total score and divides by 2 to get the number of draws. This is also correct.

But, we need to ensure that the remaining points (after subtracting the maximum non-draw points) can be distributed as draws. Specifically, the remaining points should be even and non-negative.

Let's check the edge cases again:
- For `3 3 3`, the total score is 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1` (correct).
- For `1 1 10`, the total score is 12, which is even. The formula calculates:
  \[
  \text{result} = \left( 1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) \right) // 2 = \left( 12 - 8 \right) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2
  \]
  This is incorrect because the scores `1 1 10` cannot be achieved with 2 draws and the remaining points.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the remaining points can be distributed as draws. Specifically, the remaining points should be even and non-negative, and the scores should be consistent with the number of draws.

Let's correct the formula:
- If the total score is even, we need to check if the remaining points can be distributed as draws:
  \[
  \text{remaining\_points} = \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]})
  \]
  - If `remaining_points` is even and non-negative, the number of draws is `remaining_points // 2`.
  - Otherwise, the scores are inconsistent, and we should print `-1`.

Here is the corrected program:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            remaining_points = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])
            if remaining_points % 2 == 0 and remaining_points >= 0:
                result = remaining_points // 2
                print(result)
            else:
                print('-1')
```

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly cases where the remaining points cannot be distributed as draws. The corrected program ensures that the remaining points are even and non-negative, which is necessary for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game.
