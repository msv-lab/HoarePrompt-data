You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it prints the smallest integer `i` that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once in `arr` after the first such integer has been found. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case, and `first` is used to track the first occurrence of a unique integer. After all iterations, the initial state of the function remains unchanged, except that the output for each test case has been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by removing it from `a` if it is present.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n` to find the MEX of `c`.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program checks if an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` `mpp`. If it is not, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, which is the correct MEX.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is `1`, the program checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The `first` flag is used to track if Alice has already picked an element that is unique in `arr`.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice will always pick the smallest unique element first to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always pick the smallest unique element if it is available to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick, ensuring the optimal play for both players.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are unique and the case where some elements are repeated.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the final MEX of the array `c`. It efficiently finds the smallest missing integer or the smallest unique integer that Alice can pick, ensuring the correct final score.

### Correctness:
**True**
