The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not explicitly described, but it is expected to return a result based on these input values.

Since the function signature does not include any parameters, and the output is not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes these values internally or through external means (e.g., reading from a file, user input, or another function) and returns a result based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**
