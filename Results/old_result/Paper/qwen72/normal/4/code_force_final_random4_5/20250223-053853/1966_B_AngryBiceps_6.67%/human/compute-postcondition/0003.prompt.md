You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an n x m grid represented as a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B' indicating the colors of the grid's squares. The values of n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed 'NO' if the first row or the first column contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row or the last column, respectively. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop are undefined as they are overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing an n x m grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It processes each grid and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
