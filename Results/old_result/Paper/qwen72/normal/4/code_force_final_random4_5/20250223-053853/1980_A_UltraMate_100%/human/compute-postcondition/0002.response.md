Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the integer `n` and `m` have been read from input, the string `s` has been processed, and the integer `ans` has been calculated and printed. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `ans` are reset for each iteration of the loop. The string `p` remains 'ABCDEFG', and the input integer `t` is unchanged.**
