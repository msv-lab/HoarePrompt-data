The function `func` should be modified to accept six parameters: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These parameters are positive integers. `h` and `w` represent the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` represent the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w). It is guaranteed that the initial positions do not coincide (x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b). The function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.

The function returns a string indicating the winner of the game, which can be either "Alice" or "Bob", based on the initial positions of the chips and the rules of the game.

Functionality: **The function accepts six parameters: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It returns "Alice" if Alice wins the game, and "Bob" if Bob wins the game, based on the initial positions and the rules of the game.**
