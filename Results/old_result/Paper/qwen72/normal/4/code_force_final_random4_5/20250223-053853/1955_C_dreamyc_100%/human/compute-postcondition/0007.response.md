The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables and conditions provided (`k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`, `ans`, `s_a`, `s_b`) do not affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
