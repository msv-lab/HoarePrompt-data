Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n == k` and `m > 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n == k` and `m > 1`, Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation will print 'NO' for this case, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 2 5
```
The program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, and Bob cannot repaint all parts to have the same color even if he repaints all 5 parts.
