Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered in its complement form (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` in its complement form and the value is the count of how many times its complement has been encountered minus the count of how many times the integer itself has been encountered.**
