Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements, with the last element being `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers.**
