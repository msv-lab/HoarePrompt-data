### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - **Type 2**: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

3. **Maximum Sum**: The maximum sum of all elements in the matrix is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values. The highest possible value for each element is \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements in the matrix. Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1)) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the sum:
     \[
     i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1) = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - The sum of \( 2i^2 \) from 2 to \( n \) is:
     \[
     2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - The sum of \( i \) from 2 to \( n \) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Combining these, the formula for the sum is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This is not equal to \( n^3 \), which is the correct maximum sum.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program generates \( n \) operations of Type 1 and \( n \) operations of Type 2.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - It prints a Type 1 operation for row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - It prints a Type 2 operation for column \( n - j + 1 \) with the same permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Effect of Operations**:
   - The operations fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in both rows and columns.
   - This results in a matrix where each row and each column contains the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of each row is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) rows, so the total sum is:
     \[
     n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This is not equal to \( n^3 \), which is the correct maximum sum.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for all potential cases. The formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect, and the operations generated do not result in the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
