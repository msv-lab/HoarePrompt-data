Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of special characters `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO'. According to the problem, a string with an odd number of special characters cannot be constructed because each special character must have exactly one matching neighbor, and this would require an even number of such characters.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function prints 'YES' and constructs a string that meets the criteria. The pattern used is alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB', and each 'A' and 'B' will be a special character.

4. **String Length**: The function constructs a string of length `n`, which is within the allowed length of 200. This is correct because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and the string length is exactly `n`.

5. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern construction logic is correct. The loop iterates `n // 2` times, appending 'A' and 'B' alternately to the `pattern` list. This ensures that the resulting string has exactly `n` special characters.

6. **Output Format**: The function prints the output in the correct format as specified in the problem description. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is odd, and 'YES' followed by the constructed string if `n` is even.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements of the problem and behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
