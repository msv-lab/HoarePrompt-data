Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it processes the arrays `a` and `b`. Specifically, the slicing of `b` is incorrect. The line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` should be `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:n]` because `b` should only contain the first `n` elements after sorting in descending order, not the first `m` elements.

Additionally, the logic for selecting the elements from `b` to maximize the difference `D` is flawed. The program should always try to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa to maximize the absolute differences. However, the current logic does not always achieve this.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
1 2 3 4
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
10
```
However, the program will output:
```
8
```
This is because the program incorrectly pairs the elements, leading to a suboptimal solution. The correct approach would be to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa, which would yield the maximum difference.
