The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `func` and `test_cases` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
