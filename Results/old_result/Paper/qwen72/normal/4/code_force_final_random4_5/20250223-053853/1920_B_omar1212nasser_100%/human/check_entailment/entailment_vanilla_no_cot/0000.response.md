Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in the way it handles the removal and negation of elements. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly account for the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. This is because removing smaller elements has a lesser impact on the total sum compared to removing larger elements.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob should multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This is because negating smaller elements will have a lesser negative impact on the total sum compared to negating larger elements.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Sorting and Removal**:
   - The code sorts the array `a` but then incorrectly removes elements from the end of the array. Instead, Alice should remove elements from the beginning of the sorted array to maximize the sum.

2. **Negation Logic**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the sum of the elements to be negated. It should consider the smallest remaining elements after Alice's removals.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order.

2. **Remove Elements**:
   - Remove the smallest `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.

3. **Negate Elements**:
   - Negate the smallest `x` elements from the remaining array to minimize the sum.

4. **Calculate the Final Sum**:
   - Calculate the sum of the remaining elements after the removals and negations.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Remove the smallest k elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Negate the smallest x elements
    for i in range(min(negatives, len(elements))):
        elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Calculate the final sum
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Removal**:
   - The smallest `k` elements are removed using slicing: `elements = elements[removals:]`.

3. **Negation**:
   - The smallest `x` elements from the remaining array are negated using a loop: `elements[i] = -elements[i]`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum of the array is calculated using `sum(elements)`.

This approach ensures that both Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final sum is correctly computed.
