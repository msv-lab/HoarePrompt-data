Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1. If `i` is 0, meaning `x` is 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x` minus 2 raised to the power of `i - 1`, `subseq_lens` contains the value `i - 1`, and `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`.**
