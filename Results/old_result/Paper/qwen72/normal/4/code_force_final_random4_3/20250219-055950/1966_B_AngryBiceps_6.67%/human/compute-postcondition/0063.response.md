The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list containing one user input string; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`; `i` is 1**
