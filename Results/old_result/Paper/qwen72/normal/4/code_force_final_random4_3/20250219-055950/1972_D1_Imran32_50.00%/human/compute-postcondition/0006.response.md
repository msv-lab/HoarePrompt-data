To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given program state and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 2
- `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1
- `cnt` is 4
- `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, root + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `root`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `root + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- **Next Iteration**: The loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
  - Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- **Condition Check**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 3) is less than `root + 1`.
  - This means `root + 1` must be greater than 3, or `root` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 3
- `root` must be greater than 2 (since `root + 1` must be greater than 3)

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4`.**
