Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, the loop will execute `int(input()) - 1` more times.**

The value of `res` has been reset to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop will still execute `int(input()) - 1` more times.
