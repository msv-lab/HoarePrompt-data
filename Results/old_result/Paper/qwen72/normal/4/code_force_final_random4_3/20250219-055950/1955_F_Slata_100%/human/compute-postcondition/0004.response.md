Output State: **`i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

The initial state is that `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. The code snippet `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into four parts, and assigns each part to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as integers. The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is not directly affected by this code snippet, but it implies that the user must provide valid integers that meet this condition. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
