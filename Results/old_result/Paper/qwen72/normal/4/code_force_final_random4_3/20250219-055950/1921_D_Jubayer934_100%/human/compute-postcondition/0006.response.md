To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, and `n` should be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `temp` is -1.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
