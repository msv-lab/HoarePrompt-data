The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the set `ans`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ans` is a non-empty set.
- `q` is the second element in `ans`.
- Depending on the value of `c`, `temp` contains an additional element which is either `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the set `ans` must still be non-empty, and `q` must be the next element in `ans` after the second element. Since the loop iterates over the elements of `ans`, the next element will be the third element in `ans`.

State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`.**
