The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and `a` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
