Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is already reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`.
- The value of `n` is updated based on the condition that the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list.
- The value `s - 2 * n` is appended to the list `pos`.
- The values of `removals` and `i` remain unchanged.
