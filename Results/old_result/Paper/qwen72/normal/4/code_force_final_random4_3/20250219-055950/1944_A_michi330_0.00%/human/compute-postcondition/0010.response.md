The given code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

In the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
