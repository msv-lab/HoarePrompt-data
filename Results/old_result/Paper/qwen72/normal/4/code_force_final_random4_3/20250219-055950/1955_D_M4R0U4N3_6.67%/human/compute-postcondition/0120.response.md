Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]`, `todo` now contains `a[1]`, and the state of `extra` and `ans` remains unchanged.**

The code `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` (which is `a[1]`) to the set `todo`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
