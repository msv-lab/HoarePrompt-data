Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs; `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node 0; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `_` is the second return value from the `bfs` function, which is not used.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive.
- The list `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs.
- The distance array `d` remains the result of the `bfs` function starting from node 0.
- The variable `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.
- The second return value `_` from the `bfs` function is not used and remains unchanged.
