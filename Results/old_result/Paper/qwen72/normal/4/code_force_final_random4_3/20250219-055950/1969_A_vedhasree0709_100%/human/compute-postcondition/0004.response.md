Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.** 

The variable `j` has been initialized to 0, and no other variables have been affected. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and `j` is now 0.
