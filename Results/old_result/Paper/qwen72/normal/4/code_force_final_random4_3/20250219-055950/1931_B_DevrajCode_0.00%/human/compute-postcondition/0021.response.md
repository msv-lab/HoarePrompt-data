The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all integers in `a` is divisible by `n`.

The function returns:
- 'No' in multiple cases (Cases 1-4).
- 'Yes' in one case (Case 5).

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' in most cases and 'Yes' in a specific case.**
