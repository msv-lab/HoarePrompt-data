Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist; `c` is 2 if at least two elements in `a` are greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements greater than `x` that were found; `i` is the index of the second element greater than `x` or the last index of `a` if fewer than two elements greater than `x` were found. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and has a length of 2, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.**
