Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000. For each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. If `n` > 1, the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` has been printed. If `n` ≤ 1, `a` has been printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged outside the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop has run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user. For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from the user input, and based on the value of `n`, either `a` or the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` was printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` themselves are not modified by the loop, and the loop simply processes each test case and prints the result.
