### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`.
   - The correct function definition should be `def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the input for each test case.
   - Inside the loop, the input is read as `r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because `r` is not used, and the variables `a, b, c, d` should correspond to `x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b` respectively.
   - The correct input handling should be `h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**:
   - The program checks if `x_a > x_b` and immediately prints "Draw" if true. This is correct because if Alice's chip starts below Bob's chip, Alice cannot win as she can only move down, and Bob can only move up.
   - If `x_a <= x_b`, the program calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b` by 2. This is a step towards determining the number of moves required for the chips to potentially meet.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b` is odd:
     - If odd, it sets `l` and `r` to the maximum and minimum possible positions for Bob's chip after `x` moves, respectively. It then checks if Alice's chip can be within one move of Bob's chip and prints "Alice" if true, otherwise "Draw".
     - If even, it sets `l` and `r` to the maximum and minimum possible positions for Alice's chip after `x` moves, respectively. It then checks if Bob's chip can be within one move of Alice's chip and prints "Bob" if true, otherwise "Draw".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where Alice's chip starts in the last row or Bob's chip starts in the first row, as these conditions are implicitly checked by the logic.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the chips cannot meet due to the board boundaries.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted as "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program is incorrect due to the following issues:
- The function definition is missing parameters.
- The input variables are incorrectly named and used.
- The logic for determining the outcome is mostly correct but could be more clearly defined.

### Correctness: **False**
