The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the following elements:
- `n`: an integer representing the length of a list `a`.
- `q`: an integer representing the number of queries.
- `a`: a list of integers.
- `queries`: a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.

For each test case, `n` and `q` satisfy the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, respectively. For each query, `l` and `r` satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The elements of `a` are integers in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output for a specific test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output for a specific test case.**
