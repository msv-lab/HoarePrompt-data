The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is assigned the value `(a + b + c) // 2`. `y` is assigned the value `a + b`.**
