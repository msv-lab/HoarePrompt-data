Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer, and `pattern` is a list of 'B', 'A' pairs repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.***
