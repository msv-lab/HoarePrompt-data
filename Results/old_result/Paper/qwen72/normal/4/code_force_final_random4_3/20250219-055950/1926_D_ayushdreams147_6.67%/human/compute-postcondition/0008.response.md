Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, `res` is 1 and `count` is updated to include the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with a value of 1. If `num` is in `count`, `res` remains 0 and the value associated with `num` in `count` is decreased by 1.***
