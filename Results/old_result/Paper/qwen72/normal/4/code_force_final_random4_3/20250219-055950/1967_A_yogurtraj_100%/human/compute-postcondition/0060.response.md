Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the condition, and `y` is updated accordingly. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and `y` is set to 1. Otherwise, `rem` remains 0, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `y` remains 0.***
