Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be at least 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 13, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- `res` was initially 7.
- `i` is 2.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- `res` is updated to `res + 15`, which is `7 + 15 = 13`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.
