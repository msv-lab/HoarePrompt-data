Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `pow` is 4, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `tot` is increased by `a`, `k` is updated to `k - tot`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
