Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
3. **Sorting the List**: The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the score.
4. **Summing the Minimum Values**: The program then sums every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list `A[::2]`. This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will be the first element of the pair when the list is split into pairs.
5. **Output the Result**: The sum of these minimum values is printed, which represents the maximum possible score for that test case.

The logic of the program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
