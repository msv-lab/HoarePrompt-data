Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is the integer result of `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The initial input values `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.
- The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that no more iterations will be performed.
- The loop counter `_` is `t - 1`, meaning it has completed the last iteration (since the loop counter starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration).
- For each iteration, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
- If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
- If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, `x` is assigned the value `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` is assigned the value `a + b`. The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.
