Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
