You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It then calls `func_1` with the list `a` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is the last integer used to determine the length of the list `a` in the final iteration, `a` is the last list of `n` integers, `idx` is the index after processing all integers, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them). Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
- If an array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
- The function checks all possible contiguous subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to see if any of them match `sorted_a`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
