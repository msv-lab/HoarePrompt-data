Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `same`.
- Since `same` is 1, `minn` will be set to 1 if it was originally greater than 1, or it will remain the same if it was already 1 or less.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`) remain unchanged.
