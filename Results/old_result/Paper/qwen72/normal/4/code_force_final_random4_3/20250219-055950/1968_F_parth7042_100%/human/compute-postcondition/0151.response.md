The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(t)` loop. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` iterations have completed, and `_` has a value of `q` (since the loop counter starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `q + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`.

State: **`q` iterations have completed, `index` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`**
