Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t` - 1**

Explanation:
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is `t` - 1.
- The preconditions for `t` being greater than 0, `sum` being \( n^3 \), `i` being `n` + 1, and `j` being `n` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 is no longer guaranteed because `n` is now an input integer.
