You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, a and b are lists of integers of length n, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `i` is `-1`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, `i` is `k-1`, `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` (positive infinity) and the values `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
