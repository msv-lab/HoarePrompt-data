Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is a tuple containing the new input integers `b` and `c`.
   - `b` and `c` are updated to the new input values.
   - The parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.
   - If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state.
   - Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.
   - The conditions provided in the initial state are only relevant to the state of the program and the values of `b` and `c`, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and the state of the program.

Output: **NO**
