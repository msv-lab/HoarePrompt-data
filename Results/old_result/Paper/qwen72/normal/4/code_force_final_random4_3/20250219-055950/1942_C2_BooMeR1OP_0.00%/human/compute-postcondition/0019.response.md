Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[2] + 2) % n`.**

The code snippet `t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n` updates the value of `t2` to be the result of `(a[2] + 2) % n`. Since `i` is 2, the expression `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[2]`. Therefore, `t2` is now `(a[2] + 2) % n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
