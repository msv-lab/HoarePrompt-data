Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`.
- Since `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
