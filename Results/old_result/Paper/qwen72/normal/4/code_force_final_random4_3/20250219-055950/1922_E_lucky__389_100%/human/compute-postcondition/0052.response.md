Output State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), and `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value `i - 1`.**

The value of `i - 1` is appended to the list `subseq_lens`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
