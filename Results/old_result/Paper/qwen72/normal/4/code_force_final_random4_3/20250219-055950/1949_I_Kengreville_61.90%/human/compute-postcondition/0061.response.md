Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`. `nodes` is an empty list, `j` is undefined, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0.** 

The value of `c1` is now 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
