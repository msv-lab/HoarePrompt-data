Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
2. `t` is greater than 2.
3. `_` is 2.
4. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
5. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
6. `x` is the integer result of \((a + b + c) // 2\).
7. `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(x, y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input**: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the user. These are integers.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. If it is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the code snippet will only execute if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.
3. **Calculation of `x`**: `x` is calculated as \((a + b + c) // 2\). Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, \((a + b + c)\) is an even number, and dividing an even number by 2 will result in an integer.
4. **Calculation of `y`**: `y` is calculated as \(a + b\).
5. **Minimum Calculation**: The `print` statement will output the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Output Determination:
- **`x`**: \((a + b + c) // 2\)
- **`y`**: \(a + b\)

The `print` statement will output the smaller of these two values.

### Final Output:
Output: **min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b) (where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even)**

This output clearly states that the `print` statement will print the minimum of the two values: \((a + b + c) // 2\) and \(a + b\), given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user and their sum is even.
