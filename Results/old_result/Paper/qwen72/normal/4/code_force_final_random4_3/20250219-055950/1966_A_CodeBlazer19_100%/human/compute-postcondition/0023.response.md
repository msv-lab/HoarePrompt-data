Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.***
