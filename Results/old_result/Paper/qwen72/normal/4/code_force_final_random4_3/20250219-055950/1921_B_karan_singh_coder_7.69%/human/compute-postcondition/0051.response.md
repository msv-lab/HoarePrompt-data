Output State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 2, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, otherwise `cnt` remains the same. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
