Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k - 1) + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`. If `k` was 0 before the if statement, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
