Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least three elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` now contains `node` as its new last element, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `q.append(node)` adds `node` to the end of the list `q`.
- The initial state specifies that `graph[ver]` must contain at least three elements, and `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. This remains unchanged.
- If `vis[node]` is 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. If `vis[node]` is not 0, `vis[node]` remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `node` is now the last element in `q` if `vis[node]` was 0.
