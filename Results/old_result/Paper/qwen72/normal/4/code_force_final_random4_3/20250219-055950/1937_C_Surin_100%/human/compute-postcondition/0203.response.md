Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2. Otherwise, if `r` is not `>` and not `=`, the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.**
