### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to determine if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them.
   - The operation can be repeated any number of times.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If we can split the array into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array, then the array can be sorted using the operation.
   - This means that there should be a point in the array where the elements from that point to the end, followed by the elements from the beginning to that point, form a sorted array.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible splits of the array.
   - If any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be sorted by the described operation.

6. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
