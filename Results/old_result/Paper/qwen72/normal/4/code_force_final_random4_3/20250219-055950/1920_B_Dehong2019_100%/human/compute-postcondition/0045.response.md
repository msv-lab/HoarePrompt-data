Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated to include the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is `x-1`.
- The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain in their initial states.
