Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns the value of `k`, which represents the number of characters in string `a` that have a matching character in string `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j]` matches the last character of `a` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.**
