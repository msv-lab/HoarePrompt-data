Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), the program prints "YES". This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly the same as the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), the program prints "Yes". This is correct because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, it's impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

The program correctly handles all the given conditions and outputs the expected results for the test cases provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
