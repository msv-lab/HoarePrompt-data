To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state.

The loop condition is:
```
while i < len(ar):
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given state:
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can be ignored).
- `n` is an input integer (this variable is not used in the loop condition, so it can be ignored).
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements.
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is `inf`.
- Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1.
- Additionally, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the value of `i` and the length of `ar`:
- If `i` is 2, the loop will execute again if `len(ar)` is greater than 2.
- If `i` is 3, the loop will execute again if `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

Since the list `ar` must have at least 2 elements, and the second element is not equal to the third element, we can infer that `ar` has at least 3 elements. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ar` must have at least 4 elements if `i` is 3.

Given the two possible states for `i`:
1. `i` is 2: The loop will execute again if `len(ar)` is greater than 2.
2. `i` is 3: The loop will execute again if `len(ar)` is greater than 3.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `len(ar)`, and we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 3 if `i` is 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1. Additionally, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
