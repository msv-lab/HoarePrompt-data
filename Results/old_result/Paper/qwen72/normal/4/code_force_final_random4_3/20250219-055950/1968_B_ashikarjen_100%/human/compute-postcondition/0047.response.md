Output State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` (the last index of the range `n`). The variable `j` will be the smallest index in `b` where `b[j]` matches `a[n-1]`, or it will be equal to `m` if no such match exists. The variable `k` will count the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order. If the loop breaks early because `j` reaches `m` (the length of `b`), `k` will be the number of matches found before the loop broke.
