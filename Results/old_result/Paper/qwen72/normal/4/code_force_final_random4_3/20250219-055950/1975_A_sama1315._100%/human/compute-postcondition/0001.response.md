Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input.**

The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a string from the input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
