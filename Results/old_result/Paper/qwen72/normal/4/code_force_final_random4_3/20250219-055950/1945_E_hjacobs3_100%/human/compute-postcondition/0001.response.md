Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.** 

The variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to 0 and `n` respectively, while the other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
