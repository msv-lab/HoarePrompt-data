Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `A`. The initial state variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `A` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.
