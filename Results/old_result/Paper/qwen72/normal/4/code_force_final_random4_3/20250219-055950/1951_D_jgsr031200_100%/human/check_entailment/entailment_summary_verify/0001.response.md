### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" followed by two '1's and returns. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall if each jewel costs 1 coin.
   - The program also checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Stall Setup:**
   - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy at most 1 jewel from this stall. This is because the price per jewel is set to `n - k + 1`, and Alice has `n` coins. Therefore, she can buy at most `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels, which is 1 if `n - k + 1` is greater than 1.
   - The second stall price `1` ensures that Alice can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall. This is because the price per jewel is 1, and Alice will have `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins left after buying from the first stall.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls.
   - It checks if the total number of jewels `h` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the stall setup.

### Analysis:
- **Single Stall Case:**
  - If `n == k`, the solution is trivial and correct. Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin.
- **Two Stall Case:**
  - The first stall price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy at most 1 jewel from this stall.
  - The second stall price `1` ensures that Alice can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
  - The total number of jewels Alice can buy is `1 + (k - 1) = k`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `n < k`:**
  - The program correctly identifies that it is impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.
- **When `n == k`:**
  - The program correctly sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin.
- **When `n > k`:**
  - The program sets up two stalls with the correct prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the appropriate number of stalls and prices. The function `func_1` is designed to handle the problem as described, and the logic is sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
