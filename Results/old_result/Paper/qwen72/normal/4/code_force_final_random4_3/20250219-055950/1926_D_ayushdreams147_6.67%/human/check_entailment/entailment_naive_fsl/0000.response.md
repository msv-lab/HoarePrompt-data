Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function attempts to count the number of unique numbers by using a bitwise XOR operation with `1 << 31 - 1`, which is equivalent to `0x7FFFFFFF` (a number with the 31 least significant bits set to 1). However, this approach does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- The numbers `0`, `1`, and `2` have the following binary representations:
  - `0` = `00000000000000000000000000000000`
  - `1` = `00000000000000000000000000000001`
  - `2` = `00000000000000000000000000000010`

- According to the problem, `0` and `1` can be in the same group because they do not have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.
- Similarly, `0` and `2` can be in the same group.
- Therefore, the minimum number of groups required is `2`.

However, the provided program incorrectly outputs `3`, indicating that it does not correctly handle the grouping logic.
