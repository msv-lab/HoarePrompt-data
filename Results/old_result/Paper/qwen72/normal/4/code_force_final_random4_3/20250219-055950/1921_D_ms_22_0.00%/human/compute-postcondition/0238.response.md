Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with two tuples removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`. `tp1` and `tp2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
