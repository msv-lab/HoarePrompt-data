Postcondition: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, and `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1, and the condition `p_1 - cur > p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` holds.**
