### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The program starts by checking if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships have sunk. This is correct because if the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships, all ships will have sunk.

2. **Attack Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates `a` and `b` as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. This is intended to split the attacks into two parts: attacks on the first ship and attacks on the last ship.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each ship, updating the cumulative sum of attacks on the first and last ships (`s_a` and `s_b`).
   - The program checks if the cumulative sum of attacks on the first ship (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` and increments `ans` if true. Similarly, it checks if the cumulative sum of attacks on the last ship (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b` and increments `ans` if true.
   - However, this approach is flawed. The loop is summing the attacks on the first and last ships in a way that does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is removed from the list, and the Kraken continues to attack the new first and last ships.

4. **Final Return:**
   - The program returns `ans`, which is the number of times the cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` were less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. This is not the correct way to count the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for counting the number of ships that have sunk is incorrect. The loop does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern, which alternates between the first and last ships and removes ships that have sunk. The correct approach would involve simulating the attacks in a more detailed manner, such as using a deque to remove ships that have sunk and continuing the attack pattern until the Kraken has attacked `k` times or all ships have sunk.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk_count = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        ships[0] -= 1
        if ships[0] == 0:
            ships.popleft()
            sunk_count += 1
            n -= 1
        k -= 1
        
        if k > 0 and ships:
            # Attack the last ship
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk_count += 1
                n -= 1
            k -= 1
    
    return sunk_count
```

This corrected version uses a deque to simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and correctly counts the number of ships that have sunk.
