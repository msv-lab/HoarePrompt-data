Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop, and `rem` is the remainder of `k` when the loop broke or 0 if the loop completed without breaking. If `k` is not 0, `r` is the value of `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]` at the last iteration where the loop did not break.***
