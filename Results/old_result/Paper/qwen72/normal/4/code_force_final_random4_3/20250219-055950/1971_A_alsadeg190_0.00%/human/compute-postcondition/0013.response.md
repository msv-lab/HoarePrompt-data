The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `x` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`x` and `y` are assigned new integer values from the input, and `i` is 2. If the new `x` > the new `y`, `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. `x` must be greater than 1.**
