Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `r` is equal to '=', the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer, which was already flushed in the initial state, remains flushed.
