Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 2, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2` or `M1 - 3` depending on the condition. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `N - 2` and `i` must be greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 3, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `N - 3` and `i` must be greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer greater than 3, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input. `R` is a list of integers read from input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`. `i` is `N - 4` and `i` must be greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3` and `cur` is now `cur - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`. Alternatively, if `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
