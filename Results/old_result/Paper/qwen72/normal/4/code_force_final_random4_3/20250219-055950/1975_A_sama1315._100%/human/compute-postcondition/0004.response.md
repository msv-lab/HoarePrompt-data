Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 1.**

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `data`) remain unchanged.
