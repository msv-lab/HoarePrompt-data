The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Initial State:
- `a` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`.
- `b` is equal to `c`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `a`, `i`, `q`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
