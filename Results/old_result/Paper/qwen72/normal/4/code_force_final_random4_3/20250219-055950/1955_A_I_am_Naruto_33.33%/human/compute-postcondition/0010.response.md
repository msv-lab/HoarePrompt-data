Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input. If `n` > 1, `ans1` and `ans2` are not yet assigned. If `n` ≤ 1, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000. The variables `ans1` and `ans2` are not modified by this code snippet, so their state remains unchanged. If `n` > 1, `ans1` and `ans2` are not yet assigned, and if `n` ≤ 1, no changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.
