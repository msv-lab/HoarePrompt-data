Output State: **`t` is a new input integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is different from the character at index 0 of `t`. If the characters are the same, `cnt` remains 0. The value of `i` is 0, so this operation only affects the first character of both strings. The other variables remain unchanged.
