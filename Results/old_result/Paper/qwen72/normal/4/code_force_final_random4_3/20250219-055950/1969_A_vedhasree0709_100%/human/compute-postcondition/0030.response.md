Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is n, `j` is 0, unless the condition `l[l[i-1] - 1] == i` was true for any `i` between 1 and n, in which case `j` is 1 and the loop broke early.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (the length of the list `l`). The variable `j` will remain 0 unless the loop found an index `i` where the value at `l[i-1]` (let's call this value `p`) points to an index in `l` such that the value at `l[p-1]` is equal to `i`. If this condition was met at any point during the loop, `j` will be set to 1 and the loop will terminate early. Otherwise, the loop will complete all iterations and `j` will still be 0. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `p` (the list) remain unchanged, and `l` is also unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
