The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with two more elements, the first being the user input from the initial state and the second being a new user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the initial user input and the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the initial user input and the last character of the second user input**
