The function `func` should accept parameters for the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. Specifically, the function should be defined as `def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):`, where:
- `t` is the number of test cases,
- `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board,
- `(x_a, y_a)` is the initial position of Alice's chip,
- `(x_b, y_b)` is the initial position of Bob's chip.

The parameters must satisfy the following conditions:
- `1 <= t <= 10^4`
- `1 <= h <= 10^6`
- `1 <= w <= 10^9`
- `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`
- `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`
- Either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b` (the chips do not start in the same position).

The function does not have a specified output in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return value. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function will return a result for each test case, possibly indicating the outcome of the game or the positions of the chips after some operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`, representing the number of test cases, the dimensions of the board, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The parameters must satisfy the conditions `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`. The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to provide some result based on the input parameters for each test case.**
