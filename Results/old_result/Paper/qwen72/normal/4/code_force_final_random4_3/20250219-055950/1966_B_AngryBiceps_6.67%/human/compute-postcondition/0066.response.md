Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list containing two user input strings; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the first character of the string in `a[1]`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the last character of the string in `a[1]`; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Since `a` contains two strings, `a[-1]` refers to the second string in the list, and `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of that string. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to include this last character, making it the concatenation of the last character of the first string and the last character of the second string. The other variables remain unchanged.
