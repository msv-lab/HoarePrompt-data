Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` and `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value.
- The current value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` and `a[i]`.
- After the execution, `ans1` becomes the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` and `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans2`, `i`, `x`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
