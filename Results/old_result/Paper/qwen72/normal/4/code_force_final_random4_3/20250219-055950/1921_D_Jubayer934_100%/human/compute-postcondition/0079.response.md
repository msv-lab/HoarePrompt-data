Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `temp` is 1.**

The value of `temp` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
