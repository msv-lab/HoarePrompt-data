You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    ><<
    
    4

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

- Program:

#Function 1:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`, where `s1` consists of characters '<' and '>' and has a length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string to calculate a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents a value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program includes the original string `s1`, the integer `n`, an empty list `preOne`, and a list `suffZero` containing cumulative sums of indices (1-based) of all '<' characters in `s1`, starting with 0. The list `ans` contains the calculated values for each index in `s1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to accurately simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters in the grid.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
>><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce the correct output for this input.

**Reason:**
The program uses precomputed arrays and complex logic to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. However, it does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion of the characters in the grid as described in the problem. For example, when a pinball is placed on the second cell of the grid `>><`, it should move to the right, invert the character, and then move to the left, eventually leaving the grid in 2 seconds. The program's logic does not accurately capture this behavior.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
