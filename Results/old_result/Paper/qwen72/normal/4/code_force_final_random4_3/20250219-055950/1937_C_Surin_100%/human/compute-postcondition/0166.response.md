Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed, which means any pending output has been written to the terminal or file.
