Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `nums[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.
- The code updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `nums[0]`.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
