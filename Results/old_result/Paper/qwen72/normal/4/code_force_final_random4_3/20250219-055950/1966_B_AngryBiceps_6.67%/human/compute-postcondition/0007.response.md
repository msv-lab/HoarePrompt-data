Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing one user input, `first_row` is the first character of the user input, `last_row` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last (and only) element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`.
- Since `a` contains one user input, `a[-1]` refers to this single input.
- The first character of this input is then appended to `first_row`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `_`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged.
