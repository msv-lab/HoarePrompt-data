Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. `q` must contain at least one element. `ver` is now the first element that was removed from `q`.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element. If `vis[node]` is `0`, `q` includes `node` and `vis[node]` is set to `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]` and `q` includes `node`, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` remains the next node in `graph[ver]` and `vis[node]` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element. If `vis[node]` is False, `node` is added to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` is not added to `q` and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
