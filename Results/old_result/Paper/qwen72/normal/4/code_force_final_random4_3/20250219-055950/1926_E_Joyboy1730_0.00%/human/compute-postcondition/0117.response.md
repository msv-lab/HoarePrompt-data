Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is 0 for all test cases, `k` is modified to `k - tot` after the last iteration for each test case, `L` is a non-empty list with elements generated during the execution, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` for each test case, and `pow` is either `2^len(L)` if the loop did not break or `2^(i+1)` where `i` is the index of the element in `L` that caused the loop to break. **
