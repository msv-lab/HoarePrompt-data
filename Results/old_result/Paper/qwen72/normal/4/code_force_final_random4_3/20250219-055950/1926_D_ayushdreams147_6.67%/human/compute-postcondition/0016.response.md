The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary where `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1, `res` is increased by 1.**
