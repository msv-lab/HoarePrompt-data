Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is either 1 or 0, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated by adding either `diff1` or `diff2` to its previous value, `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap, and the index from `b` in `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, `tp2` is set to `m - 2` and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**
