Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `m-1`, `todo` is a set containing elements from the input list `a` that were not processed by the loop, `done` is a set containing elements from the input list `a` that were in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `extra` is a set containing elements from the input list `a` that were not in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, and `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` has been removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` has been removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it has been added to `extra`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, and `a` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `old`, and `done`, `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` and `done` now contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m + 1]`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `done` now contains `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, and `extra` remains unchanged if `old` is not in `done` or `extra`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[m + 1]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old` and `todo` now contains `old`. If `len(done) < k`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are the same as in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
