You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element. The transformation flips the highest bit of each integer in the list. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing a list of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits. This means that for any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x_2(i) \neq y_2(i) \) for all \( 1 \leq i < 32 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of groups required.
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of groups.
   - It also initializes an empty dictionary `count` to keep track of the counts of numbers or their complements.

3. **Loop Through Numbers**:
   - For each number `num` in the list `a`, the function checks if `num` is not in the `count` dictionary.
   - If `num` is not in the dictionary, it adds the complement of `num` (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`) to the dictionary and increments `res` by 1.
   - If `num` is in the dictionary, it decrements the count of `num` in the dictionary.

4. **Complement Calculation**:
   - The complement of `num` is calculated using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. This operation flips all the bits of `num` in the 31 least significant bits.
   - The idea is to use the complement to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

5. **Counting Groups**:
   - The function increments `res` every time it encounters a new number or its complement, which is a way to count the number of groups.
   - However, the logic of decrementing the count of `num` when it is already in the dictionary is incorrect. This does not ensure that the numbers are correctly grouped according to the problem's requirements.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the grouping logic. It should ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
   - The current implementation only checks if a number or its complement has been seen before, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correct grouping.

7. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 4 3 4`, the function will incorrectly group the numbers.
   - For the input `0 2147483647`, the function will correctly group the numbers because they are complements of each other.
   - For other inputs, the function may produce incorrect results due to the flawed logic.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required grouping logic.
   - The decrement operation and the way the complements are used do not ensure that the numbers are grouped such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

Correctness: **False**
