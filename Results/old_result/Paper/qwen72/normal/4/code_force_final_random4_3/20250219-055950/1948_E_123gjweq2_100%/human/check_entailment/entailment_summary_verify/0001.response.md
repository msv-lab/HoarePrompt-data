### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to `n` to the vertices of a graph such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices `(i, j)` that should be connected.
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with the appropriate values to form cliques.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` to be arrays of zeros of length `n`.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the starting index, ending index, and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` which are the smallest and largest elements to be assigned in the current clique.
   - It calculates `mid` and `not_mid` to determine how to distribute the elements.
   - It fills the `arr` array with elements in a specific order to ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied.
   - It fills the `cliquess` array with the clique number for each vertex.

5. **Checking the Output:**
   - The program prints the `arr` array, which contains the assigned values for the vertices.
   - It prints the number of cliques.
   - It prints the `cliquess` array, which contains the clique number for each vertex.

6. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1: `n = 2, k = 3`**
     - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
     - `arr = [2, 1]`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
     - The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 3` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)`.
     - **Correct.**

   - **Test Case 2: `n = 5, k = 4`**
     - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
     - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
     - The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 4` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` within each clique.
     - **Correct.**

   - **Test Case 3: `n = 8, k = 16`**
     - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
     - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
     - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 16` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)`.
     - **Correct.**

7. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `make_array` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`, which means it should be defined globally.
   - The function `make_array` modifies global arrays `arr` and `cliquess`, which is generally not a good practice. However, in this context, it is acceptable as long as the arrays are reset for each test case.
   - The logic in `make_array` for filling `arr` and `cliquess` is correct and ensures that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs within each clique.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques for the given values of `n` and `k`.
   - The logic and the output match the problem requirements.
   - The original assessment is accurate.
