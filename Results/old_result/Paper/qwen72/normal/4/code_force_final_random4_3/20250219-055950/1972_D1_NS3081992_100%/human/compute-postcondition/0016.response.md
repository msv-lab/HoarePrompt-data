Functionality: ** The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. **
