Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times the loop executed, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, and `k` is an odd number. If no exception occurs, the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are decremented by 1 for each iteration. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` remains unchanged from the last successful iteration, and the loop terminates.**
