To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
```

The loop will execute if the range `2` to `n + 1` is valid, which means `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `sum` is 1 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is `j` + 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `j` is `n` (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer.

We need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1, `i` is `j` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
