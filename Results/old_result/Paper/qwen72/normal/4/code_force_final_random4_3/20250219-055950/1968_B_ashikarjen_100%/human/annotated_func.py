#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, or 0 if no such matches are found before the loop breaks)
    return
    #The program returns the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j] == a[n-1]` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. The function then calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order and prints this number as `k`. The function does not return any value.
