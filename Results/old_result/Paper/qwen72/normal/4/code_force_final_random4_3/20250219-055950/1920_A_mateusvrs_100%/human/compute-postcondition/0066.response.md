The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, but `n` determines whether the loop can execute again. Since the loop has already executed once, `n` must have been greater than 0 at the start of the previous iteration. After the previous iteration, `n` is still greater than 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` now contains `x` as an element.**
