Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by following the game's rules and handling the different conditions for the throw directions. Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` (the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player with the ball).
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (which can be '0', '1', or '?').
   - Depending on the direction:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps clockwise to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps counterclockwise to the set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates the set `ans` with the contents of `temp`.
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to account for the 1-based indexing of players.
   - Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and the players' numbers in increasing order.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the different possible directions for each throw, ensuring that all valid end positions are considered. The use of sets helps in maintaining unique player numbers, and the modulo operation ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly in a circular fashion. Therefore, the program is correct.
