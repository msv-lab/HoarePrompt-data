Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`, `m` is less than `n`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `todo` contains elements from `a` that were not processed by the loop, `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
