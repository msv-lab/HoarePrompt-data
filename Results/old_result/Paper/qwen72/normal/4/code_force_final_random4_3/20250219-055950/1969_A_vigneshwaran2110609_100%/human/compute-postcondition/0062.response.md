The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p`. The integer `n` represents the number of friends, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list `p` contains `n` integers, where each integer `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) represents the best friend of the friend indexed by `i`, with the constraints that `p_i` is not equal to `i` and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers, and returns the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.**
