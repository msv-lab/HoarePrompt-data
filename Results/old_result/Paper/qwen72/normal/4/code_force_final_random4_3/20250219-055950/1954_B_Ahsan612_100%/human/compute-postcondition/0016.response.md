Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `i` is 2 or 3, `minn` is 1 (if `same` is 1).**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2. If `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged, except for the update to `i`.
- If `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is 1.
- If `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, and `i` is 3.
