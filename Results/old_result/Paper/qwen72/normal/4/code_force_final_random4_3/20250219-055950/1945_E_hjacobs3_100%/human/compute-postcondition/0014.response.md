The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `r - l > 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mid` was updated based on the comparison between `array[mid]` and `find`, and either `l` or `r` was updated to `mid`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r - l` must still be greater than 1. Since `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, updating `l` or `r` to `mid` typically reduces the difference between `r` and `l` by half. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, the state must be such that `r - l` is still greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, and `r - l` must be greater than 1**
