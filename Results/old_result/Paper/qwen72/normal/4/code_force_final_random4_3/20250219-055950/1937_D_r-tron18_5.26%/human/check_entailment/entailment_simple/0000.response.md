### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s1` of characters '<' and '>'.
   - It then calls `func_2(s1, n)` to process the grid and calculate the time for each cell.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to return the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The function is used to calculate the cumulative sums and differences needed for the pinball movement logic.
   - The function seems to be correctly implemented, but it is not clear from the comments alone if it is being used correctly in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes `pre` with the indices of all cells containing '>'.
   - It calculates the total number of '>' characters (`totalOne`).
   - It initializes `preOne` with the cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`, starting with 0.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element 0.
   - It initializes `ans` with a list of zeros of length `n`.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
   - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
   - If the character is '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
   - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for calculating the time seems to be based on the cumulative sums and differences, which should correctly account for the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.
   - The example output provided in the comments is `-5 0 0 12 12`, which does not match the expected output for the given example. This suggests that there might be an error in the logic or the way the results are being calculated.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid is complex and relies on cumulative sums and differences.
- However, the example output provided in the comments is incorrect, which indicates that there is a mistake in the implementation.
- Specifically, the use of `func_1` and the calculations involving `preOne` and `suffZero` might be incorrect or not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not produce the correct output for the given example, which suggests that there is a logical error in the implementation. The calculations involving `func_1`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` need to be reviewed and corrected to ensure they align with the problem's requirements.
