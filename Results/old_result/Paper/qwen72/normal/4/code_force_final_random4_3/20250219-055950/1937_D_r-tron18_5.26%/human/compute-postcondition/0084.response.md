To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic that leads to the final value of `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
- `totalOne` is initialized to 0.
- `preOne` is an empty list.
- `suffZero` is a list with the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all characters in `s1` that are '<', starting with 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element corresponds to the calculated value based on the loop logic for each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

### Loop Logic:
The loop logic for calculating `ans` is not provided, but we can infer the following based on the given variables:
- `totalOne` is likely used to count the number of '>' characters encountered so far.
- `preOne` is likely used to store the cumulative sum of the 1-based indices of '>' characters encountered so far.
- `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of '<' characters from the end of the string to the current position.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
  - If `s1[i]` is '>', `totalOne` is incremented, and `preOne` is updated with the cumulative sum of the 1-based indices of '>' characters.
  - If `s1[i]` is '<', the value of `ans[i]` is calculated based on the cumulative sums in `suffZero` and `preOne`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume a simple example to illustrate the process:
- `s1 = "><<>"`
- `n = 5`
- `pre = [2, 4]` (1-based indices of '>')
- `suffZero = [0, 5, 9, 12, 12]` (cumulative sums of 1-based indices of '<')

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **i = 4** (last index):
   - `s1[4]` is '<'
   - `totalOne` is 0
   - `ans[4] = suffZero[4] - preOne[0] = 12 - 0 = 12`
   - `suffZero` is updated: `suffZero[4] = suffZero[4] - (4 + 1) = 12 - 5 = 7`

2. **i = 3**:
   - `s1[3]` is '<'
   - `totalOne` is 0
   - `ans[3] = suffZero[3] - preOne[0] = 12 - 0 = 12`
   - `suffZero` is updated: `suffZero[3] = suffZero[3] - (3 + 1) = 12 - 4 = 8`

3. **i = 2**:
   - `s1[2]` is '>'
   - `totalOne` is incremented to 1
   - `preOne` is updated: `preOne.append(preOne[-1] + (2 + 1)) = [0, 3]`

4. **i = 1**:
   - `s1[1]` is '>'
   - `totalOne` is incremented to 2
   - `preOne` is updated: `preOne.append(preOne[-1] + (1 + 1)) = [0, 3, 5]`

5. **i = 0**:
   - `s1[0]` is '<'
   - `totalOne` is 2
   - `ans[0] = suffZero[0] - preOne[2] = 0 - 5 = -5`
   - `suffZero` is updated: `suffZero[0] = suffZero[0] - (0 + 1) = 0 - 1 = -1`

### Final `ans` List:
- `ans = [-5, 0, 0, 12, 12]`

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **-5 0 0 12 12**

### Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` for each index `i` is calculated based on the cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters.
- The exact values depend on the specific string `s1` and the cumulative sums in `suffZero` and `preOne`.
- The final output is the list `ans` printed with its elements separated by spaces.
