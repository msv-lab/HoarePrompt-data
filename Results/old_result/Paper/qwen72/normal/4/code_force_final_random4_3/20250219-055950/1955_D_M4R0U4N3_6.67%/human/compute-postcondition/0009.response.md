Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user with the first element of `a` removed, `done` is a set containing the first element of `a`, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0.**

The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the first element of the list `a` to the set `done`. The first element of `a` is `a[0]`, and since `j` is 0, `a[j]` is `a[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
