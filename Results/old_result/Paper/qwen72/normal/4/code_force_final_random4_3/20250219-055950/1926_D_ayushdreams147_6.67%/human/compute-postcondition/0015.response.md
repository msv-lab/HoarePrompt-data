Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary where `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the dictionary `count` by incrementing the value associated with the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` by 1. If this key does not exist in the dictionary, it is initialized to 0 before incrementing. The values of `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.
