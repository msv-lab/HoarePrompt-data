Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `q` is greater than the new value of `i`.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
   - `upper` is the first index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`.
   - The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not using any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects.

Output: **Yes**
