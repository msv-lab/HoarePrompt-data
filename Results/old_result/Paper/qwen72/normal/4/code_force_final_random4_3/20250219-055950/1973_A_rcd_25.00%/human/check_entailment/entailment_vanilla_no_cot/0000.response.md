Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Odd Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are odd. If they are, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

2. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score can be achieved by winning all non-draw games and the remaining points can be from draws.

3. **Case When `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `cur`, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly determining the maximum number of draws.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of games played and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the points distribution.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - Ensure the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. If not, print `-1`.

2. **Total Games Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total number of games played, which is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins. The number of wins can be calculated as `(p3 - p1 - p2) // 2` (since the highest score must be the sum of the other two scores plus the number of wins).

4. **Check Validity**:
   - Ensure the calculated number of wins and draws are consistent with the given scores. If not, print `-1`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = (p3 - p1 - p2) // 2
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        if max_draws < 0 or (p3 - p1 - p2) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - If the total points are odd, print `-1`.

2. **Total Games Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total number of games as `total_points // 2`.

3. **Maximum Wins Calculation**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of wins as `(p3 - p1 - p2) // 2`.

4. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - Calculate the maximum number of draws as `total_games - max_wins`.

5. **Validity Check**:
   - Ensure the maximum number of draws is non-negative and that the difference `(p3 - p1 - p2)` is even. If not, print `-1`.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
