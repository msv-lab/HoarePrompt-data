Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which means `m` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
