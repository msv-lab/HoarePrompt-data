Output State: **`path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0. `i` is 0. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.**
