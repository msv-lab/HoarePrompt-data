Output State: **`t`, `a_i`, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
