Output State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
