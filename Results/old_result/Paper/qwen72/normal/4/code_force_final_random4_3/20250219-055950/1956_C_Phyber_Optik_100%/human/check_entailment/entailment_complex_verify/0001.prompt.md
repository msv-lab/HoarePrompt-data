You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \) for each executed `n`, `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2 for each execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 500`), calculates a sum based on a specific formula, and prints the sum along with `2 * n`. Additionally, for each value of `n`, it prints two lines of output for each integer from 1 to `n`, where each line contains a fixed pattern of numbers. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and for each executed `n`, the sum is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since the matrix is \( n \times n \), the maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \), which simplifies to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \).
   - This formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Operations Output**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - For each row \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it sets the row \( n - j + 1 \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For each column \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it sets the column \( n - j + 1 \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Effectiveness of Operations**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This means that each element in the matrix will be one of the integers from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of the matrix will be maximized.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect, but the operations themselves are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

Correctness: **False**  
The program's sum calculation is incorrect, even though the operations it performs are correct and will achieve the maximum sum. The sum should be calculated as \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
