Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the second element of the list `a`, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to be the second element of the list `a`, which is `a[1 + 1]` or `a[2]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `rem`, `a`, and `k`) remain unchanged, but the value of `k` is still based on the expression `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
- The initial state information that is still valid is included in the output state.
