### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's input parsing is flawed. The program reads all input at once and processes only the first test case, which is incorrect. The input is structured with multiple test cases, each having its own `n` and `a`. The program should read each test case separately.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is logically correct for a single test case. It calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It then iterates through the list `a` and maintains a cumulative balance `container`.
   - The check `if total_water % n != 0` is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`.

3. **Container Balance Check:**
   - The function correctly updates the balance by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the balance becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is a valid check because a negative balance indicates that more water has been poured out than has been poured in, which is not possible with the given operation constraints (i.e., pouring from a container with a higher index to a lower index).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the first test case only, which is incorrect. It should handle multiple test cases and print the result for each one.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the primary issue with the program: it fails to handle multiple test cases correctly.
- The function `func_1` itself is logically correct for a single test case.
- The corrected program provided in the original assessment is indeed the correct way to handle multiple test cases and parse the input correctly.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to its failure to handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is correct, but the input handling and test case processing need to be fixed to match the problem requirements.
