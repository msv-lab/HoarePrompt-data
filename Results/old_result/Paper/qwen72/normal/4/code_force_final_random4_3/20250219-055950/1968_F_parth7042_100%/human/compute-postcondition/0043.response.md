Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + n`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` is not 0, otherwise `results` contains the strings 'YES' and 'YES'. `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is the list `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is less than `r`, and the current value of `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and the element at `v1[it1]` is less than the element at `v2[it2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string 'YES' to the list `results`.
- If `x` is not 0, `results` was initially an empty list, so now it contains the string 'YES'.
- If `x` is 0, `results` initially contained the string 'YES', so now it contains two 'YES' strings.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
