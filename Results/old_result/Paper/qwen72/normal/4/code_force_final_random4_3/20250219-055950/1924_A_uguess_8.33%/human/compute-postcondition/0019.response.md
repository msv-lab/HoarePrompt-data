Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
