Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, `i` is the second element of `a`**

Explanation:
- `x` is initially a list containing the integers 0 and 1.
- The code appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Since `x[-1]` is 1 and `i` is the second element of `a`, the new element in `x` is `1 ^ a[1]`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `inds` remain unchanged.
- The state of `inds` is still valid as described in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is still the second element of `a`.
