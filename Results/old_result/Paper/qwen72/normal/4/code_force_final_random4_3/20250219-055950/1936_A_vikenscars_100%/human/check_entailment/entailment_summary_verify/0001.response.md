### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.

2. **Strategy:**
   - The program uses a two-step approach:
     1. **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
        - The first loop in `func_2` iterates through all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
        - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the index with the maximum value in the permutation.
     2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
        - The second loop iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
        - It compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
        - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is equal, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

3. **Query Analysis:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum value in the permutation. This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\) for any \(i\), so the loop essentially finds the maximum value in the permutation.
   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - The second loop attempts to find the index that, when XORed with the maximum value, gives the maximum result. However, the logic here is flawed.
     - The comparison \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is not sufficient to determine the maximum XOR value. The bitwise OR operation does not directly relate to the XOR operation in a way that guarantees finding the maximum XOR.
     - The additional comparison \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) is also not relevant to the XOR operation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as it will find the only possible pair \((0, 1)\) or \((1, 0)\).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically incorrect because the second loop does not correctly identify the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. The bitwise OR comparisons do not provide the necessary information to determine the maximum XOR. Therefore, the program may not always find the correct pair of indices.

Final: **False**
