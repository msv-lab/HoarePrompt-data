You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing a trace. The function constructs and prints a string for each test case, where each character in the string corresponds to the character in the alphabet at the index specified by the trace, and each character appears as many times as its corresponding integer in the trace. The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `i`, and `x` will have their final states as described in the annotated code, but the primary effect is the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `s`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The program initializes a string `a` containing the lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - It also initializes an array `b` of size 26 with all elements set to 0. This array will keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in the constructed string.
   - For each element `i` in the trace array `s`, the program finds the index `x` of the first occurrence of `i` in the array `b`.
   - It then appends the corresponding letter from `a` to the result string `r` and increments the count of that letter in `b`.

3. **Trace Array Interpretation:**
   - The trace array `a_i` represents the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string.
   - By using `b.index(i)`, the program finds the first letter in `a` that has exactly `i` occurrences so far.
   - This ensures that the letter chosen for the current position `i` in the result string `r` is consistent with the trace array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed string `r` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing the first letter 'a'.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in the trace array are 0 correctly by printing a string of 'a's of length `n`.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of O(n * 26) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5).

### Correctness:
The program correctly constructs a string `r` that matches the given trace array `s` for each test case. It ensures that the number of previous occurrences of each character in the string is consistent with the trace array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
