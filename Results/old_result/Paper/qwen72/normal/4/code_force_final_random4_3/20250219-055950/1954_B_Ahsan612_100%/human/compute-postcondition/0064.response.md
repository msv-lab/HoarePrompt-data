Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is the integer at index `i-1` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 2, it is now 3, and if `i` was 3, it is now 4.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `len(ar)`, `same`, and `minn`) remain unchanged, but the conditions for `same` and `num` based on the value of `ar[i-1]` are still valid.
