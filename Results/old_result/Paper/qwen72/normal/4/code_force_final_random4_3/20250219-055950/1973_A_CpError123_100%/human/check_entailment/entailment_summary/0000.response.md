### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the total number of points must be even. Each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculation of Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of the scores by 2, i.e., `x = (a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It calculates `y` as the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores, i.e., `y = a + b`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Correctness of Draw Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of draws that could have happened is the minimum of the total number of games played and the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores.
   - The total number of games played is `x` because each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened if all the games involving these two players were draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) by correctly printing `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
