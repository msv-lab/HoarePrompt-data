Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem by determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Bitwise XOR and Winning Condition**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is non-zero if and not if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence results in a non-zero XOR.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers can be simplified by considering the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number. Specifically, the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired up such that each pair has a zero XOR.

2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - To achieve this, Eve should remove numbers in a way that maintains or creates pairs of numbers that XOR to zero.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
     - Dividing each count by 2 to get the number of pairs that can be removed.
     - Adding the integer division results to get the total number of pairs.
     - Checking if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3. If it is, it adds 1 to the total number of wins for Bob, because this indicates that there is an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, which can be used to create an additional win for Bob by removing one of each.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the program outputs `1` because the sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, which can be used to create one win for Bob.
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, the program outputs `1` because removing one 1 and one 3 will result in a sequence with a zero XOR.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, the program outputs `3` because there are three pairs of numbers that can be removed to create a zero XOR.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, the program outputs `3` because there are three pairs of numbers that can be removed to create a zero XOR.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, the program outputs `12` because there are 9 pairs of 2s, 9 pairs of 3s, and 9 pairs of 4s, plus one additional win from the odd counts of 2s and 3s.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, so it is correct.
