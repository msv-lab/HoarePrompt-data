The function `func_1` processes a single test case defined by the input values `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, along with two lists `L` and `R`. It returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1, `R[0]` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If these conditions are not met, the function calculates a value `ans` based on the binomial coefficient and the elements of `L` and `R`, and returns `ans` modulo `MOD`. The final state of the program is that `ans` is returned, which is either 0 or the calculated value based on the conditions and input.
