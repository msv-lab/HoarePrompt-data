Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is 0 or 1.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1` (but `kp` is not explicitly defined, so we can't determine its exact value).
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `prev` is explicitly given as 0 or 1. Since it can be either 0 or 1, we need to consider both possibilities.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'? 2 2 {prev} {prev}'`, where `{prev}` will be replaced by either 0 or 1.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `prev` is 0, the output will be `'? 2 2 0 0'`.
   - If `prev` is 1, the output will be `'? 2 2 1 1'`.

Since `prev` can be either 0 or 1, we need to account for both possibilities in the output.

Output: **? 2 2 {prev} {prev} (where {prev} is either 0 or 1)**
