Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the last element which is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`), and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the last element of the list `ans` (at index `i` which is `n - 1`).
- The value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
