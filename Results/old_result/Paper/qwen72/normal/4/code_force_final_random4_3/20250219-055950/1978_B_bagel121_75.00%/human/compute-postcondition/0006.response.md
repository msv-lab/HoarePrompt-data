Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.** 

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the minimum between `b - a + 1` and `n`. Since `a` is less than `b`, `b - a + 1` is a positive integer. The value of `k` will be the smaller of these two values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
