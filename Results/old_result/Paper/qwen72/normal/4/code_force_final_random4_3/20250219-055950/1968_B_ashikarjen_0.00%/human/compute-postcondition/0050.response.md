Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the number of matching characters between `a` and `b` in the order they appear, stopping when all characters in `b` have been checked or the end of `a` is reached. The function then prints the number of matches found for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the original input values remain unchanged. **
