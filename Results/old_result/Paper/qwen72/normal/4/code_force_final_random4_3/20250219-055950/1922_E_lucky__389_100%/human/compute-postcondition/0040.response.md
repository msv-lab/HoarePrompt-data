The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an input integer, and it has been decreased by \(2^{(i - 1)}\) where `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), with `i` not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still not be 0 after this adjustment.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list that may contain the value `i - 1` if `i` is not 0, and `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by \(2^{(i - 1)}\) and `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), with `i` not equal to 0.**
