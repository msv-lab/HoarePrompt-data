Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `x > 3`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `gap` to `next_elem - a[2] - 1`.
- The value of `next_elem` depends on the condition `x > 3`. If `x > 3`, `next_elem` is `a[3]`. Otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[1] + n`.
- The value of `a[2]` is the third element in the sorted list `a`.
- The value of `gap` is calculated based on the updated `next_elem` and `a[2]`.
- If `gap` is greater than 0, `gaps` will contain the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `gaps` remains an empty list.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
