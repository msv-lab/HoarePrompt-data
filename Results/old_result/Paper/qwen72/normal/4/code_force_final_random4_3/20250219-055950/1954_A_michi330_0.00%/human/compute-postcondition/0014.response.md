Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 2, `itest` is 2, and the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
