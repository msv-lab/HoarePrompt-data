Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than 0, `pattern` is a list containing the string 'A', `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'A' to the list `pattern` because `i % 2` evaluates to 0, and the string 'AB' indexed at 0 is 'A'. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
