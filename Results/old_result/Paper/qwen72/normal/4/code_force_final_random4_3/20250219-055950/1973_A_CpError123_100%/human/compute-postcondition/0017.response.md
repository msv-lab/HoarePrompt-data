Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.
   - If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or skips the current iteration.
   - `x` is assigned the value \((a + b + c) // 2\).
   - `y` is assigned the value \(a + b\).

2. **Key Points:**
   - The program will only reach the `print(min(x, y))` statement if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.
   - `x` is the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2.
   - `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, let's denote this sum as \(S\). Therefore, \(S = a + b + c\) and \(S\) is even.
   - `x` is calculated as \(x = S // 2\).
   - `y` is calculated as \(y = a + b\).

4. **Determine the Minimum:**
   - We need to compare `x` and `y` to find the minimum value.
   - \(x = (a + b + c) // 2\)
   - \(y = a + b\)

5. **Possible Values:**
   - Since \(S\) is even, \(x\) will be an integer.
   - \(x\) is half of \(S\), so \(x = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\).
   - \(y\) is the sum of `a` and `b`.

6. **Comparison:**
   - To determine which is smaller, we compare \(\frac{a + b + c}{2}\) and \(a + b\).
   - If \(c \geq 0\), then \(\frac{a + b + c}{2} \leq a + b\) because \(c\) is non-negative and dividing by 2 reduces the value.
   - Therefore, \(x \leq y\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The minimum value between `x` and `y` will always be `x` when the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even.

Output: **(a + b + c) // 2 (where (a + b + c) is the sum of the integers a, b, and c provided by user input, and the sum is even)**
