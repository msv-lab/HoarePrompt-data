### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height. This is correct.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves. This is also correct.
   - The next condition checks if `a % 2 == b % 2`. This is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases and should not be used in the logic for determining the correctness of each test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" because the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is the correct logic.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because:
     - If `b` is even, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be even (since each move either adds or removes one cube).
     - If `b` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower after `b` moves must also be odd.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the parity check using `a % 2` instead of `b % 2`.
- The corrected program provided in the original assessment is indeed the correct implementation.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect due to the incorrect parity check.

Final: **False**
