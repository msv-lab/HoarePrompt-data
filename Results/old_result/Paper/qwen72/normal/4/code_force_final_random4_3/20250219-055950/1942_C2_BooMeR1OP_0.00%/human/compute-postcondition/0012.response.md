The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.**
