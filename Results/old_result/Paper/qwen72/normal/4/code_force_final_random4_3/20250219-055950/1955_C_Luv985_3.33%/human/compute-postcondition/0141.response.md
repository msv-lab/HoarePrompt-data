Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (now explicitly an integer), `k` is the second input integer, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1, and `ans` is an integer that counts the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
