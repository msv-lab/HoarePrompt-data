**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - `func_2` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is used to read the permutation `arr` for each test case.

2. **Binary Search with Swaps:**
   - `func_3` is the main function that processes each test case. It reads `n` and `k` from `func_1` and the permutation `arr` from `func_2`.
   - It first finds the position `pos` of the element `k` in the permutation `arr`.
   - It then initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - The binary search loop runs until `low + 1 < high`, which is a common termination condition for binary search.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating a single swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation, and the loop ensures that the search narrows down to a single element.
   - If the element `k` is not found at the position `low` after the search, the algorithm suggests a single swap to move `k` to the correct position.
   - The problem statement guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the algorithm only suggests 1 swap, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `k` is already in the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is not in the correct position by suggesting a single swap.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem requirements and is correct.

**Correctness: True**
