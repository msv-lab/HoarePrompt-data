The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a new input integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1**
