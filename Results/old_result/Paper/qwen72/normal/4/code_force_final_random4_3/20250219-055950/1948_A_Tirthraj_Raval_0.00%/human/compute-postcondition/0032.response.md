Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A']` if `n` is even, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B']` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `n // 2`.
- If `n` is even, `i` is an integer that is half of `n`.
- If `n` is odd, `i` is an integer that is half of `n` rounded down.
- The expression `'AB'[i % 2]` selects 'A' if `i` is even and 'B' if `i` is odd.
- Therefore, if `n` is even, `i` is even, and `'A'` is appended to `pattern`.
- If `n` is odd, `i` is odd, and `'B'` is appended to `pattern`.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
