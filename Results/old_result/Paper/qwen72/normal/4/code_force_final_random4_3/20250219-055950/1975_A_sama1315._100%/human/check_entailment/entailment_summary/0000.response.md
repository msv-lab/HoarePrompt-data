### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array `a` can be cyclically shifted to form a sorted array.
   - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be cyclically shifted to become sorted.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that reads input from `sys.stdin`.
   - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in `results` on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes it to extract the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
- **Functionality**: `func_1` correctly checks if the array can be cyclically shifted to become sorted by using the concatenated array approach.
- **Output**: `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it meets the problem description. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
