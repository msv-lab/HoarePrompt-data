Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, and the loop has executed `n` times.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- `a` is still a list of `n` integers, each within the specified range, and the sum of these integers is divisible by `n`.
- `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and it is still divisible by `n`.
- `target` is the average value of the elements in `a`, calculated as `total_water // n`.
- `container` is 0, which means that the cumulative difference between the elements of `a` and the target value `target` has balanced out over all iterations.
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations without the `container` value ever going below 0, ensuring that the program did not return 'No' during any iteration.
