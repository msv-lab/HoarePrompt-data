Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`). If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`. Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`. If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.**
