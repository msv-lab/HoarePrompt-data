### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - This is consistent with the problem description and the constraints provided.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - **When `n > 1`:**
     - The program calculates two possible costs:
       - `ans1 = a * n` which is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
       - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` which is the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining at the regular price.
     - The formula `b * n // 2` calculates the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - The formula `a * n % 2` calculates the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - **When `n <= 1`:**
     - The program simply prints the price of one yogurt (`a`), as there is no promotion to consider.

3. **Correctness of Calculations:**
   - **For `n > 1`:**
     - The calculation `b * n // 2` correctly computes the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - The calculation `a * n % 2` correctly computes the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
     - The minimum of these two costs is printed, ensuring that the program finds the most cost-effective way to buy `n` yogurts.
   - **For `n <= 1`:**
     - The program correctly prints `a`, which is the price of one yogurt, as there is no promotion to consider.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by printing `a`.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is an even number and the case where `n` is an odd number correctly by using the modulo operation to account for any remaining yogurts.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     2 5 9
     3 5 9
     3 5 11
     4 5 11
     ```
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     9
     14
     15
     20
     ```
   - These outputs are correct:
     - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: The cost is `min(10, 9) = 9`.
     - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`: The cost is `min(15, 14) = 14`.
     - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: The cost is `min(15, 15) = 15`.
     - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`: The cost is `min(20, 22) = 20`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples. The logic ensures that the program works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
