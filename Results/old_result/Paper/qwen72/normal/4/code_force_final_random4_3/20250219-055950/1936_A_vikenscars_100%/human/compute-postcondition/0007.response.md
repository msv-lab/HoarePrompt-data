Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is 0 if `ans` is not '<'. If `ans` is '<', `max_item_idx` is 1 and `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 2, 2)`**. 

The value of `ans` is updated to the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. Since `i` is 2, and `max_item_idx` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial value of `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be the result of `func_1(0, 0, 2, 2)` if `max_item_idx` is 0, or `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)` if `max_item_idx` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
