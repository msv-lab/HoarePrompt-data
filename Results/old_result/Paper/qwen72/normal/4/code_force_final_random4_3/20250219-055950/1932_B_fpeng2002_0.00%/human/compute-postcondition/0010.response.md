The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be within the range of `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
- `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
- `x` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2.
- `nums` must still have at least one element for the loop to potentially execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
