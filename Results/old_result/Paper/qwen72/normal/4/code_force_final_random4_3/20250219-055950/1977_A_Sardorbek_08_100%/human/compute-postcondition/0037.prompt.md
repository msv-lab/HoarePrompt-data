Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif b % 2 == c % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`, and the parities of `b` and `c` (whether they are both even or both odd, or one is even and the other is odd) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the new input integers `b` and `c`, and the parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal. If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` and `c` are new input integers with their parities unchanged, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. If `b` is less than `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the program retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal. If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program also retains the state where `b` and `c` are either equal or not equal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
