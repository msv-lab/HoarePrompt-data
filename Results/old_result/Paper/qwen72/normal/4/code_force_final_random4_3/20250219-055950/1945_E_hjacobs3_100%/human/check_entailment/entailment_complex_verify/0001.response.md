Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`, followed by the permutation itself. This part is accurate.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` implements a binary search on the given permutation. The binary search is performed with the initial values of `l` and `r` set to 0 and `n` respectively. The loop continues until `r - l` is greater than 1, which is a standard termination condition for binary search. This part is also correct.

3. **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is correct for integer division in Python. This is accurate.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the element at the midpoint `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the target value `find`. If it is, `l` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`. This is a standard binary search condition and is correct.

5. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the index `l` corresponds to the target value `find` in the array. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `find` to correct the permutation. This part is partially correct but incomplete.

6. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) inside the `func_1` function, which is incorrect. The number of operations should be printed outside the function to ensure the correct format for the output. The function should only return the indices of the swaps. This is a valid point in the original assessment.

7. **Missing Two-Swap Logic**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary. The problem statement clearly mentions that up to 2 swaps can be performed to ensure the binary search works correctly. The provided program only handles the case where one swap is needed. This is a critical part of the problem that the program fails to address.

8. **Incorrect Output for No Swaps**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) inside the `func_1` function, which is incorrect. The number of operations should be printed outside the function to ensure the correct format for the output. The function should only return the indices of the swaps. This is also a valid point in the original assessment.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed, and it incorrectly prints the number of operations inside the function.

Final: **False**
