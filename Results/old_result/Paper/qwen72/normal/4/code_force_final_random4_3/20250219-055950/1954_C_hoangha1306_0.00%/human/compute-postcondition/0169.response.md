Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length and at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `kq1` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x`.**
