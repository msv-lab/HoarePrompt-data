Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `sum` is defined by the formula: \(1 + (2 \times 2 - 1 \times 1) \times 2 + (3 \times 3 - 2 \times 2) \times 3 + \ldots + (n \times n - (n - 1) \times (n - 1)) \times n\).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is the unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `n`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1, n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n represents all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
