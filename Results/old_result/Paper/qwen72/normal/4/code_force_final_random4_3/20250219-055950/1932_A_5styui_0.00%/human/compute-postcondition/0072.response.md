To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.
   - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `a` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `j` is the last index of `b` (i.e., `len(b) - 1`).

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `b` from the beginning to the end.
   - If a '*' character is encountered and the next character is also '*', the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the loop continues to count the number of '@' characters in the string `b`.

3. **Determination of `s`:**
   - `s` will be the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.
   - If the loop breaks due to encountering two consecutive '*' characters, `s` will be the count of '@' characters up to the point of the break.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `s` will be the total count of '@' characters in the string `b`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(s)` statement will be the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.

Output: **s (where s is the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes)**
