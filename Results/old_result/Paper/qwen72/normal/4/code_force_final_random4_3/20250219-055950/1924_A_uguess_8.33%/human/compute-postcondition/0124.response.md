Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**. 

In natural language: The string `s` remains a non-empty input string, `ss` remains the third character of `s`, and `cur_ss` remains the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. The variable `cnt` is not changed, but `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, which means the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is set in `cur`.
