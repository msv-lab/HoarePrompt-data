Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`, followed by the permutation itself.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` implements a binary search on the given permutation. The initial values of `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n` respectively, and the loop continues until `r - l` is greater than 1, which is a standard termination condition for binary search.

3. **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is correct for integer division in Python.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the element at the midpoint `array[mid]` is less than or equal to the target value `find`. If it is, `l` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`. This is a standard binary search condition.

5. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the index `l` corresponds to the target value `find` in the array. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `find` to correct the permutation.

6. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) inside the `func_1` function, which is incorrect. The number of operations should be printed outside the function to ensure the correct format for the output. The function should only return the indices of the swaps.

7. **Missing Two-Swap Logic**: The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed. The problem statement clearly mentions that up to 2 swaps can be performed to ensure the binary search works correctly. The provided program only handles the case where one swap is needed, which is a critical oversight.

8. **Incorrect Final Check**: The final check `if (l != array.index(find))` is flawed. The binary search loop may not always find the correct position for `find` in an unsorted permutation. The program assumes that the binary search will always find the correct position for `find` or a position that can be corrected with a single swap, which is not guaranteed.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed, and it incorrectly prints the number of operations inside the function. Additionally, the final check logic is flawed and may not always find the correct position for `find` in an unsorted permutation.

Final: **False**
