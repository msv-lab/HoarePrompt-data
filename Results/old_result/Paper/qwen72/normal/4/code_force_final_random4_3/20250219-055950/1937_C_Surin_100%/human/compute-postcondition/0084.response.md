Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is not `<`, the values of `n`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and the output buffer remain unchanged.***
