Output State: **`i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` remains 3, `range` remains 4, and `x` and `y` are still updated to new input integers. The list `coord` continues to be a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations. The variable `p1` is now the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the `coord` list.
