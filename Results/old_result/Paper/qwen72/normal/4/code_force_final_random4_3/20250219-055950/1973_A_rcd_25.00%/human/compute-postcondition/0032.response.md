The provided code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and the loop behavior are still valid but have not been affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1.**
