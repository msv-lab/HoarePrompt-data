Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and at least one more element, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.***
