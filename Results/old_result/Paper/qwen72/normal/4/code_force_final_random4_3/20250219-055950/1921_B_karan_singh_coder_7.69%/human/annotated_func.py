#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes; the second line contains a string s of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the initial state of the boxes; the third line contains a string f of n characters, each character being '0' or '1', representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        s1 = s.count('1')
        
        t1 = t.count('1')
        
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cnt += s[i] != t[i]
        
        if s1 == t1:
            print(s1 if cnt else 0)
        else:
            d = abs(s1 - t1)
            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `s` is the last input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the last `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the last `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in the last `s` and `t` differ, and `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the number of '1' characters in the last `s` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the last `t`. Otherwise, `s1` is not equal to `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a string `s` representing the initial state of `n` boxes, and a string `t` representing the desired state of `n` boxes. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` to the desired state `t`. The number of operations is determined based on the number of differing positions between `s` and `t` and the difference in the count of '1' characters between `s` and `t`. If the number of '1' characters in `s` and `t` is the same, the function prints the count of differing positions if there are any, otherwise it prints 0. If the number of '1' characters differs, it calculates the number of operations as the sum of the absolute difference in '1' counts and half the remaining differing positions. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
