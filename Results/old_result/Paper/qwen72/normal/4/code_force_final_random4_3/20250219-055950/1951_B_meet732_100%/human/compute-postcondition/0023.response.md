Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist; `c` is 2 if at least two elements in `a` are greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements greater than `x` that were found; `i` is the index of the second element greater than `x` or the last index of `a` if fewer than two elements greater than `x` were found.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `x` is still the integer at index `k` in the list `a`.
- The list `ind` will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist.
- The variable `c` will be 2 if at least two elements in `a` are greater than `x`. If fewer than two elements are greater than `x`, `c` will be the number of such elements found.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the second element greater than `x` if it was found, or the last index of `a` if fewer than two elements greater than `x` were found.
