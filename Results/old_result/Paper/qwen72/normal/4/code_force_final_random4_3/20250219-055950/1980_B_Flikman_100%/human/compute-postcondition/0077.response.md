Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `sorted_a` is a list (though its contents are not explicitly provided).
   - `favorite_value` is a value (though its specific value is not provided).
   - `removed_count` is increased by the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
   - `favorite_count` is the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
   - `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`.
   - The current value of `removed_count` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `k`, `i`, `sorted_a`, `favorite_value`, `removed_count`, and `favorite_count` do not directly influence the output of this specific `print` statement.
   - The condition that `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count` and that `removed_count` is currently 0 is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
