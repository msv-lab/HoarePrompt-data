Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m + 1]`, `a` and `ans` remain unchanged, `extra` no longer contains `a[m + 1]`, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` (which is `a[m + 1]`) from the list `extra`.
- The values of `m`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2` are still valid.
- The value of `old` is still `a[m + 1]`.
- `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.
