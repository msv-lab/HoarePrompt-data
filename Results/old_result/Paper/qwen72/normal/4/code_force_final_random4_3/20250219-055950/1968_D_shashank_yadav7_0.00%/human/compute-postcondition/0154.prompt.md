Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1` (or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0), `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `-(n - 1)` (or 0 if the loop breaks), `b` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the value after `n - 1` iterations of `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - n` (or `k` is `-1` if `k - n` is less than or equal to 0), `b` is `p[p[...[p[b - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is `p[p[...[p[s - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `bm` is the cumulative result of `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the cumulative result of `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, `sp` is `sp + sum(a[p[s] - 1] for _ in range(n))`, `bp` is `bp + sum(a[p[b] - 1] for _ in range(n))`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, and if `bm` is less than `sm`, `bm` is strictly less than `sm`. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, then `bm` is equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
