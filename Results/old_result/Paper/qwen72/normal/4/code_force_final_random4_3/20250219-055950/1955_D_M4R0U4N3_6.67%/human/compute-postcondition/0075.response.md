Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`. `m` is less than `n`. `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input. `done` contains elements from the new `a` that were in `todo` and have been processed by the loop. `extra` contains elements from the new `a` that were not in `todo` and have been processed by the loop. `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
