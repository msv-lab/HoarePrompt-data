An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. When attempting to access `a[g]` or `a[d]` if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a`.
2. When attempting to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer if the elements at these indices are not convertible to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at the indices `g` and `d` in the list `a`. If the value at `a[g]` or `a[d]` becomes 0 after decrementing, the respective index `g` or `d` is adjusted (`g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` is 0, and `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` is 0). If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `k // 2` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If no exception occurs, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1` and `a[g]` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was 0 after decrementing, `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` is 0 after decrementing, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
