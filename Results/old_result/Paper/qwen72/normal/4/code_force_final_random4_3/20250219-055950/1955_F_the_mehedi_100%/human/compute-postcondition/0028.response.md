Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the new `a` plus 1 if the first three elements of the new `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is just the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the new `a`.** 

The initial value of `a` is replaced by a new list of integers input by the user. The value of `cnt` is recalculated based on the new values in `a`. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
