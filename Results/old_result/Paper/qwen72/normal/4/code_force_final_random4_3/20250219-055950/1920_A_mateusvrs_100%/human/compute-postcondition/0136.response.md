Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
