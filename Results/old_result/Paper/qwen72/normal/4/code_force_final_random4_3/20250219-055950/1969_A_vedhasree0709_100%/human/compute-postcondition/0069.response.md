Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early, `j` is 0, and `_` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer, which is greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, and `_`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `i` is described as being `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early. Since the loop is not mentioned in the code snippet, this state remains the same.
- The initial state of `j` is 0, and this remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `_` being incremented by 1 remains the same, as the code snippet does not affect this variable.
