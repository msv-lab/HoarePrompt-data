Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p3 - 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
