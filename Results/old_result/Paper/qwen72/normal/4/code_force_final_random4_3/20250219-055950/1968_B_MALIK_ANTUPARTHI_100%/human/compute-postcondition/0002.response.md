Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to `b` and `c` respectively.
- The initial value of `b` as a binary string of length `m` is no longer valid; `b` is now an integer.
- The initial value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, but it is now an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
