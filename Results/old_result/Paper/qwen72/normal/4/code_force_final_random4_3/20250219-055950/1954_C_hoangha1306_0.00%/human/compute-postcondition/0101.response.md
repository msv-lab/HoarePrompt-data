Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` includes the string representation of `x` appended to its previous value if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` includes the string representation of `y`. Similarly, `kq2` includes the string representation of `y` appended to its previous value if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, otherwise `kq2` includes the string representation of `x`. `vt` is set to 1 if `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `vt` remains 0.***
