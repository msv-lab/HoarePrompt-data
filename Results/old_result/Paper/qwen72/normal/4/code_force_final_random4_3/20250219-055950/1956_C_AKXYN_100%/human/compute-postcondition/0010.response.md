Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 500. The variable `n` is still an input integer within the range of 1 to 500. The variable `mat` is still a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The variable `res` now holds the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over.
