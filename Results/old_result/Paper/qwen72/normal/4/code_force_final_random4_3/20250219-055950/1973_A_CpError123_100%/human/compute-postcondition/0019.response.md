Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on user input. The initial state variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now provided by the user, and they are integers. The conditions regarding the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` being odd and the subsequent assignments to `x` and `y` are not executed in this snippet, so they do not affect the output state.
