The code snippet `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `L`. The initial state provides that `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples, and `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are input integers. However, the code snippet only affects the variable `L`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer. `L` is a list of integers read from input.**
