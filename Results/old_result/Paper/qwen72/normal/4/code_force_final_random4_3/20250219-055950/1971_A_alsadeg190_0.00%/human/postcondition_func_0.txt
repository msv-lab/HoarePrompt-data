The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each call, the function reads an integer `x` from the user, and then for each integer `i` from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user. The function then prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that `x` and `y` have been reassigned multiple times during the execution, and the loop has executed `x` times for each call to the function. The function does not return any value.
