Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than or equal to `mid`), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, and `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, and the loop will execute `mid` times.
- After all iterations, the array `arr` from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left` will be filled with values starting from `small_element + (mid - 1)` down to `small_element + 0`.
- The array `cliquess` from index `left + (mid - 1)` down to `left` will all be set to the value of `clique`.
