Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.**

The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the value of `j`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
