Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 0, `r` must be `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3 depending on its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.
