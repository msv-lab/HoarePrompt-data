Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals can form a complete tent (i.e., `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`).
   - If the condition is met, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is the main function that calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each of whom requires a separate tent) to the result of `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Introverts are always given separate tents, which is handled by adding `introverts` to the result of `func_1`.
   - Extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents possible, ensuring that extroverts are always in a tent with exactly two others.
   - The program returns -1 if it is impossible to form the required tents for extroverts and universals, which is a valid and expected behavior according to the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
