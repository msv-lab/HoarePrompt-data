The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The length of `N` is reduced by 1, and `w` holds the value of the removed element.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N` - 1, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, and `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**
