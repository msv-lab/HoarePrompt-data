Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the integer 1 if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 1; `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[1]` is greater than `x`, `c` was initially 1, so now `c` is 2.
- If `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, `c` was initially 0, so now `c` is 1.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
