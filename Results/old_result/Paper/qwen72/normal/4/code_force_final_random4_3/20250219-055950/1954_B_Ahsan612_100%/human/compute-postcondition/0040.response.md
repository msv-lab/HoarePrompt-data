The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop is controlled by the value of the input provided to `range(int(input()))`. The loop will execute as many times as the integer input specifies. Since `_` is the loop counter and it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to adjust `_` to reflect the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 1.

State: **`_` is 1, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is len(ar), and minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1. If minn is `inf` or `len(ar)`, then minn is updated to 1. Otherwise, minn remains the minimum value between the original minn and 1, and is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
