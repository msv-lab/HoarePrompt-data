Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 9, `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4`.
- The expression `(n + i) // cnt` simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9` because `i` is 3 and `cnt` is 9.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `root`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
