The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1. The state of `t` and the individual `n` values for each test case are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the initial state provided. Since the loop will execute based on the input, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which aligns with the constraint that `1 <= t <= 500`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, the input must be a positive integer (at least 1) to ensure the loop executes**.
