The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters. The integer `n` represents the length of the path, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. It is guaranteed that the first cell of each path is empty.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is a boolean value indicating whether the path can be completed without encountering a thorn ('*'). If the path contains any thorns, the function returns `False` for that test case; otherwise, it returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters representing a path. It returns a list of boolean values, each indicating whether the corresponding path can be completed without encountering a thorn.**
