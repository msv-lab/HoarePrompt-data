Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, and `bm` is less than `sm`.**
