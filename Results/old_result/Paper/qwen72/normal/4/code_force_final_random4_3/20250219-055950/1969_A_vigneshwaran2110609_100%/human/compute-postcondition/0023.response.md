Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is not set (or remains `False` if it was initially `False`)**

The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, and `flag`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
