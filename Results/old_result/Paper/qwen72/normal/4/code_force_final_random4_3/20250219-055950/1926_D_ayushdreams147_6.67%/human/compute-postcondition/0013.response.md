Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. If `num` is not in `count`, `count` is updated to include the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` with its value increased by 1, and `res` is increased by 1. If `num` is in `count`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.***
