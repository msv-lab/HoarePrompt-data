Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(cast)` is used to read and cast input values. It reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and maps the `cast` function to each element.
   - The main function `func_5()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the array `a` and calculates the prefix XOR array `x`. The prefix XOR array `x` is such that `x[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`.
   - The prefix XOR array is initialized with `0` to handle the case where the subarray starts from the beginning of the array.

3. **Index Tracking**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding the required indices for the queries.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting.
   - The subarray is interesting if the XOR of the elements from `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is `0` or if there exists a previous occurrence of the same XOR value before `l-1` and after `r`.

5. **Binary Search**:
   - The functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to perform binary search on the list of indices for a given prefix XOR value. This helps in efficiently finding the required indices.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" if the subarray is interesting and "No" otherwise.

The program correctly handles the constraints and efficiently processes the queries using the prefix XOR and binary search techniques. Therefore, the program is correct.
