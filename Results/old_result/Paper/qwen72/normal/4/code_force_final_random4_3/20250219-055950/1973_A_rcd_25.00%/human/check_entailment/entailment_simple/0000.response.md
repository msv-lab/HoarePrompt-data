### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total score must be even if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game (each game contributes 2 points to the total, either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the function then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If it is, the function prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum number of draws possible. This is because all the points in `p1` and `p2` could have been from draws, and `p3` could have won all the non-draw games.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the function enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws:
     - It initializes `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`.
     - It iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. This logic is intended to find a valid distribution of draws and wins that matches the given scores.
     - If the loop completes without finding a valid distribution, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 10`) by printing `-1`.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The function's logic is somewhat complex, but it appears to correctly handle the constraints and edge cases. The loop that iterates from `low` to `high` is necessary to find the maximum number of draws in cases where `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the logic for determining the maximum number of draws is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
