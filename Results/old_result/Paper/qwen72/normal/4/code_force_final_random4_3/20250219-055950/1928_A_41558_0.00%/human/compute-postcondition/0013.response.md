Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `a` and `b` are reassigned to new integer values provided by the user input.
- The conditions regarding `a` and `b` (whether they are odd, one is exactly twice the other, or neither condition holds) are no longer valid as they depend on the new values of `a` and `b` provided by the user.
