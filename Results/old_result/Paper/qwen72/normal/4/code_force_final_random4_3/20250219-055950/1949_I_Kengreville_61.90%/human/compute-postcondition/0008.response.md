The value of `coef1[j]` is assigned the value of `-coef1[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[0]`, `visited[j]` is `False`, the sum of `r[i]` and `r[0]` squared is equal to the sum of `dx` squared and `dy` squared, `coef0[j]` is equal to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is equal to `-coef1[i]`.**
