The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing one user input, `first_row` is the first character of the user input, `last_row` is the last character of the user input**
