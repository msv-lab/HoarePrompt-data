Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the program's logic does not account for this scenario properly. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The program will output "Bob" instead of "Alice" because it incorrectly handles the case where all pile sizes are the same. The program should recognize that if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can always win by removing all stones in one move.
