Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` to process each test case. This is a significant issue because the function cannot be called correctly with the required inputs.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.

3. **Logic for Determining the Output**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is used to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent all parts from having the same color.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not already the same color (after Alice's painting) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this condition is true, Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting the necessary parts.

4. **Output**: The function prints 'NO' if either condition is true, and 'Yes' otherwise. The output is case-insensitive, so 'Yes' and 'NO' are acceptable.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint the single part.
   - For the test case `5 1 1`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because there is only one color available.
   - For the test case `5 2 1`, the function correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only one part.
   - For the test case `5 2 2`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   - For the test case `5 5 3`, the function correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint each part a different color, and Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting only three parts.

However, the function definition is incorrect, which means the program cannot be called properly with the required parameters. This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
