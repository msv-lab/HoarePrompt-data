Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is 0, 1, or 2.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1` (but `kp` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
   - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is updated to 2.
   - If `r` is `=`, `prev` is updated to 2.
   - If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains 0 or 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The values of `i` and `prev` are used in the f-string.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` is a variable that can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Possible Values of `prev`:**
   - `prev` can be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `r` in the previous iteration.
   - The exact value of `prev` is not provided, but it must be one of these three values.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output `? 3 3 [prev] [prev]`, where `[prev]` is the value of `prev` (0, 1, or 2).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is 0, 1, or 2)**
