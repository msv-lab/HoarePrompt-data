Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which is not used within the function. It then reads 10 pairs of integers (each pair on a new line) and stores them in two lists, `x` and `y`. After collecting the inputs, the function iterates through these lists and prints each pair of integers in a sorted order, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` each contain 10 integers, and the function has printed 10 lines of sorted integer pairs.
