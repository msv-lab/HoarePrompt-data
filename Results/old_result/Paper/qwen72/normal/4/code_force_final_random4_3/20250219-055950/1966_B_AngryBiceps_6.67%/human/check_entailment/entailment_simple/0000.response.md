### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B'), and stores these lines in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
     - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row, it prints 'NO'.
     - If the first column of the grid (represented by `first_row`) is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column (represented by `last_row`), it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The first condition checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row have different colors, and it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows cannot be changed to the same color in a single operation.
   - The second condition checks if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column have different colors, and it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last columns cannot be changed to the same color in a single operation.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform. This is because if the first row or the first column is not uniform, or if they are uniform and the same as the last row or last column, we can always find a way to perform operations to make the entire grid uniform.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For a 1x1 grid, the function will print 'YES' because a single cell is already uniform.
   - For a grid where all cells are already the same color, the function will print 'YES' because no operations are needed.
   - For a grid where the first row or first column is uniform and different from the last row or last column, the function will correctly print 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid uniform based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
