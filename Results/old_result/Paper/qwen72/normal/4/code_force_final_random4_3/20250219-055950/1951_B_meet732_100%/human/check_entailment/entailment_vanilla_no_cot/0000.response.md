Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the maximum number of matches that cow `k` can win, but the logic within the function is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Initial Position**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the initial position of cow `k` and the subsequent matches. It should consider the matches in the order they are played and determine the optimal swap position to maximize the number of wins.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping**:
   - The function attempts to find the indices of cows with higher ratings than cow `k` and then makes decisions based on these indices. However, it does not correctly simulate the matches to determine the maximum number of wins after a potential swap.

3. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - The return values in the function do not always reflect the correct number of wins. For example, the logic for determining the number of wins when there are no cows with higher ratings is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(a, k):
    n = len(a)
    x = a[k]
    wins = 0
    can_swap = True

    # Simulate the matches without swapping
    for i in range(k, n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            a[i + 1] = a[i]
            wins += 1
        else:
            break

    # Check if swapping can increase the number of wins
    for i in range(n):
        if i != k and a[i] < x:
            # Simulate the matches with the swap
            a[i], a[k] = a[k], a[i]
            swap_wins = 0
            for j in range(i, n - 1):
                if a[j] > a[j + 1]:
                    a[j + 1] = a[j]
                    swap_wins += 1
                else:
                    break
            a[i], a[k] = a[k], a[i]
            wins = max(wins, swap_wins)

    return wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(max_wins(l, k))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The function `max_wins` first simulates the matches without swapping. It counts the number of wins cow `k` can achieve by comparing its rating with the subsequent cows' ratings.

2. **Swap Simulation**:
   - The function then iterates through all possible positions to swap cow `k` with another cow. For each potential swap, it simulates the matches again to determine the number of wins cow `k` can achieve after the swap. The maximum number of wins from all possible swaps is stored.

3. **Return the Maximum Wins**:
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve, either without swapping or with the optimal swap.

This corrected program should accurately solve the problem as described.
