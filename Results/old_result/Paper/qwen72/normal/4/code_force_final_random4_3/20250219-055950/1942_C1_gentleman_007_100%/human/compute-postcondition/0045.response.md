The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains at least one node, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, and `q` now contains at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must still contain at least one node, and `node` will be the next node in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`**
