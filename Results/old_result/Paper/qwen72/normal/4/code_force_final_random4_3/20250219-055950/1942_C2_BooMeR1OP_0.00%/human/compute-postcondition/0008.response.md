Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `(a[i] + 2) % n` to the variable `t2`. Since `i` is 0, `t2` is calculated as `(a[0] + 2) % n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
