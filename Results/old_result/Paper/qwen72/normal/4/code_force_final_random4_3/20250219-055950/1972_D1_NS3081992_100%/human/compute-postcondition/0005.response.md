Output State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than `_ + 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value of `func_15()` is printed followed by a newline.**

Explanation:
- The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` prints the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `_` is not provided, so it remains incremented by 1.
- The function `func_10()` must still return a positive integer greater than `_ + 1`.
- The state of `func_15()` is not affected by the code, and its value is printed as is.
