You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Let's illustrate this with a few examples:
    #
    #- If `n = 3`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 2, 3]` (since there's only one odd-indexed element, it remains the same).
    #- If `n = 4`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
    #- If `n = 5`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Reversing the odd-indexed elements results in `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.
    #
    #Given the general case, the output will be the list `a` with the odd-indexed elements reversed. The exact values will depend on the value of `n`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified, but it is implied to be dependent on an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
