### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, and initializes an empty list `result` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Calculate Total Space Required**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required for all icons is calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`. However, this variable is not used in the subsequent logic, which is fine as it is not necessary for the solution.

4. **Determine Screens Required for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program correctly determines the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

5. **Calculate Remaining Cells**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons on the determined number of screens (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

6. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Cells**:
   - The program checks if the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells.
   - If the 1x1 icons fit in the remaining cells, the program appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If the 1x1 icons do not fit in the remaining cells, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space that still needs to be filled.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` calculates the number of additional screens required. This logic is correct because it ensures that any remaining space that is not a multiple of 15 is accounted for by adding one more screen.
   - The program then appends the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons to the result list.

7. **Output the Results**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of 2x2 Icon Placement**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold up to 2 such icons, and the program accounts for this by using integer division and adding 1 if `y` is odd.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icon Placement**:
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
  - It then checks if the 1x1 icons fit in the remaining cells and calculates the additional screens required if they do not fit. The logic for calculating `extra_screen` is correct and ensures that any remaining space is properly accounted for.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `x` and `y` are zero.
  - It also handles cases where there are only 1x1 icons or only 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of screens required for both types of icons and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
