You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function receives two integers x and y as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values from the input, and `i` is `x-1`. For each iteration, if the new `x` > the new `y`, `x` is greater than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. The loop has executed `x` times, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each call, the function reads an integer `x` from the user, and then for each integer `i` from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user. The function then prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that `x` and `y` have been reassigned multiple times during the execution, and the loop has executed `x` times for each call to the function. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` correctly. Specifically, it prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
