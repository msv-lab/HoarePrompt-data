The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then `n` sets of coordinates and radii for disks, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to track the state of each disk. The function then iterates through each disk, and if a disk has not been visited, it sets `coef0` and `coef1` for that disk, collects indices of connected disks into `nodes`, and updates a cumulative sum of `coef0` and `coef1` values. If the cumulative sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, the function sets `ok` to `True`. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `ok` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise. After the function concludes, `n` remains the same, `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the input values, `visited` is a list of `n` `True` values, `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros, `coef1` is a list of `n` ones, `nodes` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1`, and `ok` is either `True` or `False` based on the cumulative sum of `coef1` values.
