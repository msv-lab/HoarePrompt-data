The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns the value of `counter`, which is the number of positions in the strings `s1` and `s2` where the characters differ, plus an additional increment for each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, plus an additional count for each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different.**
