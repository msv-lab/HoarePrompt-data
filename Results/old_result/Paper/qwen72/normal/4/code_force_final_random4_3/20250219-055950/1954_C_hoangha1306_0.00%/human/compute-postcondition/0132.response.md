Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, and `vt` is 0. The first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`.***
