The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `predicate`, which is a function that takes a list of integers and returns a boolean value. It returns the boolean result of applying the `predicate` function to the list `arr`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `arr` remains unchanged, and the return value is the boolean result of the `predicate` function applied to `arr`.
