Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints whether Alice or Bob wins a game based on the uniqueness and consecutive differences of the stone counts. Specifically, if the stone counts in the piles are all unique and the differences between consecutive stone counts (excluding the initial 0) are at most 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The function does not return any values. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program reflects the results printed for each test case. **
