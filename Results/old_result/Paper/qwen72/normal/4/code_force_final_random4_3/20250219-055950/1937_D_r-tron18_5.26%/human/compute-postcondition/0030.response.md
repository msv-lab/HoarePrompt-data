Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`) is '<', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so its exact behavior and the resulting value of `zeroInd` cannot be determined.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
