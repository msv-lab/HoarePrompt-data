### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be visualized as an array.
   - The game consists of one round (t=1).
   - The stone starts on a given node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine who wins the round if both players play optimally.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input and processes it in a loop, collecting edges until it encounters a line with a different format.
   - This function correctly reads the edges of the tree and returns them as a list of lists.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The main program then iterates over the list of edges and compares the two nodes in each edge.
   - However, this comparison is irrelevant to the game's logic. The game is about moving the stone on the tree, not comparing the nodes of the edges.
   - The program does not consider the structure of the tree or the optimal moves of the players.
   - The program does not handle the starting node for the round, which is crucial for determining the winner.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program incorrectly uses the comparison of `num_1` and `num_2` to decide the winner.
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Reading the tree structure and identifying the two leaves.
     - Determining the distance from the starting node to each leaf.
     - The player who starts the game (Ron) wins if the starting node is closer to one leaf than the other. If the starting node is equidistant from both leaves, the second player (Hermione) wins.

5. **Issues and Analysis**:
   - The program's logic is fundamentally flawed as it does not simulate the game correctly.
   - The function `func_1` reads the edges but does not handle the starting node for the round.
   - The comparison of `num_1` and `num_2` in the loop is irrelevant to the game's outcome.
   - The program does not consider the structure of the tree or the optimal moves of the players.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not consider the structure of the tree or the optimal moves of the players. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
