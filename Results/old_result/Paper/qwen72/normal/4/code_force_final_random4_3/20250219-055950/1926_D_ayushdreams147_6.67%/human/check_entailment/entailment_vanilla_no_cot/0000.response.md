Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to use a dictionary to count the occurrences of the complement of each number (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), but this approach does not ensure that the numbers in the same group do not have matching bit values from the 1st to the 31st bit. 

The correct approach should involve checking the bit patterns of the numbers and ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. This can be achieved by using a bitmask to represent the bit patterns and ensuring that no two numbers with the same bitmask are placed in the same group. The minimum number of groups required would be the number of unique bit patterns (or bitmasks) among the numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    # Use a set to keep track of unique bit patterns
    bit_patterns = set()
    
    for num in a:
        # Extract the 31 least significant bits
        bit_pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        bit_patterns.add(bit_pattern)
    
    # The minimum number of groups is the number of unique bit patterns
    return len(bit_patterns)
```

This program correctly identifies the unique bit patterns and returns the minimum number of groups required.
