Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is equal to `x`.**
