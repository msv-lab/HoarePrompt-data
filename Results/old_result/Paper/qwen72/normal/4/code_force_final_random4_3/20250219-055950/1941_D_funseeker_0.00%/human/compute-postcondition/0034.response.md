Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`, the current value of `c` is '1' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`.
- The new element is the result of `(q - r) % n`.
- The value of `q` is the first element in the set `ans`.
- The current value of `c` is '1' or '?', which remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`ans`, `q`, `c`, `r`, and `n`) retain their initial states or values.
