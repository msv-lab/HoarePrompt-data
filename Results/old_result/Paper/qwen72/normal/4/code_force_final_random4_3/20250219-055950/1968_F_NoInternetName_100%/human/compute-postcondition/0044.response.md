Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns the value of `lower` based on the condition `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`.
- `inds[x[r]]` is a list of indices where the value `x[r]` appears in the list `x`.
- `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` is a function call that returns the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `None` if no such index exists.
- The expression `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0` ensures that if `func_4` returns `None`, `lower` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, `lower` is assigned the value returned by `func_4`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, except for `i` which is incremented by 1.
- `q` is still greater than the new value of `i`.
- `lower` is now the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
