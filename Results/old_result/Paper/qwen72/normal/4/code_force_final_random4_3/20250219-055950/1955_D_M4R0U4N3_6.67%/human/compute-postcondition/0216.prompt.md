Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of arrays a and b and the required number of matching elements. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`, `m` is less than `n`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `todo` contains elements from `a` that were not processed by the loop, `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and have been processed by the loop, and `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `done` and were not in `todo` initially, `done` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo` initially and any elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were added to `done` during the loop, `extra` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `todo` initially and were not added to `done` during the loop, and `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus the integers that were in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` and were in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were in `todo` and any integers from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo` and have been moved to `done`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `todo`, and `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
