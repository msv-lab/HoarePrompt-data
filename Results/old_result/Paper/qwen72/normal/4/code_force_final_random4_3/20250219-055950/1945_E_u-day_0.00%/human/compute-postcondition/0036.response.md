Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 >= high`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains `n-1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`low` and `high`**: After all iterations of the loop, the condition `low + 1 < high` is no longer true, meaning `low + 1 >= high`. This is the termination condition of the loop.
- **`pos`**: The value of `pos` will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found during the loop execution. If `k` is not found, `pos` will remain -1.
- **`st`**: The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were calculated during the loop iterations. Each midpoint is the result of `(low + high) // 2` at each iteration.
- **`mid`**: The variable `mid` will hold the last calculated midpoint before the loop terminates. This is the value of `(low + high) // 2` in the final iteration where `low + 1 < high` was still true.
