Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n` + 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. This means it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Combining the Values:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the range `range(1, n + 1)` will always include at least the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
   - The output will be a sequence starting with `2`, followed by `n - 2`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
