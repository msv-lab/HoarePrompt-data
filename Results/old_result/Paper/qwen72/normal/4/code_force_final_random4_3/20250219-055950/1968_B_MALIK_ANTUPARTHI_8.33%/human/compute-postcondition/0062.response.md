Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is a new input value, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
