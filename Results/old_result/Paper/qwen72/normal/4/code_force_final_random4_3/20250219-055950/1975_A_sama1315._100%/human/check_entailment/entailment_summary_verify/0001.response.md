### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these parts. This operation can be repeated any number of times.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight is that if we can find a subarray in the concatenated array `a + a` that matches the sorted version of `a`, then the array can be sorted using the described operation.
   - This is because concatenating the array with itself allows us to check all possible cyclic permutations of the array.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - This logic is correct because it effectively checks all possible splits and swaps of the array.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Verification with Function Summary:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` confirms that it reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed in the required format.
   - This aligns with the original assessment and the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Final: **True**
