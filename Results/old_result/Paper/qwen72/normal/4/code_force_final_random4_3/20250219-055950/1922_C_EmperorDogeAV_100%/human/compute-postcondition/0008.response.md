Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1; if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is now equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is now equal to `cities[i + 1]`. Additionally, `i` is less than `n - 1`.**
