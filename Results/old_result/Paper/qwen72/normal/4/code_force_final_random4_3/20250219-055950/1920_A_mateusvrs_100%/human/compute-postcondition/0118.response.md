Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` now contains `x`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer still holds true. The only change is that `cx` now contains the value of `x`.
