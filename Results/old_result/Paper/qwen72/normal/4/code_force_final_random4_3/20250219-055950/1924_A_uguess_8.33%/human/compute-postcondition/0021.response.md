Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
