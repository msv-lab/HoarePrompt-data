Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its previous value. Since `i` is 0, the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `1 * 1`, which is 1. Therefore, `res` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0.
