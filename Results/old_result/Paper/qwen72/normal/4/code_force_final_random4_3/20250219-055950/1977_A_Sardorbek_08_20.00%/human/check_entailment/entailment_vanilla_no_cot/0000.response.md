Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided has a logical error in the condition checks. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The parity (odd or even nature) of `a` (the number of test cases) should not be compared with the parity of `b` (the number of moves). Instead, the parity of `b` (the number of moves) should be compared with the parity of `c` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif n < m:
            print('No')
        elif n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `t = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `for i in range(t)`: Iterates over each test case.
   - `(n, m) = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the values of `n` and `m` for the current test case.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - `if n == m`: If the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, then it is possible to build the tower, so print "Yes".
   - `elif n < m`: If the number of moves `n` is less than the desired number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to build the tower, so print "No".
   - `elif n % 2 == m % 2`: If the parity of `n` and `m` is the same, it is possible to build the tower, so print "Yes". This is because the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must have the same parity for the tower to be built.
   - `else`: If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to build the tower, so print "No".

This corrected program will correctly determine whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for each test case.
