Output State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `j` is now the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `a`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The loop continues to increment `j` by 1 as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`.
- After all iterations, `j` will either be the smallest index where `b[j]` is equal to `a[1]`, or if no such index exists, `j` will be equal to `m` (the length of `b`).
- The loop stops when `j` reaches `m` or when `b[j]` equals `a[1]`.
