### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_4()` to process the game.

2. **Initialization:**
   - In `func_4()`, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `x` from the input using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates `m` times, reading the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw.
   - For each player in the current set `ans`, it calculates the new positions based on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to the contents of `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for 0 Position:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`.
   - If `0` is present, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the direction is '0' or '1' and the resulting position is the same as the starting position (i.e., when the ball is thrown a distance of `n` or a multiple of `n` in either direction, it should return to the same player). However, this assessment is not entirely accurate.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The program uses the modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the game. Specifically, `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are used to calculate the new positions.
  - When `r` is a multiple of `n`, `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` will both result in `q % n`, which is `q` itself if `q` is within the range 1 to `n`.

- **Adjusting for 0 Position:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the position might be `0` after the modulo operation by checking if `0` is in the set `ans` and adjusting it to `n`.

### Test Case Analysis:

Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5 2 1
5 0
5 0
```
- **Initial State:**
  - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `x = 1`
  - `ans = {1}`

- **First Throw:**
  - `r = 5`, `c = '0'`
  - `(q + r) % n = (1 + 5) % 5 = 1`
  - `ans` becomes `{1}`

- **Second Throw:**
  - `r = 5`, `c = '0'`
  - `(q + r) % n = (1 + 5) % 5 = 1`
  - `ans` remains `{1}`

- **Final Output:**
  - The program prints:
    ```
    1
    1
    ```
  - This output is correct because the ball returns to player 1 after each throw.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the edge case where the ball is thrown a distance of `n` or a multiple of `n` in either direction. The modulo operation ensures that the ball returns to the same player, and the adjustment for the `0` position is also correctly handled.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
