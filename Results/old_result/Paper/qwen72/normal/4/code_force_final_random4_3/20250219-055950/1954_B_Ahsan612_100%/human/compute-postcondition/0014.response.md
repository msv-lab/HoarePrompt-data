Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous `num` (which was `ar[0]`), `minn` is 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` from its initial state, as it was already set to 1. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
