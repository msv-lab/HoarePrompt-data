Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, `dp[5]` is `(dp[4] + 8 * dp[3]) % 1000000007`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 5.
- The value of `m` remains greater than or equal to 5.
- The value of `dp[3]` is still `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007`.
- The value of `dp[4]` is still `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`.
- The value of `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + 8 * dp[3]) % 1000000007`, where 8 is derived from `(i - 1) * 2` with `i` being 5.
