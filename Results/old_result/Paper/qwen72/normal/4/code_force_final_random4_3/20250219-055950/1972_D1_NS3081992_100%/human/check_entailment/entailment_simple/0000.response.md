### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`, which reads an integer from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case.
   - The loop in `func_15()` iterates over `i` from 1 to the minimum of `m` and the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this value to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \text{ is an integer}
     \]
   - This implies that `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function `func_15()` uses a loop to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by iterating over `i` and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b = i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_15()` handles the edge case where `i * i > n + i` or `i > m` by breaking the loop.
   - The function `func_16()` ensures that the program processes all test cases correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case, followed by a newline.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The logic in `func_15()` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.
- The loop in `func_15()` ensures that the calculation is performed for all valid `i` values.
- The final result is correctly printed for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic of `func_15()`. The condition `i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem's requirement that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The correct condition should be based on the mathematical properties of the problem, which is not clearly reflected in the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program as written does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The loop condition and the calculation inside the loop need to be reviewed and corrected to match the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: **False****
