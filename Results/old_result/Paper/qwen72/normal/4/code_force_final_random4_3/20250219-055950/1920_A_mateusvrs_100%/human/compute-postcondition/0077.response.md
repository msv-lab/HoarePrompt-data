The code `cx.add(x)` suggests that `cx` is a collection (such as a list, set, or another data structure) and the method `add` is used to add the value of `x` to this collection. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, and `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input, the only change is that `x` is added to `cx`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` has been added to `cx`.**
