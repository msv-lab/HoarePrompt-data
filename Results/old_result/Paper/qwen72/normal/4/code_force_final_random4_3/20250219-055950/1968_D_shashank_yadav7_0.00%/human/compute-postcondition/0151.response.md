Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is `k - n` (or `k` is `-1` if `k - n` is less than or equal to 0).
   - `b` is `p[p[...[p[b - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
   - `s` is `p[p[...[p[s - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
   - `bm` is the cumulative result of `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations.
   - `sm` is the cumulative result of `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.
   - `sp` is `sp + sum(a[p[s] - 1] for _ in range(n))`.
   - `bp` is `bp + sum(a[p[b] - 1] for _ in range(n))`.
   - `bm` is equal to `sm`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Draw')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Draw'`.
   - The initial state describes a complex set of operations and conditions, but none of these affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
