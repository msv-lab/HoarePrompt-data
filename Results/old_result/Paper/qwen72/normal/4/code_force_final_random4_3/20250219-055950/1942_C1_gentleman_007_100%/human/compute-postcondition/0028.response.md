To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `node` and `graph[ver]`.

1. **`graph[ver]`**: This is the list that `node` is being iterated over. At the end of the previous iteration, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`.

2. **`node`**: This variable is updated to the next element in `graph[ver]` at the start of each iteration.

Given that `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `node` must be set to the next element in `graph[ver]`. Additionally, `graph[ver]` must still contain at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `graph[ver]` must contain at least two elements (since the first element has already been processed).
- `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least two elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`**
