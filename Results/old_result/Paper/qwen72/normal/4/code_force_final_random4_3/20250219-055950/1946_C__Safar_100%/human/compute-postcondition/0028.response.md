Postcondition: ***`A` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1 or 2, `r` is 0 or 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, then `r` is 1. If `d[x]` is less than `A`, then `d[x]` is 2 and `r` is 0. If `x` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
