Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value at index `i` of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is either 3 or 4 and `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`, `num` will be one of the integers in `ar` at index 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
