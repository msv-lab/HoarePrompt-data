Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0 or 1, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the new input string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `v1` depends on the previous value of `r` and the current value of `v2`, but the current code snippet does not change `v1` directly. Therefore, the condition for `v1` remains the same as in the initial state.
