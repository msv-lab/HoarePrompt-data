You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by user input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is the integer result of `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is the sum of `a` and `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Reading Player Scores:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are sorted such that \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates `x` as half of the total points: \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \).
   - It also calculates `y` as the sum of the two lowest scores: \( y = a + b \).

5. **Determining the Result:**
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the result.
   - The idea behind this is that `x` represents the maximum number of games that could have been played (since each game contributes 2 points), and `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players (since each draw contributes 1 point to each player).

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Total Points Validity:**
  - The check `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the scores to be valid.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
  - The calculation `x = (a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of games played, which must be an integer and even.
  - The calculation `y = a + b` is correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players.

- **Result Determination:**
  - The result `min(x, y)` is correct because:
    - `x` is the maximum number of games that could have been played.
    - `y` is the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players.
    - The minimum of these two values ensures that the number of draws does not exceed the number of games played.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No games were played, so no draws.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: One game occurred, and it ended in a draw.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (3) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 3 3`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (9) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `3 4 5`
  - Output: `6`
  - Reason: Six games occurred, with three draws and three wins/losses.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws, and the remaining points are distributed as wins/losses.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles the problem by ensuring the total points are even and calculating the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. It also handles invalid cases by printing `-1`.
