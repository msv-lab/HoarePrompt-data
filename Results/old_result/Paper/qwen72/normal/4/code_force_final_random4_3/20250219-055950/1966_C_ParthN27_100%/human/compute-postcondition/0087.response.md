Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`.** 

The set `s` initially contained the first element of `arr`. After executing the code, the set `s` now contains both the first and the second elements of `arr`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
