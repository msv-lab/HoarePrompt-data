Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The list `cards` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element in `cards` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). `t` is an input integer.**
