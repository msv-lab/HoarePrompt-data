Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 500 and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `mat` is still a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The variable `res` is still the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
- The loop variable `i` has been decremented to 0, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations from `n` down to 1.
