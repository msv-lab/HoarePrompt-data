Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 × 10^6`. It calculates a value `ans` by starting with `n` and then adding to it the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. The function prints the final value of `ans` and does not return any value. **
