Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`), and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne` plus 1, `zr` is 0, `ans[n-1]` is `n + 1 - fi`, `zeroInd` is 0, and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`. The last element of `preOne` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- `totalOne` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `totalOne - 1`.
- `ol` is equal to the original value of `totalOne`, which is now `totalOne + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
