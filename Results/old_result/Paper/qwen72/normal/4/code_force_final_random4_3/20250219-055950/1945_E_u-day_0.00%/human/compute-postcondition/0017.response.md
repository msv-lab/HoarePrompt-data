Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`, `st` is an empty set, `mid` is `(n-1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `low` is 0 and `high` is `n-1`, so `mid` becomes `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n-1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
