Output State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing a single element which is a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This updates the value of `nums` to be a list of strings representing the integers from the input. The other variables (`total`, `func_1`, `numbers`, `num1`, `num2`) remain unchanged. If the length of `nums` is not 2, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
