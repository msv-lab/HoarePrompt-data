Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`, `r` is `n - 2`, and if `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, and if `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
