Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<'. If `func_1` never returned '<', `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` and `ans1` is equal to '=', `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`, and `ans2` is greater than the current value of `pair_idx`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`.
- Initially, `i` is 0, so `pair_idx` is also set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `max_item_idx`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `ans1` is equal to '=' and `ans2` is greater than the current value of `pair_idx` still holds true.
- The initial state information that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `max_item_idx` is the index of the last `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' (or remains 0 if `func_1` never returned '<') is still valid.
