Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function relies on external functions `func_10` and `func_15` which are expected to return non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `func_10()` must return a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder, `func_15()` has been printed to the console as a positive integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than the current value of `_`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value of `func_15()` is printed followed by a newline.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than `_ + 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value of `func_15()` is printed followed by a newline.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
