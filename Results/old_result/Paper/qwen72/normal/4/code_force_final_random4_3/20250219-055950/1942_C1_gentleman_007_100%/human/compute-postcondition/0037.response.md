The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `q`. If `len(q)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` has been processed completely, and any unvisited nodes have been appended to `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one element.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. `q` must contain at least one element.**
