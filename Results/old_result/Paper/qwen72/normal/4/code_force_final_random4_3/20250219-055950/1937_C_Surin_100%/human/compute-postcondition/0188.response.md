The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `r` is not `>` and not `=`, and the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.**
