To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is greater than 0, because `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `removals` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(`elements`) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000.
- It is not the case that (`removals` == 6 and `negatives` == 3).
- `pos` is a list containing one element which is the value of `s - 2 * n`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `removals` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
