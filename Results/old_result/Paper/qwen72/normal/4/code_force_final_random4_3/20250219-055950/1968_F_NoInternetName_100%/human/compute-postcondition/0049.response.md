Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is equal to `q`, and the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `l` and `r` were the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` was the smallest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, and `upper` was the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists. The program printed 'Yes' if `upper` > `lower` and 'No' otherwise.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `q` iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `q`, indicating that the loop has completed. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `inds` remain unchanged from their initial state. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `l` and `r` were determined by `func_1(int)`, and the variables `lower` and `upper` were computed based on the conditions specified in the loop. The program printed 'Yes' if `upper` was greater than `lower`, and 'No' otherwise, for each iteration.
