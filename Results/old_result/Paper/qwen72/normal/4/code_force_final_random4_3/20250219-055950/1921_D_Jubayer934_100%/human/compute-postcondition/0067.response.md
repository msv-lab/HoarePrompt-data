Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or -1 if the condition never becomes true, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, ..., up to the point where the loop completes all `n` iterations if `temp` is not -1. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains the list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `n` is the number of elements in list `a` and is an input integer, `m` is the number of elements in list `b` and is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.**
