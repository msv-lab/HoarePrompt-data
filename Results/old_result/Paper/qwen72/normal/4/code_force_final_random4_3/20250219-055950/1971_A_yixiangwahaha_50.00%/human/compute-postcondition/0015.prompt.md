Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are integers provided as input, with 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9. `t` is now an input string. `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    xylist = input().split(' ')
    x.append(int(xylist[0]))
    y.append(int(xylist[1]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of the new `xylist` twice, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of the new `xylist` three times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of the new `xylist` three times, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of the new `xylist` four times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
