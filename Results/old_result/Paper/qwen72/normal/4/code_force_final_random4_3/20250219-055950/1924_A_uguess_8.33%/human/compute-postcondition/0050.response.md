Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the current value of `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `ans` is now extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.***
