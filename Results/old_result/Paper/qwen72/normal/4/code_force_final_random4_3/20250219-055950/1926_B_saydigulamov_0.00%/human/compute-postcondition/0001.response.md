The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts mentions that `a` is an input integer, but it does not specify whether `a` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
