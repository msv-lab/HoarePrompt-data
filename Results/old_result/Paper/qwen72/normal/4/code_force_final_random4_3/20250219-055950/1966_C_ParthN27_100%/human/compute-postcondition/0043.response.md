Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the user input integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an empty set, `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2 and the difference between all pairs of consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` is at most 1, `ans` is 0.**
