The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to work with a test case `t` and a list of lists `p` where each sublist `p_i` contains four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200).

The function will return a result for each test case based on the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours provided in `p_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a list of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It returns a result for each test case.**
