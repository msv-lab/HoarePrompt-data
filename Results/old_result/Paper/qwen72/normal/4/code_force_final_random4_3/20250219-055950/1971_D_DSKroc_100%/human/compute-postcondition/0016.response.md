Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length at least 2, `i` is 1, `flag` is 1, and the first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`. If the integer value of the first character of `s` is less than the integer value of the second character of `s`, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
