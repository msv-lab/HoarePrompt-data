Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. No variables are affected by this command, so all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
