Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is the integer value of `l[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `l[p - 1]`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `j = 1` explicitly sets the value of `j` to 1. Since `q` is not equal to 1 (otherwise we would have broken out of the loop or if statement), `j` is set to 1 regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
