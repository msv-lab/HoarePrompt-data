The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` (4 <= n <= 10^9) and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each key in `d` is a prime factor, and each value is the highest power of that prime factor that divides `n`. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, it is included in the dictionary with a value of 1. If `n` is 1, the dictionary `d` remains empty.
