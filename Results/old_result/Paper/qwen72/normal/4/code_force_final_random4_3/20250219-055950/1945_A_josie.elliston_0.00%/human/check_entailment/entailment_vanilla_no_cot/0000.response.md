Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants based on their preferences. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It first checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3 to form a complete tent. If this condition is not met, it returns `None` indicating that it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals.
   - If the condition is met, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using the `ceil` function to ensure that any remaining participants are accounted for in a tent.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly:
- For the first test case (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals), it correctly calculates 3 tents.
- For the second test case (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal), it correctly returns -1 because it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
- For the third test case (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 2 universals), it correctly calculates 3 tents.
- For the fourth test case (1 introvert, 1 extrovert, 1 universal), it correctly returns -1 because it is impossible to accommodate the extrovert.
- For the fifth test case (1 introvert, 3 extroverts, 2 universals), it correctly calculates 3 tents.
- For the sixth test case (19 introverts, 7 extroverts, 18 universals), it correctly calculates 28 tents.
- For the seventh test case (0 introverts, 0 extroverts, 0 universals), it correctly returns 0 tents.
- For the eighth test case (7 introverts, 0 extroverts, 0 universals), it correctly returns 7 tents.
- For the ninth test case (0 introverts, 24 extroverts, 0 universals), it correctly returns 8 tents.
- For the tenth test case (1,000,000,000 introverts, 1,000,000,000 extroverts, 1,000,000,000 universals), it correctly calculates 1,666,666,667 tents.

Thus, the program is correct and handles all the given scenarios appropriately.
