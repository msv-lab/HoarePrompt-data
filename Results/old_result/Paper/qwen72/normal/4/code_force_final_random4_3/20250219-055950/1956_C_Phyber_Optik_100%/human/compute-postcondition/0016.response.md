Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `sum` is calculated as follows: \(1 + (2 \times 2 - 1 \times 1) \times 2 + (3 \times 3 - 2 \times 2) \times 3 + \ldots + (n \times n - (n - 1) \times (n - 1)) \times n\).
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will always print as `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given `j` is 2, the expression `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` will print as `n - 1`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
- The first argument is `1`.
- The second argument is `n - 1`.
- The third argument is the unpacked range from 1 to `n`.

Combining all these, the output will be:
```
1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n
```

### Example:
If `n` is 3, the range `range(1, 4)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`. The print statement will then output:
```
1, 2, 1, 2, 3
```

### General Case:
For any `n` greater than or equal to 2, the output will be:
```
1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n
```

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the range is from 1 to n inclusive)**
