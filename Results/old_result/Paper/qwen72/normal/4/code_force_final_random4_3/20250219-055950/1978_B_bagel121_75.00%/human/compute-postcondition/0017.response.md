Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
3. `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
4. If `a` is less than `b`, then:
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is the integer result of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - If `a < b`, then `k` is calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - If `a >= b`, then `k` is not defined, and the code will raise an error or produce undefined behavior. For the sake of this task, we assume `a < b`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the integer result of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
   - This formula can be simplified as:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left( \frac{b + (b - k + 1)}{2} \right) * k
     \]
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left( \frac{2b - k + 1}{2} \right) * k
     \]
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left( b - \frac{k - 1}{2} \right) * k
     \]
   - Since `k` is an integer, \(\frac{k - 1}{2}\) will be an integer or a float, and the result will be cast to an integer.

3. **Calculate `p2`**:
   - `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).

4. **Sum `ans` and `p2`**:
   - The final value printed will be the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans + p2)` statement will print the sum of `ans` and `p2`, where:
- `ans` is the integer result of \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
- `p2` is \((n - k) * a\).
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans + p2`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2` as described.

Output: **(ans + p2) (where ans is the integer result of (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k and p2 is (n - k) * a, and k is the minimum of b - a + 1 and n)**
