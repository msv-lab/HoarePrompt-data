Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the frequencies `a` and `b` are such that the fireworks from both installations can overlap for more than 2 fireworks at the same time. For example, consider the input `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 7 (as shown in the example output for the second test case). However, the provided program will output `2` because it incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is always 2 if `m` is less than `a` or `b`. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements, making the program incorrect.
