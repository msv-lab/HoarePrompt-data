Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`, `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.** 

The value of `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2` (integer division of `b * n` by 2) plus `a * n % 2` (the remainder of `a * n` divided by 2). The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
