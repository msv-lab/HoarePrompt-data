You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `t` is the total number of test cases, and `_` is `t - 1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If this condition is never met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and then prints `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`) remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. For each test case, it returns "All players have the same score" if all scores are equal, "Two players have the same score, and one player has a different score" if two scores are equal and one is different, or "All players have different scores" if all scores are different.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
