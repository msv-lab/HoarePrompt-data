To determine the output state, let's break down the code and understand its impact on the variables:

1. **`zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**:
   - `func_1` is a function that we assume returns a value based on the list `suffZero` and the index provided.
   - `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, i + 1]`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>'.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.

Let's calculate the value of `zeroInd`:

- `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, where `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1]`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` will be `func_1([0, n - 1], totalOne + 1)`.
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)` will be `func_1([0, n - 1], 1)`.

Assuming `func_1` returns the value at the specified index in `suffZero`:
- `func_1([0, n - 1], totalOne + 1)` will return `n - 1` if `totalOne + 1` is within the bounds of `suffZero` (i.e., 1).
- `func_1([0, n - 1], 1)` will return `n - 1`.

Therefore:
- `zeroInd = 2 * (n - 1) - (n - 1) = n - 1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of `[0, n - 1]`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to 1, `zeroInd` is `n - 1`.**
