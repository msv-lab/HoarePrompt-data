To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is -1.
- `a_i` is -1.
- `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or -1 if the condition never becomes true.
- `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, ..., up to the point where the loop completes all `n` iterations if `temp` is not -1. If `temp` is -1, `ans` remains the list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations.
- `n` is the number of elements in list `a`.
- `m` is the number of elements in list `b`.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Lists `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
   - `b` is a sorted list of the first `m` integers from the input in descending order.

2. **Condition for `temp`**:
   - The condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is checked for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If this condition becomes true for some `i`, `temp` is set to that `i`.
   - If the condition never becomes true, `temp` remains -1.

3. **List `ans`**:
   - If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is populated with the values `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, ..., up to the point where the loop completes all `n` iterations.
   - If `temp` is -1, `ans` is populated with the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations.

4. **Sum of `ans`**:
   - The `sum(ans)` function will calculate the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `temp` is -1, `ans` will contain the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to `abs(a[n-1] - b[n-1])`.
- **Scenario 2**: If `temp` is some index `i` where the condition first becomes true, `ans` will contain the values `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, ..., up to `abs(a[n-1] - b[-(n - (n-1))])`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences calculated according to the rules described.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of absolute differences calculated based on the condition and the lists a and b)**
