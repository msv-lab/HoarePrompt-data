Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `v1` is 0.**

The code snippet `v1 = 0` sets the variable `v1` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `v1` while maintaining all other initial conditions.
