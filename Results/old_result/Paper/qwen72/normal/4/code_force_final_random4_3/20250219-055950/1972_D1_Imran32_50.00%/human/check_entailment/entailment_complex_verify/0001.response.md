### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in the range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem.
   - The variable `k` is read but not used, which suggests a potential misunderstanding or error in the function.
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to be related to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // cnt\) does not correspond to any known method for solving the given problem.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
   - The variable `root` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of \(n\) plus 1.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive), and for each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The logic inside the function `func_1()` is incorrect and does not match the problem requirements.
   - The program does not consider the variable \(m\) in its calculations, which is a critical part of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided solution is flawed and does not address the problem requirements. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
