Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the current values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.***
