To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `l < r`**
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `r = n - 1` and `l = 0`, `n - 1` must be greater than 0).

2. **Condition 2: `a[l] == a[l + 1]`**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is 0, so we need to check `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this does not affect the loop).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is 1.
- `end` is 1.
- `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`. Additionally, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.**
