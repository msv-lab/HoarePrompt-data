Output State: **`t`, `a_i`, `b`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and then takes the first `n` elements of this sorted list to assign to `a`.
- The variables `t`, `a_i`, `b`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
- `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, as specified in the initial state.
- `a` is now a list containing the first `n` elements of the sorted input integers.
