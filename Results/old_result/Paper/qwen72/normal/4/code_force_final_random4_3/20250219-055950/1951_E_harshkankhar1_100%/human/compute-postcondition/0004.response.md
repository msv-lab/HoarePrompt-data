The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the string `s`, its length `n`, the variable `x`, and the result of the function `func_1` applied to `s`. However, none of these variables or the result of `func_1` are used in the `print` statement.

Output: **1**
