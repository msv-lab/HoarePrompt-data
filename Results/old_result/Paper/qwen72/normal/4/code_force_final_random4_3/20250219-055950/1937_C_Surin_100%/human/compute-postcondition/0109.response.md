Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1` (but `kp` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can ignore it for the print statement).
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.
   - Additionally, `r` is `=` and not `>`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The print statement uses `i` and `prev` directly.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'? 1 1 0 0'` because:
     - `i` is 1.
     - `prev` is 0.
     - The format string `f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}'` will substitute the values of `i` and `prev` into the string.

Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
