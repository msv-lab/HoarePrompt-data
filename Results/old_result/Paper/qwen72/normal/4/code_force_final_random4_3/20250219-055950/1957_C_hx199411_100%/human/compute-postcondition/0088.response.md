Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the list `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m - 1` and the list `dp` is populated according to the given formula for each `j` from 3 to `m`. `num` is 0.**
