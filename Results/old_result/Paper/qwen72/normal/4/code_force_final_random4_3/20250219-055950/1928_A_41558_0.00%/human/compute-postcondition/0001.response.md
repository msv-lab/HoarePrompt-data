To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is initialized by the `range(n)` function. The other variables mentioned in the state (t, a, b) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
