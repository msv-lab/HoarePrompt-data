Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, 3, 3)`, `max_item_idx` is 3.**

The value of `max_item_idx` is updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
