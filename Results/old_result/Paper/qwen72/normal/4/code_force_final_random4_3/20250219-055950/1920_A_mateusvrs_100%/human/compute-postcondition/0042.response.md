The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `tmp` was either 0 or 1 based on the initial conditions. If `i` was greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` was 1, and now it becomes 2. Otherwise, `tmp` was 0, and now it becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is either 1 or 2.**
