Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans1 = sum(a)` assigns the sum of all elements in the list `a` to the variable `ans1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- The value of `ans` is still the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`, but `ans1` has been updated to the sum of all elements in `a`.
- The conditions and values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state.
