Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `minn` is `inf`.**

The code initializes the variable `minn` to `inf` (infinity). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state information with the addition that `minn` is now set to infinity.
