The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the input integer `n` for the number of iterations. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `n`, we need to adjust `_` to be 2 for the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the input that determines the total number of iterations.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` remains the same. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
