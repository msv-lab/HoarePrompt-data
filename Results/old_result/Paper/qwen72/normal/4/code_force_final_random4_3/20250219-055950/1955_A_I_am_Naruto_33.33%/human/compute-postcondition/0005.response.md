Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder, which is not used in the code.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user inputs a positive integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000. This is not used in the code.
- `n` is greater than 1. This means `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(ans1, ans2))
```

### Variables and Their Values:
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`ans1` Calculation:**
   - `ans1` is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `ans1 = a * n`

2. **`ans2` Calculation:**
   - `ans2` is a bit more complex. It involves two parts:
     - `b * n // 2`: This is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
     - `a * n % 2`: This is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`

3. **Determine the Minimum:**
   - The `min` function will compare `ans1` and `ans2` and return the smaller of the two.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The `print` statement will output the smaller value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `ans1` is `a * n`.
- `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2) (where `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1)**
