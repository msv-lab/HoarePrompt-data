Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, and `flag` is 1 if the first character of `s` is less than the second character, otherwise `flag` is 0. If the third character of `s` is less than the fourth character, `flag` is 1. The value of `count` is 3 if the second and third characters of `s` are different and the third and fourth characters are also different, otherwise `count` is 2 if the second and third characters are different, and `count` is 1 if the second and third characters are the same.***
