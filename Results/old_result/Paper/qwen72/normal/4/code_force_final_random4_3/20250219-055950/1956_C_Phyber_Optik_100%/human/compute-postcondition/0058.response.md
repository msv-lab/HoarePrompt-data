Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \).
   - `i` is `n` + 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which is `n - 1`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first element printed is `1`.
   - The second element printed is `n - 1`.
   - The subsequent elements printed are the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Given that `n` must be at least 2, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2:

- If `n = 2`:
  - `n - 1` is `2 - 1` which is `1`.
  - `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 3)`, which is `[1, 2]`.

So, the output for `n = 2` would be:
```
1 1 1 2
```

For a general value of `n`:
- The output will be `1`, followed by `n - 1`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
