### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - This condition is handled correctly in the program.

   - **Case 2: `b > a` and `b - a >= n`**
     - If the modified price `b` is greater than the usual price `a` and the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly calculates this profit using `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `b > a` and `b - a < n`**
     - If the modified price `b` is greater than the usual price `a` but the difference `b - a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula: \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The program correctly calculates this profit using `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the profit for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their maximum values (10^9) and when `t` is at its maximum value (10^4).

5. **Mathematical Formulas:**
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is correctly applied in the program.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the given conditions and constraints. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given test cases.
