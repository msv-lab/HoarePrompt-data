The `s.sort()` method sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list containing all integers from `arr`, so after sorting, `s` will be a sorted version of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr`, `ans` is 1.**
