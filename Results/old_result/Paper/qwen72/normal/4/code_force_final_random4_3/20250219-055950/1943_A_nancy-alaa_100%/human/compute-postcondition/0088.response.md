Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `i` (which is 0) is present in the keys of `mpp` and the count of `i` in `mpp` is 1, `first` is set to True. If `i` is not present in the keys of `mpp` or the count of `i` in `mpp` is not 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
