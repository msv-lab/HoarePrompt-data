Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is a list with `m` elements (1 <= m <= n), `j` is the last element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `visited` list also remains unchanged. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists still have their initial values, with `coef0` having 0 at indices 0 and 1 and `None` elsewhere, and `coef1` having 1 at indices 0 and 1 and `None` elsewhere. The `nodes` list contains `m` elements, where `m` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `j` is the last element in the `nodes` list. The variable `ok` is still `True`. The variable `c0` is the sum of all elements in `coef0` at the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all elements in `coef1` at the indices present in `nodes`.
