Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`. `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.** 

The value of `ans1` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
