Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right, and `ans` is the number of elements in the list `a` that have been reduced to 0, plus 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`; otherwise, `ans` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer.
- The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` is now a list of integers instead of strings.
