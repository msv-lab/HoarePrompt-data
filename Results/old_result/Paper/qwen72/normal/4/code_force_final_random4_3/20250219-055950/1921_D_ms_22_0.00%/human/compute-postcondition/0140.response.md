Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `tp2` is decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
