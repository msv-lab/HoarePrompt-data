Postcondition: ***`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `i` > 0, `back` is now equal to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` < `n - 1`, `forward` is now equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.***
