Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` now contains `x` as an element.***
