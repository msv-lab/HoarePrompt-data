To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n`

The loop will execute if the range `0` to `n - 1` is non-empty. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `ii` is 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `rem` is 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user
- `r` is the first element of the list `a`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `y` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` in the loop head is a loop counter and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` must be greater than 1

The other variables and objects in the initial state do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `y` is 0**
