The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with the constraint that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.

The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
