To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head: `i`, `m`, and the range of the loop. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3 (since the loop starts from 3 and goes up to `m + 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n (not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `k - 1` (relevant, but needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to start)
- `m` is `n - num` (relevant, must be at least 3 for the loop to execute)
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3 (not directly relevant to the loop head)
- `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop (indirectly relevant through `m`)

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must be 3 (since the loop starts from 3).
- `m` must be at least 3 (since the loop iterates from 3 to `m + 1`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
