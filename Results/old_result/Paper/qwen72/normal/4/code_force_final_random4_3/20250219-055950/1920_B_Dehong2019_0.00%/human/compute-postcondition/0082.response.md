Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.
- The updated `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`.
- `ans` is still the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.
