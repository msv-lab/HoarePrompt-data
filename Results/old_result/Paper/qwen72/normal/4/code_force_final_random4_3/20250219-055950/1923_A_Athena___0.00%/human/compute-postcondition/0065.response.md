Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a non-empty list of integers with leading and trailing zeros removed, but this is no longer relevant as `a` is now assigned a new list based on user input.
- The length of the new list `a` is `len(a)`, and `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1`.
- The number of zeros in the list `a` is still calculated and stored in `res`, but the specific value of `res` depends on the new list `a`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
