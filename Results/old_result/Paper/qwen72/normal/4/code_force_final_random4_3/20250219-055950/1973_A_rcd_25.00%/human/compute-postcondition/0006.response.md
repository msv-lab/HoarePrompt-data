Postcondition: ***`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
