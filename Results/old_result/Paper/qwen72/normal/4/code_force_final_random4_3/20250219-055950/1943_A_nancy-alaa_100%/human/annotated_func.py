#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `a` and the number of elements `n`. The array `a` should be a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and `n` is a positive integer. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The variable `i` is the smallest integer not in `mpp` keys or the smallest integer in `mpp` keys with a count of 1 where `first` is True. The variable `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer not present in `arr` or the smallest integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is greater than any previously seen integer that also appears exactly once. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program has processed `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
