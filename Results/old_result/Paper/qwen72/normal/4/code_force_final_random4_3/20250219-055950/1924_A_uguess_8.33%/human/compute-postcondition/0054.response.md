Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in the new `s`, and `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.**
