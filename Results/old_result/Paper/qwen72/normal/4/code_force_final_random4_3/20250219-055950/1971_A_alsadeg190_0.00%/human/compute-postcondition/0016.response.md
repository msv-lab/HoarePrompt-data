Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values from the input.
   - `i` is 2 (though `i` is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
   - If the new `x` > the new `y`, then `x` is greater than `y`.
   - Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(y, x)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the input.
   - The condition `x > y` or `x <= y` is evaluated, but it does not change the values of `x` and `y`.
   - The only constraint on `x` is that it must be greater than 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in the order they are provided.
   - Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are the integer values provided by the input, and x is greater than 1)**
