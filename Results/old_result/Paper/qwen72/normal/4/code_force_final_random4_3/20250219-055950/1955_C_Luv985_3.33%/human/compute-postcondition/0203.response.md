Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the initial conditions and the number of iterations, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right, and `ans` is the total number of elements that have been reduced to 0. Additionally, the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`.**
