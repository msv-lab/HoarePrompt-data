Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `M` to a new list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- The values of `L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this code snippet.
- The initial state information about `M` being a sorted list of integers from the user's input is now updated to reflect the new input.
- The precondition that `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1) and the other conditions involving `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain valid.
