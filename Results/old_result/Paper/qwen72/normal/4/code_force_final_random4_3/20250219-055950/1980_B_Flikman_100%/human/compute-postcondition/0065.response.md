The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `removed_count` remains unchanged or increased by 1 depending on the condition in the loop body**
