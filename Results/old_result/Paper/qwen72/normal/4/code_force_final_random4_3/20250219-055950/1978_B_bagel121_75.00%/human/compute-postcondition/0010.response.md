Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.***
