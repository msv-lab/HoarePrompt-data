### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `L` and `R`, which contain the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Basic Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last element of `L` (the indices of prefix maximums) is equal to the first element of `R` (the indices of suffix maximums). This is necessary because the last prefix maximum must also be the first suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is because the first prefix maximum must be at index 1, and the first suffix maximum must be at index `N`.

3. **Overlap Check:**
   - If both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1, it checks if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If they are equal, it returns 0 because this would imply an invalid permutation.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to arrange the elements using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is because the element at index `L[-1]` (which is also `R[0]`) must be the maximum element, and the remaining elements can be arranged in the remaining positions.

5. **Left Side Calculation:**
   - If `M1` is greater than 1, it iterates from the second-to-last element of `L` to the first element. For each index that is not a prefix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the left side of the permutation.

6. **Right Side Calculation:**
   - If `M2` is greater than 1, it iterates from the second element of `R` to the last element. For each index that is not a suffix maximum, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the right side of the permutation.

7. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that the final answer is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initial Checks:**
  - The checks for the last element of `L` being equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` being 1, and the first element of `R` being `N` are correct and necessary.
  - The check for the second-to-last element of `L` being equal to the second element of `R` is also correct and necessary to avoid invalid permutations.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is correct because it correctly counts the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the positions before the last prefix maximum.

- **Left and Right Side Calculations:**
  - The logic for iterating through the indices and multiplying the answer by the number of remaining elements is correct. It ensures that the elements are placed in valid positions according to the prefix and suffix maximums.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the answer fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It performs the necessary checks and calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
