Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is greater than the new value of `i`, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, and if `x[l - 1]` equals `x[r]`, the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `i`, `l`, and `r`.***
