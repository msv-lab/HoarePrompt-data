### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindromic String:**
   - The program first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "1", and the string `s` itself. This is correct because if the string is already non-palindromic, it can be considered as a valid partition with one part.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the program then searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`. This is done using a loop and the variable `x` is set to the index of the first non-matching character.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), `x` remains -1, and the program prints "NO". This is correct because a string composed of the same character repeated multiple times cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If a non-matching character is found at index `x`, the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because it ensures that both parts are non-palindromic.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of `s`):
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `s = "aa"`, `x` will be 1, and the program will print "NO", which is incorrect. The string "aa" can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings "a" and "a".
     - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is correct because it ensures that both parts are non-palindromic.

4. **Handling Single-Character Strings:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where the string has a length of 1. However, since the initial check for the entire string being a palindrome will always return `True` for a single-character string, the program will print "NO" in this case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program fails to handle cases where the string is composed of the same character repeated multiple times but has a length greater than 1. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for strings like "aa", which can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
