To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the `ans` set.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop.
- If `0` is in `ans`, the value `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
- `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The set `ans` is initially populated with values derived from some operations involving `q`, `r`, and `n`.
   - The exact initial values of `ans` are not explicitly provided, but we know that it contains values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, with the loop variable `_` ranging from `0` to `m - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the set `ans` is updated based on the value of `c`:
     - If `c` is true, new values `(q + r) % n` are added to `ans`.
     - If `c` is false, new values `(q - r) % n` are added to `ans`.

3. **Removal and Addition**:
   - After the loop completes, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.

4. **Final State of `ans`**:
   - The final state of `ans` will be a set containing unique values derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, possibly with `0` removed and `n` added.

5. **Length of `ans`**:
   - The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after all the transformations.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact initial values of `ans` and the value of `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical length of `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the given transformations.

Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` was present, after `m` iterations of the loop)**
