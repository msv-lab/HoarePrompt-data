Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `ans` by iterating through the grid and deciding whether to take the value from the top row (`a`) or the bottom row (`b`). However, the decision-making process is not optimal for finding the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]: work = False` is intended to switch to the bottom row if the next value in the top row is greater than the current value in the bottom row. This is not sufficient to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The program should consider both rows at each step and choose the smallest possible value, while also ensuring that the path is valid (i.e., it can reach the bottom-right cell).

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string, but the logic is incorrect.
   - The counter is incremented based on the condition `if a[j + 1] == b[j]: counter += 1`, which does not correctly account for all possible paths.
   - The program should count the number of valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string, which involves more complex logic to ensure that all possible paths are considered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    ans = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            ans.append(a[i])
            i += 1
        elif b[i] < a[i]:
            ans.append(b[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            # Both a[i] and b[i] are the same, choose the one that allows a valid path
            if i == 0 or (i > 0 and a[i-1] == a[i]):
                ans.append(a[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                ans.append(b[i])
                i += 1
    return ''.join(ans)

def count_paths(a, b, smallest_string):
    n = len(a)
    count = 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == smallest_string[i] and a[i + 1] == smallest_string[i + 1]:
            count += 1
        elif a[i] == smallest_string[i] and b[i] == smallest_string[i + 1]:
            count += 1
        elif b[i] == smallest_string[i] and a[i] == smallest_string[i + 1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        smallest_string = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(a, b)
        print(smallest_string)
        path_count = count_paths(a, b, smallest_string)
        print(path_count)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **find_lexicographically_smallest_string**:
   - This function constructs the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the values in the top and bottom rows at each position.
   - If both values are the same, it chooses the one that allows a valid path.

2. **count_paths**:
   - This function counts the number of valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It iterates through the grid and checks if the current and next positions in the smallest string can be achieved by valid moves (right or down).

This corrected version should correctly solve the problem as described.
