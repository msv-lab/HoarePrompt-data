Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `numbers` is an empty list.**
