Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` <= `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`. Additionally, the current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
