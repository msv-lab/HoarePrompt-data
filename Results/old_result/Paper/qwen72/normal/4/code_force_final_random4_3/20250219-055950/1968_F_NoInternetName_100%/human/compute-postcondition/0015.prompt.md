Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integer 0, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` that must have at least 1 element, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and `i`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `i` is the first element of `a`, `inds[i]` now contains the integer 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 2 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, and `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, `i` is the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` with at least 3 elements, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, the result of `1 ^ a[1]`, and the result of `x[-1] ^ a[2]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the integer 0, `inds[1]` containing the integer 1, `inds[1 ^ a[1]]` containing the integers 1 and 2, and `inds[x[-1]]` containing the integers 1, 2, and 3, `i` is the third element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
