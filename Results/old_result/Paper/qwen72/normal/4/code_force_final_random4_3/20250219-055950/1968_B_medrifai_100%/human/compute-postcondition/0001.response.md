Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 <= i, j <= 2 * 10^5, `index` is the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. The character `a[i]` is found in the substring `b[j:]`, and `index` is not -1.**
