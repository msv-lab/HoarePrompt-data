You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of characters in the string 'ABCDEFG' that are either missing from `s` or appear fewer than `m` times, and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `ans` being undefined or reset for the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Problem Counting**: For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, and then reads the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.
3. **Counter Usage**: It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. **Initial Check**: It checks if any difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is missing in the problem bank. If a difficulty level is missing, it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because `m` rounds need to be held, and each round requires one problem of each difficulty.
5. **Additional Problems**: For each difficulty level that is present but has fewer than `m` problems, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to account for the additional problems needed.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- If `t` is 1 and the string `s` contains all difficulty levels at least once, it will correctly output 0.
- If `t` is 1 and the string `s` is missing some difficulty levels, it will correctly output the number of additional problems needed.
- If `t` is greater than 1, it will correctly process each test case independently and output the correct results for each.

Thus, the program is correct for every potential case.
