Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, minus 1, from the user inputs.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, which means `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- For each iteration, the user inputs two integers `u` and `v`, which are then decremented by 1.
- The loop appends `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`, effectively building a list of connections for each node.
- After all iterations, `u2vs` will contain the indices of the nodes connected to each node, with each index being decremented by 1 from the original user input.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- The values of `u` and `v` are updated in each iteration but are not retained after the loop completes, so they do not affect the final state.
