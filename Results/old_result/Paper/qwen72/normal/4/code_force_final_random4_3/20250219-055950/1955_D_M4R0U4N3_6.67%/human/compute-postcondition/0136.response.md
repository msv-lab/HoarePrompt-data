Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2`. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`, and `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged otherwise. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`. If `old` is not in `extra` and is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` now contains `old` and `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `done`), `extra` no longer contains `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `extra`), `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]` (if `a[r]` was in `todo`), otherwise `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`, and `ans` is `ans + 1` if `len(done) >= k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`.
- The value of `r` is `m + 2`, so `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`.
- If `a[r]` (i.e., `a[m + 2]`) was in `todo`, it is now removed from `todo`.
- The other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless they are affected by the removal of `a[r]` from `todo`.
- The states of `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this code, but may be updated based on the conditions described in the initial state.
