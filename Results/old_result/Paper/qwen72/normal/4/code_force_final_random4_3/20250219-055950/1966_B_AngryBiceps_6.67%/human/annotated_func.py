#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement, which includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and an n × m grid represented by a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are integers input by the user for the last test case, and `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings for the last test case. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` for the last test case, and `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` for the last test case. The loop has processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has checked the conditions and printed 'NO' if either the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row, or if the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row.
2. If the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column.
If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the grid meets the specified conditions.
