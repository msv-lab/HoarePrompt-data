The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `removals + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `removals` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is reduced by the value of the last element in `elements`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if the indices `-(negatives + 1)` and `-1` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`**
