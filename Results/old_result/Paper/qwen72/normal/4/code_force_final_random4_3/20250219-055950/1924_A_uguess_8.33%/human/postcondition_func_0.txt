The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the string `s` can be divided into `n` substrings, each containing all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints 'YES'. If it cannot, the function prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string that represents the closest possible valid substring to meet the condition, padded with additional characters as needed. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes `t` being 0, `i` being the total number of test cases processed, and the last values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` from the final test case.
