The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `q`. The loop can execute one more time if `q` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is greater than 1, and `_` is not explicitly tracked but is incremented implicitly by the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be greater than 0 after the decrement that occurs at the start of each iteration.

State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the appended element is 'YES'. Otherwise, the appended element is 'NO'.**
