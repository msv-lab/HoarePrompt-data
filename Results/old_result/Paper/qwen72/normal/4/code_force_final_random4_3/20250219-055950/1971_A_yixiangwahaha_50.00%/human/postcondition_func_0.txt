The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which is not used within the function. It then reads 10 pairs of integers (each pair on a new line) and stores them in two lists, `x` and `y`. After collecting the inputs, the function iterates through these lists and prints each pair of integers in a sorted order, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` each contain 10 integers, and the function has printed 10 lines of sorted integer pairs.
