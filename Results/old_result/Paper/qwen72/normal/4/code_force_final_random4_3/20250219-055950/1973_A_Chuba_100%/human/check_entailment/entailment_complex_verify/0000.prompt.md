You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is `t-1`, `v` is a list of integers provided by the user. For each iteration, if the sum of the first three elements of `v` (i.e., `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is odd, `-1` is printed. If the sum is even, `result` is set to `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and this value is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`) from the user. If the sum of these three integers is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle all the potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
   \]
   This formula is derived from the constraints and the scoring system:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The maximum number of draws is the total points divided by 2, minus the points that must be won by the highest scorer to maintain the score difference.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All scores are zero**: The program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **One draw**: The program correctly handles cases where only one draw occurred.
   - **No valid set of games**: The program correctly prints `-1` when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
   - **Maximum draws**: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid scores.

After reviewing the program and considering various edge cases and potential inputs, I cannot find any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
