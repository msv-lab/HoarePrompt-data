### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input using `func_1(int)` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q` using `func_1(int)`, and then reads the array `a` using `func_1(int)`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `x` with a single element `0` to store the prefix XOR values.
   - It iterates through the array `a`, computing the prefix XOR for each element and appending it to `x`.
   - This step is crucial for efficiently answering the queries. The prefix XOR allows us to compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time.
   - The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in `x`.

3. **Index Tracking:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` of lists `inds` to track the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each prefix XOR value, it appends the current index to the corresponding list in `inds`.
   - This allows the program to quickly find the required indices for the binary search.
   - The program correctly tracks the indices of each prefix XOR value.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r` using `func_1(int)`.
   - It checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is zero by comparing `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because a subarray with a zero XOR can always be split into parts with zero XOR.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray such that the XOR of the parts is equal.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".
   - The logic for handling queries is correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_3` is a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
   - `func_4` is another wrapper around `func_2` that adds 1 to the result if a valid index is found, or returns `None` if no valid index is found.
   - The binary search functions are implemented correctly and are used appropriately to find the required indices.

### Annotations and Verification:
- **State of the program before `func_1` calls:**
  - The program correctly applies the `cast` function to each element of the input string, which is split by spaces.
  - This is verified by the annotated code and the problem description.

- **State of the program before `func_2` calls:**
  - The program correctly sets up the binary search with `l` and `r` initialized to `0` and `len(arr)`, respectively.
  - The binary search is performed correctly to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
  - The final state of `l` and `r` is correctly described in the annotations.

- **State of the program before `func_3` and `func_4` calls:**
  - `func_3` and `func_4` are correctly implemented as wrappers around `func_2`.
  - They are used appropriately to find the required indices for the query handling.

- **State of the program before and during the query loop:**
  - The program correctly reads the query indices `l` and `r`.
  - It correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero and prints "Yes" if it is.
  - For non-zero XOR, it correctly uses the binary search functions to find the required indices and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the comparison of `upper` and `lower`.
  - The final state of the program after processing all queries is correctly described in the annotations.
