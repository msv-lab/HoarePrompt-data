Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation:
- `s` is now an input string provided by the user.
- `hmp` is updated to be a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `_`, and `ans`) retain their previous values or conditions, with `_` being incremented by 1.
