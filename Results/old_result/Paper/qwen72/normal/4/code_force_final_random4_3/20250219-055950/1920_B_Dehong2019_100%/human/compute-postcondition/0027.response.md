Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[x + 1 + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value. Since `i` is `x + 1`, `i + x` is `x + 1 + x`, which simplifies to `2 * x + 1`.
- Therefore, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[2 * x + 1]`.
- The value of `ans2` is updated to the maximum of the new value of `ans1` and its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
