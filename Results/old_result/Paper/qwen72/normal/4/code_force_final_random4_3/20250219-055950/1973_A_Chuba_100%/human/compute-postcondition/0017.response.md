The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a constant string `'-1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `v`, and `result`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will simply print the string `'-1'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
