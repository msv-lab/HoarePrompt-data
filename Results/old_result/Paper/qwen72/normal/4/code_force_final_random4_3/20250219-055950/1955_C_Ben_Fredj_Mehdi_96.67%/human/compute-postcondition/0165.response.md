Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, the element at index `d` in `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, the element at index `g-1` in `a` is now `int(a[g-1]) - 1` and `g` is now `g + 1`. Otherwise, the element at index `g` in `a` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`.***
