Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`. If `ar[3]` is equal to `num` (the third element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is the fifth element of `ar`. `i` is 5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 5.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
