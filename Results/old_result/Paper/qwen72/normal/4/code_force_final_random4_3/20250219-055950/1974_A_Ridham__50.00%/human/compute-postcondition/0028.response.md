The code snippet `total_space = space_y + space_x` updates the value of `total_space` by summing up the values of `space_y` and `space_x`. Given the initial state, `space_x` is equal to `x`, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`. Therefore, `total_space` will be updated to `x + y * 4`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `n` is still greater than 0, `result` is still a list, `x` and `y` are still integers within the range 0 to 99, `space_x` is still equal to `x`, `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is still determined by whether `y` is even or odd, `remaining_cells` is still calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and the conditions for updating `result` and decrementing `n` by 1 remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`; otherwise, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15, `n` is `n - 1`.**
