### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a list of `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (index `k`) with another cow once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list `l`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It finds the rating of our cow `x` at index `k`.
   - It initializes a list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of such higher-rated cows.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and appends the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x` to `ind` until it finds two such cows.

4. **Cases to Consider:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - Our cow will win all matches until the end, which is `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.

   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If this higher-rated cow is at index `0`, our cow will lose the first match.
     - If this higher-rated cow is after our cow, our cow will win until it meets this cow.
     - If this higher-rated cow is before our cow, our cow will win until it meets this cow, and we can swap our cow to a position before this cow to maximize wins.
     - The function returns the maximum number of wins based on these conditions.

   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at index `0`, our cow will lose the first match.
     - If our cow is after the second higher-rated cow, we can swap our cow to a position before the first higher-rated cow to maximize wins.
     - If our cow is between the two higher-rated cows, we can swap our cow to a position before the first higher-rated cow or between the two higher-rated cows to maximize wins.
     - The function returns the maximum number of wins based on these conditions.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the base cases where no higher-rated cows or only one higher-rated cow exists.
   - It also correctly handles the case where two higher-rated cows exist, ensuring the optimal swap position is chosen to maximize wins.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve by either swapping or not swapping. The reasoning and the conditions in the function are sound and cover all possible scenarios.

**Correctness: True**
