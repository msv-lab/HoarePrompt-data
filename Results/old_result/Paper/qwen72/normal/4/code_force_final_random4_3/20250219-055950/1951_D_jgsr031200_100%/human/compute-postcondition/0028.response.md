Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
3. `curr` is `n // 1`.
4. `h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
5. `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`.
6. `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`i` is 1**: This is straightforward; `i` is set to 1.
2. **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`:** This means `costs` is a list with two elements. The first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is 1.
3. **`curr` is `n // 1`:** This is equivalent to `curr = n` because dividing `n` by 1 does not change its value.
4. **`h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`:** Let's break this down:
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` is the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1`.
   - `n % (n - k + 1)` is the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`.
   - `(n % (n - k + 1) // 1)` is the integer division of the remainder by 1, which is just the remainder itself.
   - Therefore, `h` is updated to `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1))`.
5. **`n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`:** This is a bit tricky:
   - `n % (n - k + 1)` gives the remainder of `n` divided by `n - k + 1`.
   - `(n % (n - k + 1) % 1)` gives the remainder of the above result divided by 1.
   - The remainder of any number divided by 1 is 0.
   - Therefore, `n` is set to 0.
6. **`h` is greater than or equal to `k`:** This is a condition that must be true for the code to execute.

### Final State:
- `n` is 0.
- `h` is updated based on the formula `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1))`.
- Since `n` is 0, `n // (n - k + 1)` is 0 and `n % (n - k + 1)` is 0.
- Therefore, `h` is updated to `h + 0 + 0 = h`.

Given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition `h >= k` is satisfied, and the code will print 'YES'.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
