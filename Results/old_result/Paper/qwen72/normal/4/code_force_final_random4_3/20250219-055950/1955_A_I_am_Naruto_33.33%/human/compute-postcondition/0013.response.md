Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder and not used in the code.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This is the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `a` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `b` is an integer provided by the user input.
   - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(min(ans1, ans2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `ans2` is calculated in two parts:
     - `b * n // 2` is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
     - `a * n % 2` is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.
   - The `min` function returns the smaller of the two values `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(ans1, ans2)`.
   - However, based on the given formulas, the output will be the smaller of the two values calculated from the formulas.

Output: **min(ans1, ans2) (where ans1 is a * n and ans2 is b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
