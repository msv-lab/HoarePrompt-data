Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned as a precondition).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is calculated as the sum of a series: \(1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + \ldots + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n\).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `n - 3 + 1`, which is `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 2`.
   - The subsequent values printed are the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a sequence of numbers starting with `2`, followed by `n - 2`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n, and the range from 1 to n is the sequence of integers from 1 to n)**
