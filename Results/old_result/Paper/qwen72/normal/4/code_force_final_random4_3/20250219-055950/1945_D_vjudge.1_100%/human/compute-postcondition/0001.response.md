Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
