Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it handles the visibility period of the fireworks and the launch frequencies of the two installations.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The program calculates the number of fireworks that can be launched within `m` minutes using `m // a` and `m // b`. However, this does not account for the fact that fireworks are visible for `m + 1` minutes, and the overlap of visibility periods needs to be considered.
   - The program simply adds 2 to the sum of `m // a` and `m // b`, which is incorrect. The number 2 is added to account for the initial launch of each installation, but this does not correctly handle the visibility overlap.

2. **Handling of Visibility Overlap:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility periods. For example, if `a` and `b` are both 1 and `m` is very large, the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks should be `m + 2` (one from each installation plus `m` additional minutes of visibility), but the program does not account for this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. Additionally, you need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes and account for the overlap.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def max_simultaneous_fireworks(a, b, m):
    lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
    max_fireworks = 0
    
    # Check the visibility at the first launch time of each installation
    max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, 2)
    
    # Check the visibility at the LCM of a and b
    if lcm_ab <= m + 1:
        max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, (m + 1) // lcm_ab * 2)
    
    # Check the visibility at the first overlap of a and b
    if a <= m + 1 and b <= m + 1:
        max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm_ab + 1)
    
    return max_fireworks

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_simultaneous_fireworks(a, b, m))
```

### Explanation:
1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` is calculated to find the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   
2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks the visibility at the first launch time of each installation, which is always 2 (one from each installation).

3. **Visibility at LCM:**
   - The program checks the visibility at the LCM of `a` and `b` to see how many pairs of simultaneous launches can occur within the visibility period `m + 1`.

4. **Visibility at Overlap:**
   - The program checks the visibility at the first overlap of `a` and `b` and adjusts for the overlap to ensure the correct count of simultaneous fireworks.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
