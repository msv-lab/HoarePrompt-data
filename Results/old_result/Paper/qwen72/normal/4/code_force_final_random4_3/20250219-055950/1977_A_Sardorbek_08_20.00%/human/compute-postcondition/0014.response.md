Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`), `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`. If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.***
