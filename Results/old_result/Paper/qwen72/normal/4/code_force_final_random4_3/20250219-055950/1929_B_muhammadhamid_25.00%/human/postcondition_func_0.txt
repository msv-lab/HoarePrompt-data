The function processes multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` provided by the user, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. For each pair, the function prints a number based on the following rules: if `k` is 1, it prints 1; if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`; if `k` is greater than `2 * n`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all pairs, the function concludes.
