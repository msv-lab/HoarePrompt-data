### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input, which are the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the total points are distributed among the players, and the maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the excess points that one player might have over the others.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd, which is impossible.
   - It also handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the result is `0` (no draws).
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the result is `1` (one draw).
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), and the result is `-1` (impossible).
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the result is `2` (two draws).
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), and the result is `-1` (impossible).
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the result is `6` (six draws).
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the result is `2` (two draws).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify if the scores are inconsistent. The formula used is valid and the edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
