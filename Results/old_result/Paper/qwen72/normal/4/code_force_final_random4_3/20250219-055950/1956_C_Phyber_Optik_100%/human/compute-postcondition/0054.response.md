The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because the range will be from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive), which means it will run from 1 to `n`.

Before the loop starts, `j` is `n`, which is not the correct initial state for the loop to execute. The loop expects `j` to start from 1. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.

The state of `t` and `sum` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
