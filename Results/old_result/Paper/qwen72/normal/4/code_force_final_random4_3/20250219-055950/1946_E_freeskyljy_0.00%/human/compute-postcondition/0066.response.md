The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided context, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each defined by a tuple `(n, m_1, m_2)` and two lists of integers representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The function evaluates these test cases and returns a value based on the conditions specified:

- Case_1: If the conditions are not met, the function returns 0.
- Case_2: If the conditions are not met, the function returns 0.
- Case_3: If the conditions are not met, the function returns 0.
- Case_4: If `M1` (number of prefix maximums) is greater than 1 and `M2` (number of suffix maximums) is greater than 1, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is calculated as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and the final value of `ans` is returned.

Functionality: **The function evaluates a series of test cases, each defined by a tuple (n, m_1, m_2) and two lists of integers representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. It returns 0 in several cases where the conditions are not met. If the number of prefix maximums (m_1) is greater than 1 and the number of suffix maximums (m_2) is greater than 1, it returns a value `ans` calculated as the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. If the number of suffix maximums (m_2) is not greater than 1, it updates `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and returns the final value of `ans`.**
