Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is incorrect for the specified task. The problem requires computing the maximum beauty, defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n, after rearranging the elements of the array in any way. The current implementation fails to perform this calculation and instead outputs the sorted array, which is not the desired output.

For example, with the input:
```
3
2
2 1
```
The expected output is `1` because the maximum beauty of the array [2, 1] is 1 (rearranging to [1, 2] gives (2 - 1) = 1). However, the program will sort the array to [1, 2] and print "1 2", which is not the correct output format or value.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for the sorted array.

However, the current program only sorts and prints the array, which does not meet the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
