Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `f` is the second integer from the last input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the last input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers from the last input sorted in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the output is `NO`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then the output is `YES`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then the output is `YES` if `k` is the last index of the list or `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`; otherwise, the output is `MAYBE`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs `t` times, and `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be set to their values for the last test case, and `x` will be the value of the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. The final output will depend on the comparison between `a[k]` and `x`:
- If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the output will be `NO`.
- If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the output will be `YES`.
- If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the output will be `YES` if `k` is the last index of the list or the element at `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`; otherwise, the output will be `MAYBE`.
