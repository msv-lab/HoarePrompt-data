Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**
