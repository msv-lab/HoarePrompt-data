Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, where `distance` is the number of steps taken to reach `neighbor` from `start`. The `queue` will contain at least one element if there are still unvisited nodes in the graph. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited or the `queue` is empty.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `queue` will contain tuples of nodes and their distances from the `start` node, and the `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed. The `current` node will be the last node processed, and `dist` will be the distance from `start` to `current`. If the `target` node is found, the function will return the distance. If the `queue` is empty and the `target` has not been found, the loop will terminate.
