### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game continues as Eve removes one number at a time.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair has a zero XOR.
   - Specifically, the XOR of two identical numbers is zero, and the XOR of different numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) can be non-zero.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that have the same value, as removing a pair of identical numbers will not change the XOR of the remaining numbers.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s), the maximum number of pairs that can be removed is `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` respectively.
   - After removing these pairs, the remaining numbers are `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 2`, and `d % 2`.

5. **Remaining Numbers**:
   - If the sum of the remaining numbers (after removing pairs) is 3, it means there are three unpaired numbers left, which can be arranged to make the XOR zero.
   - This is because the XOR of three unpaired numbers (1, 2, 3) is zero.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remaining numbers is 3 and adds 1 to the total count if it is.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
   - The logic for counting pairs and checking the sum of remaining numbers is correct.
