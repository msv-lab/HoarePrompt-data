Output State: **The loop has executed `int(input())` times, and for each iteration `_` incremented from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. For each pair of input integers `n` and `k`, if `k` was 1, the program printed 1 and moved to the next iteration. If `k` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, the program printed the ceiling of `k / 2`. If `k` was greater than `2 * n`, the program printed `k // 2 + 1`. The values of `n` and `k` for each iteration were provided by user input and are not retained between iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
The loop has completed all the iterations specified by the user input. During each iteration, the loop variable `_` incremented from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`. For each pair of integers `n` and `k` provided by the user, the program performed the following checks:
- If `k` was 1, it printed 1 and moved to the next iteration.
- If `k` was less than or equal to `2 * n`, it printed the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- If `k` was greater than `2 * n`, it printed `k // 2 + 1`.

The values of `n` and `k` were reset for each iteration based on new user input, and they are not retained between iterations.
