Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
2. **`k`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
3. **`a` and `b`**: Lists of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\).
4. **`c`**: A list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
5. **`suff`**: A list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
6. **`i`**: Set to `k-1`.
7. **`ans`**: Initially set to positive infinity (`float('inf')`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initially set to positive infinity (`float('inf')`).

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Calculation of `suff`**:
   - `suff` is a suffix sum array of `c`.
   - `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - `suff[n]` is 0 (since there are no elements from index `n` to `n-1`).

4. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (initially positive infinity) and the values `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - This means `ans` will be the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value of the expression `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, k-1]`)**
