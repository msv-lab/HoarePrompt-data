Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. a is an input integer, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the value of `k` at the point the loop broke or the value of `j + 1` if the loop completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found, or the value of `j` if the loop did not find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is `b` if the loop completed, otherwise it is the index at which the loop broke. `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes or breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
