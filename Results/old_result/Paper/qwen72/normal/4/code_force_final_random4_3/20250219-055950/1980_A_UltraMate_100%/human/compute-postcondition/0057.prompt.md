Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'G'. `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
