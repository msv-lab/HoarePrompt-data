test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains four sublists, each sublist representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
