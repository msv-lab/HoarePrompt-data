The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it implicitly works with multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The function can make at most 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function returns indices based on the results of these queries.
