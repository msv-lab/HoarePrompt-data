The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. `x` represents the number of applications with a 1x1 icon, and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2x2 icon. The function returns the total number of icons on the screen, which is calculated as `x + 4*y` (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 times the space of a 1x1 icon).

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively. It returns the total number of icons on the screen, calculated as `x + 4*y`.**
