The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `cx`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `cx`. If `cx` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in `cx`, and `cx` must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the second element in `cx`, and `cx` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` contains all `x` inputs where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
