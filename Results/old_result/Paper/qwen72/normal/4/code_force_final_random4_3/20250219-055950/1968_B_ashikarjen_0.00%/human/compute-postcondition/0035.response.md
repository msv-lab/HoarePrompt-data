Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `j` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is now one step closer to reaching `m`, and the condition `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]` is still valid with the updated value of `j`.
