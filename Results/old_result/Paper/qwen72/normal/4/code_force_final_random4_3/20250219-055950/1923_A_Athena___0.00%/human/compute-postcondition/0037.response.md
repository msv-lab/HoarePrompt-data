Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user and `a[0]` is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**

The initial state specified that `a` is a non-empty list of integers where `a[0]` must be 0. After executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of the list `a` is removed, so `a[0]` is no longer 0. The length of the list `a` is now one less than before, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
