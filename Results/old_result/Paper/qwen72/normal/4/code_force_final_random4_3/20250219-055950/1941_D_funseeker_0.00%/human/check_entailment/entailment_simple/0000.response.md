Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining which players could have the ball after a series of throws, given the number of players, the number of throws, the initial player with the ball, and the distances and directions of the throws.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line from standard input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits a line of input and converts each part to an integer.
   - It then reads the details of each throw (distance `r` and direction `c`) using `func_1()`.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` who has the ball.

3. **Throw Simulation:**
   - For each throw, the program updates the set `ans` by considering the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to `temp` for the next iteration.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After all throws are processed, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as `0` represents the last player in the circle (player `n`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans` and then prints the players' numbers in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are correctly implemented to read and parse the input as described in the problem.

- **Correctness of Throw Simulation:**
  - The program correctly simulates the possible positions of the ball after each throw by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements when the direction is unknown ('?').
  - The use of the modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

- **Correctness of Final Adjustments:**
  - The adjustment to replace `0` with `n` is necessary because the problem states that players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be interpreted as `n`.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of those players.

### Potential Issues:
- **Recursion Limit:**
  - The recursion limit is set very high, but this is not necessary for this problem since there is no recursion involved. This line can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The program uses sets to keep track of possible positions, which is efficient and ensures that all positions are unique.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `c` is '?' and when `0` is in the final set.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly simulates the game and outputs the correct results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
