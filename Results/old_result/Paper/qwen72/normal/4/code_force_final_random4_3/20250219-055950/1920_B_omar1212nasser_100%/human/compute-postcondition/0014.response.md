The code snippet `s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]` updates the value of `s2` by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `negatives + i` evaluates to `negatives + 2`. Therefore, `s2` is incremented by the value of the element in `elements` that is `negatives + 2` positions from the end of the list.

Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` and minus the second last element in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` minus `elements[-i]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 2)]`, and `i` is 2.**
