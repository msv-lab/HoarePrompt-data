Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is now `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is assigned to be the value of `a[i + 1]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` is `n`.
- Therefore, `r` is now `a[n]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
