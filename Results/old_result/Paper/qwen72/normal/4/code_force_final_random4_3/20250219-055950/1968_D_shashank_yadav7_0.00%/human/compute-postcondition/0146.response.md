Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - 1`.
2. `k` is `k - n` (or `k` is `-1` if `k - n` is less than or equal to 0).
3. `b` is `p[p[...[p[b - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
4. `s` is `p[p[...[p[s - 1]... - 1] - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
5. `bm` is the cumulative result of `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations.
6. `sm` is the cumulative result of `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.
7. `sp` is `sp + sum(a[p[s] - 1] for _ in range(n))`.
8. `bp` is `bp + sum(a[p[b] - 1] for _ in range(n))`.
9. `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides a complex set of conditions and operations involving multiple variables and lists (`p`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `k`, `n`).
- However, the code snippet itself is very simple: it only contains a `print` statement with a fixed string `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will print the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the initial state and the complex operations described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bodya**
