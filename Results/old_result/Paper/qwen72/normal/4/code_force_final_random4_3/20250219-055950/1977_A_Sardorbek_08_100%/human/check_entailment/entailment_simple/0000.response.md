### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints "NO" because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), the program prints "Yes" because the difference between `b` and `c` can be made up by a combination of adding and removing cubes, which will always result in an even number of changes.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints "No" because the difference between `b` and `c` will be odd, and it is impossible to achieve an odd difference with an even number of moves.

3. **Logic:**
   - The logic correctly handles the cases where `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, and the parities of `b` and `c` are the same or different.
   - The program ensures that the output is "Yes" if the number of moves and the desired number of cubes have the same parity, and "No" otherwise.

4. **Output:**
   - The output is consistent with the problem description and the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and outputs the correct results for the test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
