Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `a`, `t`, `ii`, `i`, `n`, `y`, `rem`, and `r` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
