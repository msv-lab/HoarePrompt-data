Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)`. If `k` is 0, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * -1 + max(a[b] * -1, bp)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * -1 + max(a[s] * -1, sp)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now an input integer minus 2.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `bm` and `sm` are still dependent on the value of `k`, and if `k` is 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
