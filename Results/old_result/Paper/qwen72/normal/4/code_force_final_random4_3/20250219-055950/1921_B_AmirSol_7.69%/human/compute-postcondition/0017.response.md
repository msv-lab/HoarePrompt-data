The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`, and `counter` is increased by 1.
