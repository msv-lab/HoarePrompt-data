You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: `s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains the same, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where adjacent characters are different. If `flag` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`. If `flag` is 1, it indicates that there exists at least one position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string can be divided into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of cuts needed.
   - It initializes `flag` to 0, which will be used to check if the string is already sorted.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is different from the next character `s[i + 1]`, it increments `count`.
     - If the current character `s[i]` is less than the next character `s[i + 1]`, it sets `flag` to 1.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0, it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string by incrementing `count` whenever `s[i]` is different from `s[i + 1]`.
   - The `flag` is used to check if the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' comes after a '1').
   - If the string is already sorted (`flag` remains 0), the program prints `count + 1`, which is the correct number of pieces (since no cuts are needed).
   - If the string is not sorted (`flag` is set to 1), the program prints `count`, which is the number of cuts needed to separate the transitions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For a string with only one character (e.g., "1" or "0"), the program correctly prints 1.
   - For a string that is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" or "1111"), the program correctly prints 1.
   - For a string that requires cuts (e.g., "11010"), the program correctly identifies the transitions and prints the number of pieces needed.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the string is not sorted and ends with a '0'. For example, in the string "0110", the program will print 2, but the correct answer should be 3 because we need to cut the string into "0", "11", and "0" to sort it.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the string ends with a '0' and is not sorted. The logic for determining the number of pieces is flawed in this scenario.
