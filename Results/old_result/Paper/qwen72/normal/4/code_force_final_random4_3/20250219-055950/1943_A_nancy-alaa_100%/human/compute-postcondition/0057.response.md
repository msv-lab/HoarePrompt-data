Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 1. The conditions about `n` and `mpp` do not affect the value of `i` directly, and since `i` is 1, the print statement will simply output this value.

Output: **1**
