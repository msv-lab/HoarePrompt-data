Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n-1\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'2 %d' % i`. This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) into individual elements.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i` is \(n-1\).
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The formatted string `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 n-1'` where `n-1` is the value of `i`.
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'2 n-1'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n-1 is the value of `i` and n is the value of `n`)**
