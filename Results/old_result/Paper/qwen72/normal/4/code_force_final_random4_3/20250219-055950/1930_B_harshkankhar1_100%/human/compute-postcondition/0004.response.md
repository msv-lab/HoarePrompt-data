Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from user input, where 3 <= n <= 10^5, and creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It then reverses the elements at odd indices in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the modified list `a` with elements separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. **
