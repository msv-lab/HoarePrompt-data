You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which is not used within the function. It then reads 10 pairs of integers (each pair on a new line) and stores them in two lists, `x` and `y`. After collecting the inputs, the function iterates through these lists and prints each pair of integers in a sorted order, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` each contain 10 integers, and the function has printed 10 lines of sorted integer pairs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
   - It then initializes two empty lists `x` and `y` to store the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program uses a loop to read 10 lines of input, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should be determined by `t`, not a fixed number of 10.
   - For each line, it splits the input by spaces and converts the first and second elements to integers, appending them to the lists `x` and `y`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program then uses another loop to iterate over the 10 elements in the lists `x` and `y`.
   - For each pair of integers, it compares `x[i]` and `y[i]` and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.

### Issues:
- **Fixed Number of Test Cases**: The program always reads 10 lines of input, which is incorrect. The number of test cases should be determined by the value of `t` read from the first input line.
- **Range Mismatch**: The loop for reading and printing test cases is hardcoded to 10, which will cause issues if `t` is not 10.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, the program should read the number of test cases `t` and then use a loop that runs `t` times to read and process each test case.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The program would be correct if it read the number of test cases `t` and then processed `t` test cases.
- **False**: The program is incorrect because it always reads 10 lines of input, regardless of the value of `t`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
