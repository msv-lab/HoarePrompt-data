You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the user, each within the range 0 to 200. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if exactly three out of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant, and `t` is the number of test cases processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program calculates the number of pairs of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4) and adds an additional condition based on the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1, 2, and 3. However, this approach does not consider the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 2 2 1
```
The correct output should be 3, because Eve can remove one 4, and then the remaining sequence will have a bitwise XOR of 0, allowing Bob to win. However, the provided program will output 2, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly account for the optimal removal strategy, especially when the number of 4s is involved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
