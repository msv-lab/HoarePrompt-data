Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`.
- Given `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression becomes `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`.
- Simplifying this, we get `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- Since `right` and `left` are non-negative integers and `left` <= `right`, the value of `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
