Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` (i.e., `s1[n-1]`). If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decreased by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, `ol` is set to `totalOne` plus 1, `zr` is 0, `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi`, where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is updated to [0, `n`], `ol` is set to `totalOne`, `zr` is set to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `n` + 0 and `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` > `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.***
