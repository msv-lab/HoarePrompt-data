Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, and `r - l` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `mid = (l + r) // 2` updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is now specifically defined as `(l + r) // 2`.
