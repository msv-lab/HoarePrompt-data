Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations. `r` is `n`. `m` is less than `n`. `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input. `done` is an empty set. `extra` is an empty set. `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`r` is `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, `done` is a set containing the integer `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `n`, `m` is greater than 1, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`. `done` is a set containing the integer `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set. `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and, if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `a[1]` is also added to `extra`. `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r` is `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with `a[2]` removed if `a[2]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the integer `a[2]` if `a[2]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and, if `a[2]` is not in `todo`, `a[1]` and `a[2]` are also added to `extra`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
