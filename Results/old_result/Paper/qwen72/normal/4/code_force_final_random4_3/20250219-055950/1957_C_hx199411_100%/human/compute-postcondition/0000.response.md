The value of `t` is assigned the result of converting the input to an integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard.**
