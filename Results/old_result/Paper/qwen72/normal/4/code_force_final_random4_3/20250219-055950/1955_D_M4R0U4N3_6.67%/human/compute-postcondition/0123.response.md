Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, and the state of `done` and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`.**
