Postcondition: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `cur` is `low`, and the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`. Additionally, the current value of `p_1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`.**
