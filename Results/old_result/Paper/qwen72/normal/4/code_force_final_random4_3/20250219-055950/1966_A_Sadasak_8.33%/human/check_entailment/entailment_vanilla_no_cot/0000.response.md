Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Handling of `k > n` and `k == n` cases**: The program correctly handles these cases, printing `n` if `k > n` and `k - 1` if `k == n`. However, the `k == n` case is not necessarily correct. If `k == n`, it means you can perform one operation to exchange all `n` cards for `k-1` cards, which is `n-1` cards. So, the correct output for `k == n` should be `n - 1`.

2. **Frequency Calculation and Truncation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list and truncates it to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the problem does not require truncating frequencies to `k`. Instead, the program should determine how many operations can be performed based on the actual frequencies of the numbers.

3. **Final Output Logic**: The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not a correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be removed through operations and then subtracting this from `n`.

A correct solution would involve the following steps:
- Calculate the frequency of each number in the list.
- Determine how many full operations can be performed for each frequency.
- Calculate the remaining cards after performing all possible operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cards_left(n, k, nums):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate the number of full operations that can be performed
        full_operations = count // k
        # Calculate the remaining cards after full operations
        remaining_cards = count % k
        # Update the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards -= full_operations * (k - (k - 1))
    return min_cards

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cards_left(n, k, nums))
```

This corrected program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to calculate the frequency of each number. It then determines the number of full operations that can be performed for each frequency and calculates the remaining cards accordingly. Finally, it prints the minimum number of cards left after all possible operations.
