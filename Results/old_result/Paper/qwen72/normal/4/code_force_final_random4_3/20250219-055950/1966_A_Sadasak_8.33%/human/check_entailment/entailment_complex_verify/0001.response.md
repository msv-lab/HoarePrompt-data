### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed (you can't choose more cards than you have). This is correct.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards (which are exactly `k` cards) and get `k - 1` cards back, leaving you with `k - 1` cards. This is also correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - It ensures that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k` by setting it to `k` if it does. This is a valid step because if you have more than `k` cards of the same number, you can always perform the operation to reduce the count to `k`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `k` cards of that number and get `k - 1` cards back.
   - If no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, it prints `n` because no operation can reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Main Logic:**
  - The program's main logic is indeed flawed. It only checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. However, this does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.
  - For example, in the fourth test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`, and all cards have the number `1`, the program should be able to perform multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards to `3`. The current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach:**
  - A correct approach would involve either a dynamic programming solution or a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
  - For each card number, you should calculate how many operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after all possible operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further. It only checks for a single operation and does not account for the optimal sequence of operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
