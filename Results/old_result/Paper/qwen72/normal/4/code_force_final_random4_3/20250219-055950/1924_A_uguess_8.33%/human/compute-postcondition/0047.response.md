Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `tmp` to it.
- If the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- If the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 1, `tmp` remains an empty string, and `ans` is not changed.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
