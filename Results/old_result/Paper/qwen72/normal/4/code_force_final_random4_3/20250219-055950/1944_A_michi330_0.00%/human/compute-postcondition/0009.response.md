Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1 still holds. The new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the user input, and they will be integers.
