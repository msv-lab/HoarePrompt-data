Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that 2^i > x.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`x`**: This remains the same as the input integer, which is a positive integer not equal to 0 or 2.
- **`func_1`**: The function's purpose and constraints remain unchanged.
- **`subseq_lens`**: This list remains empty as the loop does not modify it.
- **`mx`**: This variable remains 0 as the loop does not modify it.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^i\) is greater than `x`. This means that the loop will stop when \(2^i\) exceeds `x`.

For example, if `x` is 10, the loop will stop when `i` is 4 because \(2^4 = 16\), which is greater than 10. If `x` is 100, the loop will stop when `i` is 7 because \(2^7 = 128\), which is greater than 100.
