Output: **NO**

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal `'NO'` that is passed to the `print` function.
