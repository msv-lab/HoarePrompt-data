For the `while True` loop, the condition is always true, and there are no specific variables or conditions in the loop head that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the program state remains unchanged, and the loop will continue to execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body based on the conditions provided.

State: **`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, the first element is a list `[num1, num2]` and the second element is also a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**
