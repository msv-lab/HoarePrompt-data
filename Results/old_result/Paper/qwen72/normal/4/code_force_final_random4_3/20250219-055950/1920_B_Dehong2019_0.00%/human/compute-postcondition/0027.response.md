Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`, `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`. Since `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `a[2 + x] * 2`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
