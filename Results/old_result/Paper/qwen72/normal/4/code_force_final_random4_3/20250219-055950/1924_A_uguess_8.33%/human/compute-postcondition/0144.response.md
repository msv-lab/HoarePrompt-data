Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tmp` is 'c'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The expression `chr(ord('a') + i)` converts the integer value `ord('a') + 2` to the corresponding character. Since `ord('a')` is 97, `ord('a') + 2` is 99, and `chr(99)` is 'c'.
- Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value 'c'.
- The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
