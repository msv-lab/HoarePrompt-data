Precondition: **The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.** 

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be:

```python
def func(p1, p2, p3):
```

Or, if handling multiple test cases within the function:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers (p1, p2, p3).
