To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `i` is \(n - 2\).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes.
   - If the loop breaks:
     - `k` is 0.
     - `y` is \(n - 1 - i\) (the number of elements remaining in the list after the break).
     - `rem` is \(k \% (i + 1)\).
   - If the loop completes without breaking:
     - `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions.
     - `r` is the last element of the list `a`.

2. **Given the loop conditions:**
   - If the loop breaks, `k` is set to 0, and `rem` is \(0 \% (i + 1)\), which is 0.
   - `y` is \(n - 1 - i\), which simplifies to \(n - 1 - (n - 2)\) = 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop breaks, the expression \((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y\) simplifies to \((r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 1\) = \((r - 1) * n + 2\).

3. **If the loop completes without breaking:**
   - `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `rem` is \(k \% (i + 1)\), which is \(k \% (n - 1)\).
   - `y` is 1 (since the loop completes without breaking, `i` remains \(n - 2\), and \(n - 1 - (n - 2)\) = 1).
   - Therefore, if the loop completes without breaking, the expression \((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y\) simplifies to \((r - 1) * n + 1 + (k \% (n - 1)) + 1\) = \((r - 1) * n + 2 + (k \% (n - 1))\).

Since the initial state does not specify whether the loop breaks or completes without breaking, we need to consider both scenarios:

- **If the loop breaks:**
  - Output: **(r - 1) * n + 2 (where r is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks)**

- **If the loop completes without breaking:**
  - Output: **(r - 1) * n + 2 + (k % (n - 1)) (where r is the last element of the list `a` and k is the remaining value after all subtractions)**

Given the lack of specific information on whether the loop breaks or completes, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 2 + (k % (n - 1)) (where r is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes, and k is 0 if the loop breaks or the remaining value after all subtractions if the loop completes)**
