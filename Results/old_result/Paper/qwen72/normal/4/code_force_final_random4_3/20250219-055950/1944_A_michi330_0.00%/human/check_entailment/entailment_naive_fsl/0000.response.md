Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still significant enough to isolate more than one island. Specifically, the program always prints \( n - 1 \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```

The program will output:
```
4
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```

If Dominater destroys 3 bridges, they can isolate 2 islands from island 1, leaving Everule with only 3 islands to visit (including island 1). The program fails to account for this optimal destruction strategy.
