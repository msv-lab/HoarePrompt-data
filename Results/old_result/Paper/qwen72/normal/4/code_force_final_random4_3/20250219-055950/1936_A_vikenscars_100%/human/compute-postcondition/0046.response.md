The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function is designed to handle integer inputs within the specified range and produce some output accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^4 and returns a value based on the input `n`.**
