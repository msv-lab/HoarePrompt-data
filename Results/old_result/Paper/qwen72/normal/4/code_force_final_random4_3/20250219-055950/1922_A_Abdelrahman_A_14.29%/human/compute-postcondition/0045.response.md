Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer. If `x` (the first character in `c`) is not present in `a` and not present in `b`, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
