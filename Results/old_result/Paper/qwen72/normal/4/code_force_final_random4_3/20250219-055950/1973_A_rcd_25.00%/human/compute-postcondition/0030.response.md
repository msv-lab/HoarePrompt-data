Postcondition: ***`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2` and the sum is even, `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`. If `p_3` is less than the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, the loop will have completed all iterations, and `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` if the loop did not break early. If the loop did break early, `cur` will be the value at which the condition `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` became true. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` will remain unchanged.***
