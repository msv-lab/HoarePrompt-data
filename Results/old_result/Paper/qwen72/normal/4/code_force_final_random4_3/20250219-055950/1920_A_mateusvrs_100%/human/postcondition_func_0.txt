The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the range of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case and returns the number of such integers. If the range is invalid (i.e., the maximum value for type 1 constraints is greater than the minimum value for type 2 constraints), it returns 0 for that test case. Otherwise, it returns the count of integers in the range that are not excluded by type 3 constraints. The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.
