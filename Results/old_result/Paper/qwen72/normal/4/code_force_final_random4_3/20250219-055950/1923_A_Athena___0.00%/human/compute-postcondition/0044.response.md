Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**

The last element of the list `a` has been removed, making the list one element shorter. The value of `i` is updated to reflect the new length of `a` minus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
