Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Natural language description:
- The `max_heap` list will contain `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The tuple will also include the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b` (either 0 or `m - 1`).
- The variable `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop and the loop runs `n` times.
- The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
