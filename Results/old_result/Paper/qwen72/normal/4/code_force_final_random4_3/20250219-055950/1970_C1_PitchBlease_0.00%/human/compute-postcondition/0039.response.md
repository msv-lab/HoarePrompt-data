The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queue` containing at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, the `queue` must have contained at least one element for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, where `distance` is the number of steps taken to reach `neighbor` from `start`. The `queue` will contain at least one element if there are still unvisited nodes in the graph. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited or the `queue` is empty. The `queue` must contain at least one element.**
