You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. For example: `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, where `count` is the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` was true during the loop execution.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, `gaps` is a list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (including the gap between the last and first elements if `x > 1`), where each gap is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i == x - 1` and `a[(i + 1) % x]` otherwise.
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least `x` elements, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, and `y` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final value after all iterations of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose, under the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
