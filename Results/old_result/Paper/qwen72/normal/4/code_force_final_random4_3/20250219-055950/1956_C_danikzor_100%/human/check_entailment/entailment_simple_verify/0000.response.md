Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( 2n \) operations: \( n \) operations of type 1 (setting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (setting columns).

3. **Formula for Maximum Sum**:
   - The program uses the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) to calculate the maximum sum.
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Verification of the Formula**:
   - Let's verify the formula for \( n = 2 \):
     - Correct formula: \( \frac{2^2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6 \).
     - Program's formula: \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \times (4 \times 2 - 1) // 6 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 // 6 = 42 // 6 = 7 \).
   - The program's formula indeed produces an incorrect result for \( n = 2 \).

5. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2, which is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).
   - Each operation sets a row or column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for performing the operations is correct.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output for the sum.

Final: **False**. The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The operations themselves are valid, but the sum calculation is wrong.
