Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`.
- Given that `i` is `n - 1`, substituting this into the equation gives `y = n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `y = 0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
