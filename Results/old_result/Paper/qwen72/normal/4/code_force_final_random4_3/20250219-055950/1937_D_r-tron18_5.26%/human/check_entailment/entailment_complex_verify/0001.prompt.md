You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`, where `s1` consists of characters '<' and '>' and has a length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string to calculate a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents a value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program includes the original string `s1`, the integer `n`, an empty list `preOne`, and a list `suffZero` containing cumulative sums of indices (1-based) of all '<' characters in `s1`, starting with 0. The list `ans` contains the calculated values for each index in `s1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on a different cell, and determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - The main function `func_2` processes each test case.
   - The program uses two helper lists: `preOne` and `suffZero` to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The `accumulate` function is used to create prefix and suffix sums of these positions.
   - The program iterates over the grid from right to left, calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific index based on `times`.
     - It is used to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - **Initialization**:
       - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
       - `totalOne` is the total number of '>' characters.
       - `preOne` is the prefix sum of the indices of '>' characters.
       - `suffZero` is a list to keep track of the cumulative positions of '<' characters.
       - `ans` is the list to store the results for each starting position.
     - **Iteration**:
       - The program iterates over the grid from right to left.
       - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
       - If the character is '>', it updates the `ans` list based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and the `ans` list.
     - **Output**:
       - The results are printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary data structures.
   - The logic for updating the `ans` list based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero` is complex but follows the rules of the problem.
   - The program handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball correctly.
   - The program ensures that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the grid is entirely '<' or '>'.
   - The program should handle the case where `n` is 1.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases efficiently.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The program iterates over the grid once, making it O(n) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the movement and inversion of characters, and it efficiently calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

Correctness: **True**
