Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4`. If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`. `remaining_cells` is now equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
