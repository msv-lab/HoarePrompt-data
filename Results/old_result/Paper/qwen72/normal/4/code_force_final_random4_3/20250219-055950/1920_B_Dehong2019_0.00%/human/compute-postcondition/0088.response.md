Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[2 + x] * 2`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[2]`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.***
