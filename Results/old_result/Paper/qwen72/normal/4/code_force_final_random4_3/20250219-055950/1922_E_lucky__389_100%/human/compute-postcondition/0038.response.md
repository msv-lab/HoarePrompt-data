Output State: **`x` is an input integer decreased by \(2^{(i - 1)}\), `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1. `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), and `i` is not equal to 0.**
