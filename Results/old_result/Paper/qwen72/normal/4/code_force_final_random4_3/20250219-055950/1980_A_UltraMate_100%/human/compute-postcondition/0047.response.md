The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `hmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `hmp`. If `hmp` has at least one key-value pair, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first key in `hmp` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum.**
