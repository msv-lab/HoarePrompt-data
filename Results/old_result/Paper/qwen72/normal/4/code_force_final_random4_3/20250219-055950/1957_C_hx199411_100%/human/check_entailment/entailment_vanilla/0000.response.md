### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player (you) places a white rook at a position \((r, c)\), and the computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and processes them.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks:**
   - The program counts the number of rooks already placed by the player and the computer.
   - If \( r_i = c_i \), the computer skips its turn, so only one rook is placed.
   - If \( r_i \neq c_i \), both the player and the computer place a rook, so two rooks are placed.
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the total number of rooks placed.

4. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - \text{num} \), which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where no rooks have been placed.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Configurations:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place one rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place two rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board without attacking each other.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`: This accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the two ways to place the mirrored rook.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is `dp[m]` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- It correctly counts the number of rooks already placed.
- The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
- The recurrence relation and base cases are correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
