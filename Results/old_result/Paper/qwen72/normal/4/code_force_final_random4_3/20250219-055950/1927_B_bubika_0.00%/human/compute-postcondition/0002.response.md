The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
