Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0, n - 2], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `oneInd` is set to `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
- Since `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, `preOne[-1]` is the sum of all indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- Therefore, `oneInd` is twice the sum of all indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
