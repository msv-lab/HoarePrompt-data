Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, tests is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b`, and all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`, `no` is True. Otherwise, `no` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`, then `no` is True. Otherwise, `no` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer. If `no` is True, it indicates that all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b`. If `no` is False, it indicates that `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or at least one character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
