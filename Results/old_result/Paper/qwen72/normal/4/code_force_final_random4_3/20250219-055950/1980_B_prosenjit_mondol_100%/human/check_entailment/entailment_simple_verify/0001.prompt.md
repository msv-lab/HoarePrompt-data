You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `f` is the second integer from the last input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the last input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers from the last input sorted in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the output is `NO`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then the output is `YES`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then the output is `YES` if `k` is the last index of the list or `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`; otherwise, the output is `MAYBE`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.

2. ** Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `x` using `a[f]`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparison:**
   - The function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the k-th cube after sorting (`a[k]`).
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The function prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond. The function then checks:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means the favorite cube is the last cube after sorting, so it will not be removed. The function prints "YES".
       - If `a[k + 1] < x`, it means the favorite cube is not in the k-th position but in a position beyond `k`, so it will not be removed. The function prints "YES".
       - Otherwise, the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond, so it may be removed or not. The function prints "MAYBE".

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `a[k] > x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is less than the value of the k-th cube after sorting. Therefore, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes and will not be removed.
- **Condition 2: `a[k] < x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is greater than the value of the k-th cube after sorting. Therefore, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes and will be removed.
- **Condition 3: `a[k] == x`**
  - This means the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting. The favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond.
  - **Sub-condition 1: `k == n - 1`**
    - If `k` is the last index, the favorite cube is the last cube after sorting and will not be removed.
  - **Sub-condition 2: `a[k + 1] < x`**
    - If the value of the (k+1)-th cube is less than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube is not in the k-th position and will not be removed.
  - **Sub-condition 3: `a[k + 1] == x`**
    - If the value of the (k+1)-th cube is equal to the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube could be in the k-th position or beyond, so it may be removed or not.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the values and positions after sorting.

### Correctness:
**True**
