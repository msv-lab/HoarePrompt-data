### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Reading Player Scores:**
   - For each test case, the function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players. The scores are sorted such that \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points: \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). This is correct because it represents the total number of games played, which must be an integer and even.
   - The function also calculates `y` as the sum of the two lowest scores: \( y = a + b \). This is correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred between the two lowest-scoring players.

5. **Determining the Result:**
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the result. This is intended to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the number of games played.
   - However, this approach has a flaw. The minimum of `x` and `y` does not necessarily represent the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. The correct approach should consider the distribution of points and the constraints of the problem more carefully.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No games were played, so no draws.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0 1 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: One game occurred, and it ended in a draw.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (3) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 2`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws. This is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the only valid scenario is one draw and one win/loss.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 3 3`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: The total points (9) are odd, so the scores are invalid.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `3 4 5`
  - Output: `6`
  - Reason: Six games occurred, with three draws and three wins/losses. This is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` because the only valid scenario is three draws and three win/losses.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1 1 10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: Two games occurred, both ending in draws, and the remaining points are distributed as wins/losses. This is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because the only valid scenario is two draws and the remaining points distributed as wins/losses.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- The total number of games played is \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} \).
- The maximum number of draws is the number of games where the points can be distributed such that the scores are valid.

The correct formula to determine the maximum number of draws is:
\[ \text{max\_draws} = \frac{a + b + c - (c - a)}{2} \]
This formula ensures that the points are distributed correctly and the number of draws is maximized.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        total_points = a + b + c
        max_wins = c - a
        max_draws = (total_points - max_wins) // 2
        
        print(max_draws)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a flaw in the calculation of the maximum number of draws. The corrected approach ensures that the points are distributed correctly and the number of draws is maximized.

Final: **False**
