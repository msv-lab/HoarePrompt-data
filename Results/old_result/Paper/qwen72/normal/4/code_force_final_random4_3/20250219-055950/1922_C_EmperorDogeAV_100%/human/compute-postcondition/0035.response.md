Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element at index i is either 1 if the city at index i+1 is closer to the city at index i than the city at index i-1, or the absolute difference between the city at index i+1 and the city at index i otherwise. The loop has completed all iterations, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `cities` list remains unchanged as a strictly ascending list of integers. The `prog_cities` list is now fully populated with integers. For each index `i` in `prog_cities`, if the city at index `i+1` in `cities` is closer to the city at index `i` than the city at index `i-1`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between the city at index `i+1` and the city at index `i`. The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
