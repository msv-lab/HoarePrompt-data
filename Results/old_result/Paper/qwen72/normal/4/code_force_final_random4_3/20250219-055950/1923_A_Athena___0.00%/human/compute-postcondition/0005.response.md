To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop head: `a and a[0] == 0`.

1. **`a`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list.
2. **`a[0] == 0`**: The first element of the list `a` must be 0.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `res` is 0

We need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty list and that its first element is 0. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`) are not involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check if `a` is a non-empty list**:
   - If `a` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, `a` must be non-empty.

2. **Check if `a[0] == 0`**:
   - If the first element of `a` is not 0, the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, `a[0]` must be 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must be a non-empty list.
- `a[0]` must be 0.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` must be 0, `res` is 0**
