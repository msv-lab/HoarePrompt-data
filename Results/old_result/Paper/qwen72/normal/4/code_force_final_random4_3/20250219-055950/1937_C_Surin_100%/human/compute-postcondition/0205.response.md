Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is `=`, then `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2.
   - Otherwise, if `r` is not `>` and not `=`, the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r` and possibly `r2`:
     - If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is `=`, then `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains unchanged (its initial state is not specified, so we assume it is undefined or some default value).

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 2.
     - Output: `? 3 3 2 2`
   - **Scenario 2:** If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is `<`, then `prev` is 2.
     - Output: `? 3 3 2 2`
   - **Scenario 3:** If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, then `prev` remains unchanged.
     - Output: `? 3 3 [prev] [prev]` (where [prev] is the value of `prev` before the condition checks)

Since the exact value of `prev` in the third scenario is not specified, we can only provide a general description for that case.

**Final Output:**
- If `r` is `>`, the output will be: **? 3 3 2 2**
- If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is `<`, the output will be: **? 3 3 2 2**
- Otherwise, the output will be: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev]** (where [prev] is the value of `prev` before the condition checks)

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is 2 if `r` is `>` or if `r` is `=` and `r2` is `<`, otherwise [prev] is the value of `prev` before the condition checks)**
