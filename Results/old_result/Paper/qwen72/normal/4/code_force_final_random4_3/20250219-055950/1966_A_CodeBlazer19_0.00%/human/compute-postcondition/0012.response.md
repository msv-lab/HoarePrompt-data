The `print(k - 1)` statement will print the value of `k - 1`, where `k` is an input integer provided by the user.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 2 (this does not affect the print statement directly).
- `i` is 2 (this does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n` is an input integer (this does not affect the print statement directly).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user (this does not affect the print statement directly).

The value of `k` is not explicitly defined, but it is an integer provided by the user. Therefore, the output will be the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer provided by the user)**
