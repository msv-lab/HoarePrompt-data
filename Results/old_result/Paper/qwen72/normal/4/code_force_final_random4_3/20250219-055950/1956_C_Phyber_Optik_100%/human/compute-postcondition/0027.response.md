The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n + 1` (exclusive), so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `sum` is 1 + (j + 1) * (2 * j + 1)
- `i` is `j` + 1
- `j` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `j` + 2
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 1 + (j + 1) * (2 * j + 1), `i` is `j` + 2, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
