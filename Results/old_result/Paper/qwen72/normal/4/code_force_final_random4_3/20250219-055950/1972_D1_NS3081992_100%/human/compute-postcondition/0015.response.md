Functionality: ** The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and returns the value of a sum minus 1. The sum is calculated by iterating over integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i` or `i > m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from the function `func_7` and are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The sum is the result of adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each valid `i`. **
