The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a new input string, `k` is 0, `j` is 0**
