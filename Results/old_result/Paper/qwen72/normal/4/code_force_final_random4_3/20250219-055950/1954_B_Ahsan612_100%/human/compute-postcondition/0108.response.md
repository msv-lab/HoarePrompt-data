Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 6 elements, `minn` is 1, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`, if `ar[3]` is equal to `num` then `same` is 2, otherwise `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, `i` is 6.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to be the sixth element of the list `ar` (since `i` is 6).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
