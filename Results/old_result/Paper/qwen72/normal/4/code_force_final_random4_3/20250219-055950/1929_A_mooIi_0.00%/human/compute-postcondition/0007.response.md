To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.

2. **Understanding `ar`:**
   - The input is a list of integers.
   - These integers are sorted.
   - The sorted integers are then converted to strings using the `map` function.
   - `ar` is a map object that contains these string representations of the sorted integers.

3. **`print(' '.join(ar))`:**
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the map object `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
   - The `print` statement will output this concatenated string.

Since `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, the `print` statement will output these strings joined by spaces.

Output: **" ".join(ar) (where ar is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input list)**

For example, if the input list of integers is `[3, 1, 2]`, the sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3]`, and the map object `ar` would contain `['1', '2', '3']`. The `print` statement would then output:

Output: **1 2 3**
