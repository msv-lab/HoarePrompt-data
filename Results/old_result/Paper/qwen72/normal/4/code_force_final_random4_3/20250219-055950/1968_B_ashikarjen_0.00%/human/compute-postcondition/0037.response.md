Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `j` and maintains the other preconditions.
