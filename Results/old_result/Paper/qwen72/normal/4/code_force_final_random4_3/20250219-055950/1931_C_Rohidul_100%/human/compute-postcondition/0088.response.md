Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is `n - st`, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `le - max(st, end)`.
- `le` is the length of the list `a`.
- `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal.
- `end` is `n - st`.
- The maximum of `st` and `end` is calculated, and `ans` is set to `le` minus this maximum value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`) remain unchanged.
