#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The list `cards` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element in `cards` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t` (the final value of `i` is equal to `t`), `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`. For each iteration, if the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, the program prints `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of a list of integers `l` and `k` is the number of cards to exchange. It then reads `n` integers from the input to form the list `l`. The function calculates the frequency of each unique integer in `l` and stores these frequencies in a list `p`. If the maximum frequency in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.
