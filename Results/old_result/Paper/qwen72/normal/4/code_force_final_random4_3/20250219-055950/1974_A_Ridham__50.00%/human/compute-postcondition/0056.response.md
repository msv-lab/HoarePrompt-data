Output State: **`n` is 0, `result` is a list containing the calculated number of screens required for each iteration. `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. For each iteration, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the value of `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated as `x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `(x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `n` will be 0, and the list `result` will contain the number of screens required for each set of `x` and `y` values provided during the iterations. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last set of inputs provided, and the variables `space_x`, `space_y`, and `total_space` will be based on these final values of `x` and `y`. For each iteration, the loop calculates the number of screens required to fit the 2x2 icons and checks if the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells. If they can, the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is added to `result`. If they cannot, the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons are calculated and added to the total number of screens, which is then appended to `result`.
