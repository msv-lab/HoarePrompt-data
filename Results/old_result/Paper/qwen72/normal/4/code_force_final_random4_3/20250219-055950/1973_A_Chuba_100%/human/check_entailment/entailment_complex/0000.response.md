### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input.
   - The function checks if the sum of these three integers is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`.

2. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` is designed to find the maximum number of draws.
   - `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` is the total points scored by the three players.
   - `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` is used to account for the scenario where the highest score `p_3` is more than the sum of the other two scores `p_1 + p_2`. This ensures that the highest score is not more than the sum of the other two scores, which would make the scores inconsistent.
   - The subtraction `p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` gives the total points that could have been distributed as draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws, as each draw results in 2 points being distributed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the sum is odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score with the given rules.
   - If the scores are consistent with the rules, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.
   - The formula used is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
