The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. Hereâ€™s the impact on the program and the updated values of the affected variables:

- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0.
- The last element of `preOne` is removed, which means the length of `preOne` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `oneInd` and `zeroInd` may be affected if they were calculated using the last element of `preOne`, but since the code snippet does not recompute these values, they remain the same.
- The value of `ans[n - 3]` is not recomputed, so it remains the same.

Output State: **`el` is the character at index `n - 3` of `s1`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all characters in `s1` that are '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, with an initial value of 0, but the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list with an initial value of [0], `ans` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `oneInd` is the same as before, `zeroInd` is the same as before, `ans[n - 3]` is the same as before.**
