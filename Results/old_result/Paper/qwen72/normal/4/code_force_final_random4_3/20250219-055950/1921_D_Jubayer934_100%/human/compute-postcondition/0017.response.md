The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the second element is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
