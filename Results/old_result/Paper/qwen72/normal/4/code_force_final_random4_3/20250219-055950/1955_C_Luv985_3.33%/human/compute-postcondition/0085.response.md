The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.**
