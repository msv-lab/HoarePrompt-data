Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `a`.
- An error occurs.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `z` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - An error occurs, but it is not specified where or what kind of error it is.

2. **Error Consideration:**
   - The error mentioned in the initial state could potentially occur before the `print` statement is executed. However, the `print` statement itself is simple and does not involve any variables or complex operations that could cause an error.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'1'`.
   - Since the `print` statement is a simple operation and does not depend on any variables or conditions that could cause an error, it will execute successfully.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, and `n`, and the error mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **1**
