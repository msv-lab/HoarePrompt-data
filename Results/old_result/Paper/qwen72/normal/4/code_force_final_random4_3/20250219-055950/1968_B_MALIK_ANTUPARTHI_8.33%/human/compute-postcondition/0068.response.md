To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `d` is an input value (which could be a list or any other iterable).
   - `e` is a new input value (which could also be a list or any other iterable).
   - `j` is `b - 1`.
   - `k` is the index of the last occurrence of any `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or `b` if no such occurrence is found or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` equaling `b - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a variable that is greater than 1, but it is not directly used in the `print(k)` statement.
   - `i` is 1, but it is not directly used in the `print(k)` statement.
   - `b` is an input integer, which is used to determine `j`.
   - `c` is an input integer, which is used as a condition in the loop.
   - `d` is an input value, which is indexed by `j` to find a specific element.
   - `e` is a new input value, which is searched for the last occurrence of `d[j]`.
   - `j` is calculated as `b - 1`.
   - `k` is determined based on the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or `b` if no such occurrence is found or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` equaling `b - 1`.

3. **Logic for Determining `k`:**
   - `j` is set to `b - 1`.
   - The code searches for the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e`.
   - If `d[j]` is found in `e`, `k` is set to the index of the last occurrence plus 1.
   - If `d[j]` is not found in `e`, or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` equaling `b - 1`, `k` is set to `b`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k` based on the conditions described above.

Since the exact values of `d` and `e` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the value of `k` as described.

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or `b` if no such occurrence is found or if the loop breaks due to `k` equaling `c` or `j` equaling `b - 1`)**
