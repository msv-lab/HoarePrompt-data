Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is updated to `(a[1] + 2) % n`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `present`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` remains the same: if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.
