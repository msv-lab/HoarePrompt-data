Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed and must still contain at least one tuple, `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item` that was popped from `max_heap`.
- All other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `item`) remain unchanged, but `ans` is now `ans + -item[0]`.
