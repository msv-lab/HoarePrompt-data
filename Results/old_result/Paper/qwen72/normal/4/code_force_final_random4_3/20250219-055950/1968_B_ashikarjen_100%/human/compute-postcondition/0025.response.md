Output State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` and `j < m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `j` is now `j + 3` and `j < m` and `b[j] != a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 3` (since it was previously `j + 2`).
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
