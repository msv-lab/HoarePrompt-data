The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains the first and second integers from `arr`, `ans` is 1**
