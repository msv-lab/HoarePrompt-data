The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**
