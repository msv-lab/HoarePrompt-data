Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function checks if any contiguous subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array `a`) is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the specified operation.
   - If no such subarray is found, it returns 'No'.

   The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
   - If an array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
   - By checking all possible contiguous subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a`, the function ensures that it covers all possible splits and swaps.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

   The function summary confirms that:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. The logic in `func_1` ensures that it checks all possible ways to split and swap the array to see if it can become sorted. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
