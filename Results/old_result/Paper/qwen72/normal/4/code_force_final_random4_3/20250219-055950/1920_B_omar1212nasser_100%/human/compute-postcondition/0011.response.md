To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`. The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, removals + 1)`, so the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`)

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `removals` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`elements`, `negatives`, `pos`, `s`, and `s2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, the conditions that were true at the end of the previous iteration should still hold.

State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `s - 2 * s2`, and the second element is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + 1)]`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `s2` and `i` remain unchanged.**
