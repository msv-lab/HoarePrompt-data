Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is 1. Additionally, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than `inf`, `minn` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
