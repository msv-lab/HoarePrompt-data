To determine what will be printed by the code snippet `print(p1 - x + p3)`, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is `p3 - 2` (though `y` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - x + p3`.
   - We know `x` is 2, so the expression simplifies to `p1 - 2 + p3`.

3. **Constraints and Values:**
   - `p1` is an integer such that `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3` and `p1` ≤ 30.
   - `p3` is an integer such that `p3 ≥ 4` and `p3 < p1 + p2`.
   - The sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - The expression `p1 - 2 + p3` can be rewritten as `p1 + p3 - 2`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `p1` and `p3` are integers and `p3` is at least 4, the smallest possible value for `p1 + p3 - 2` is when `p1` is 1 and `p3` is 4.
   - In this case, `p1 + p3 - 2 = 1 + 4 - 2 = 3`.
   - However, the sum `p1 + p2 + p3` must be odd, and since `p1` and `p3` are both integers, `p2` must be chosen such that the sum is odd. This means `p1` and `p3` must have different parities (one is even, the other is odd).

6. **Possible Values:**
   - If `p1` is 1 (odd) and `p3` is 4 (even), the sum `1 + p2 + 4` must be odd, so `p2` must be even.
   - If `p1` is 2 (even) and `p3` is 5 (odd), the sum `2 + p2 + 5` must be odd, so `p2` must be even.
   - The exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not fixed, but they must satisfy the given constraints.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The expression `p1 + p3 - 2` will print a value that is the sum of `p1` and `p3` minus 2.
   - Given the constraints, the value of `p1 + p3 - 2` will be an integer that is at least 3 (since the smallest possible `p1` is 1 and the smallest possible `p3` is 4).

Output: **p1 + p3 - 2 (where p1 and p3 are integers satisfying the given constraints: p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, p3 ≥ 4, p3 < p1 + p2, and the sum p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
