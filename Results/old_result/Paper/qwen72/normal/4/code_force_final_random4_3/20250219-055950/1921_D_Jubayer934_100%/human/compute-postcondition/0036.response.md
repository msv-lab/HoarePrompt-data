Output State: **`t`, `a_i`, `b`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user; `temp` is now -1; `ans` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list, overriding its previous value. The initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, and `temp` is now -1. The other variables (`t`, `a_i`, `b`) remain unchanged.
