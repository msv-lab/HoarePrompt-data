Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is calculating something that is not related to the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the problem statement. It calculates a sum involving the square root of `n` and some arithmetic operations, but this does not correspond to the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, but it expects two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem statement).

3. **Variable Mismatch**: The variable `k` is used in the function, but the problem statement uses `m` for the second integer. This is a naming inconsistency that could lead to confusion.

4. **Output Mismatch**: The output of the function is not the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a function that iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. However, it may not be efficient enough for large inputs due to the nested loops. For better performance, you would need to optimize the solution, but the logic is correct.
