Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, and `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `y = n - 1 - 1`, which is `y = n - 2`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `ii`, `n`, `rem`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
