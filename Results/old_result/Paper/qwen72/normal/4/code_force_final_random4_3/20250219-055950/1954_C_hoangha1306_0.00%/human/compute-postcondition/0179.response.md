To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the rules provided for constructing the strings `kq1` and `kq2`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `q` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `vt` is 0 or 1.
- `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of the same length as `a` and `b` where each character is determined by the rules specified in the loop.

### Rules for Constructing `kq1` and `kq2`:
- If `a[i]` == `b[i]` for any `i`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is either the smaller or larger of `a[i]` and `b[i]` based on the value of `vt` and the conditions in the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` and `b` are strings of the same length.
   - `i` is initialized to the last index of the strings `a` and `b` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`).
   - `vt` is either 0 or 1, which will determine how the characters in `kq1` and `kq2` are chosen when `a[i]` != `b[i]`.

2. **Loop for Constructing `kq1` and `kq2`**:
   - The loop iterates from the last character to the first character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `a[i]` == `b[i]`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is `a[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is determined by the value of `vt`:
       - If `vt` is 0, the smaller of `a[i]` and `b[i]` is chosen.
       - If `vt` is 1, the larger of `a[i]` and `b[i]` is chosen.
     - After choosing the character, `vt` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(kq1)` statement will print the string `kq1` constructed according to the rules above.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `kq1`. However, based on the rules, `kq1` will be a string of the same length as `a` and `b` where each character is determined by the rules specified in the loop.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string of the same length as a and b, and each character in kq1 is either the same as the corresponding character in a and b if they are equal, or the smaller or larger of the corresponding characters in a and b based on the value of vt)**
