To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the number of '@' characters in the string `b`.
   - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `j` is the last index of `b` (i.e., `len(b) - 1`).

2. **Condition:**
   - If `b` contains a '*', the loop breaks early, and `s` will be the count of '@' characters up to the first occurrence of '*' or the second consecutive '*' character.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the value of `s`:

- The variable `s` is initialized to count the number of '@' characters in the string `b`.
- If `b` contains a '*', the loop will break early, and `s` will only count the '@' characters up to the first occurrence of '*' or the second consecutive '*' character.

Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the value of `s` based on the given conditions:

- If `b` does not contain any '*', `s` will be the total number of '@' characters in the string `b`.
- If `b` contains one or more '*', `s` will be the number of '@' characters up to the first occurrence of '*' or the second consecutive '*' character.

Therefore, the output of the `print(s)` statement will be the count of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the specified conditions.

Output: **s (where s is the number of '@' characters in the string `b` up to the first occurrence of '*' or the second consecutive '*' character, or the total number of '@' characters if `b` does not contain '*')**
