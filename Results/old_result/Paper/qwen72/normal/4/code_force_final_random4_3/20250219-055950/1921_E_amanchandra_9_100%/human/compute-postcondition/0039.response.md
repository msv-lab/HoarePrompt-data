Postcondition: **`r`, `w`, `b`, `d`, `a`, `c`, `_` are assigned the integer values from the input. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. `x` is assigned the value `(abs(a - c) // 2)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` (i.e., if `abs(a - c)` is odd), `l` is `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is `min(w, d + (abs(a - c) // 2))`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, b + (abs(a - c) // 2))` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.**
