### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operations. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards for `k - 1` cards, leaving you with `k - 1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` but caps the frequency at `k` for any card number. This is done to ensure that the frequency table only contains counts up to `k`, which is the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged at once.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` in the frequency table.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange `k` cards of that number for `k - 1` new cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it prints `n` because no operations can reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- **Frequency Capping:**
  - The frequency capping in `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrect. The program should not cap the frequency at `k` because it needs to know the exact frequency of each card number to determine if an exchange can be made.
  - For example, if `k = 3` and a card number appears 4 times, the program should be able to exchange 3 of those cards, leaving 1 card of that number. Capping the frequency at 3 would prevent this from being detected.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check only considers if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after any number of operations, which means the program should consider all possible exchanges.
  - For example, if `k = 3` and a card number appears 6 times, you can exchange 3 cards twice, leaving 0 cards of that number. The current logic would not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach should involve calculating the total number of cards that can be exchanged and then determining the minimum number of cards left.
- For each card number, calculate how many full exchanges can be made (`freq // k`) and the remaining cards (`freq % k`). The minimum number of cards left is the sum of all remaining cards after all possible exchanges.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the frequency of card numbers and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after exchanges.

### Correctness:
**False**
