The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers representing the scores of three players, and they are sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30).

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, I will assume there is a missing part that should describe the output. However, based on the given constraints, the function likely processes these scores to return some result or perform an action based on the scores.

Given the constraints and the typical use of such functions, a possible output could be the highest score or a combination of the scores. However, without specific output details, I cannot definitively state the return value.

If you can provide the output details, I can complete the functionality description accordingly.

For now, I will describe the function based on the input parameters alone:
Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30).**
