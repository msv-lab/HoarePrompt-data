### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the array and query parameters for each test case.
   - The function is correct and behaves as expected for the given problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is true.
   - The function is correct and behaves as expected for the given problem.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and returns the result of `func_2` directly.
   - The function is correct but seems redundant since it does not add any new functionality.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is similar to `func_2` but adds 1 to the result if `func_2` returns a non-None value.
   - The function is correct and behaves as expected for the given problem.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function processes the main logic of the problem:
     - It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It reads the array `a` and initializes a cumulative XOR list `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store indices of cumulative XOR values.
     - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting by comparing the cumulative XOR values.
     - If the cumulative XOR from the start to `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start to `r`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence within the specified range that satisfies certain conditions using the `inds` dictionary and the `func_4` and `func_3` functions.
   - The function correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the input and queries as specified. The cumulative XOR approach and the use of the `inds` dictionary to efficiently check for interesting subarrays are appropriate and correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
