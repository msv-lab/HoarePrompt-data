Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop or if statement that this `break` statement is inside is exited and `first` is set to True. Otherwise, `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not 1, and the loop continues.***
