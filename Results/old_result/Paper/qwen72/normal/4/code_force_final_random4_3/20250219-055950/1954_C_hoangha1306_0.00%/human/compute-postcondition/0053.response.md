Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` is the smaller integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, `y` is the larger integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `kq1` and `kq2` are unchanged, `vt` is 1. If `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.***
