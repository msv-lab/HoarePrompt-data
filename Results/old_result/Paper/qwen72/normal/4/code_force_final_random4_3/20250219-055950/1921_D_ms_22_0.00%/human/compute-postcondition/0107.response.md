The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `a`. Given that `a` must have at least 2 elements and the loop has already executed for the second element, `a` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, the first tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` and the second tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the first tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and the second tuple is `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**
