You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case. For each test case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the loop prints `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, the loop calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` as the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, then prints `ans + p2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, it calculates and prints a result. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the result is `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, then computes `ans` as the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k` and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, and prints `ans + p2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Base Case (a >= b)**: If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price will yield the maximum profit in this scenario.

3. **Optimal k Calculation (a < b)**: If the usual price `a` is less than the modified price `b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price greater than or equal to `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation for Modified Prices**: The program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.

5. **Profit Calculation for Usual Prices**: The program calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` using the formula `(n - k) * a`.

6. **Total Profit**: The program correctly adds the two profits together and prints the result.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their minimum and maximum values. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
