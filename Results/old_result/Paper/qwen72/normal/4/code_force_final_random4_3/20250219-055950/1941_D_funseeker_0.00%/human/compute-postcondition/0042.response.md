Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`, regardless of the value of `c`.** 

The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The value of `c` does not affect this operation, so the condition about `c` being '1' or '?' is no longer relevant. The other variables (`ans`, `q`, `r`, `n`) remain unchanged.
