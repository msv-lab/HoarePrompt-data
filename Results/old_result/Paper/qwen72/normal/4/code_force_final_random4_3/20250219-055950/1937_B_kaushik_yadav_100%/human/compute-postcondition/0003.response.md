Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1.**

The value of `n` has been updated to an input integer within the specified range, while the initial state for `t` and the grid remains unchanged.
