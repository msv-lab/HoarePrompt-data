Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `t` is the total number of test cases, and `_` is `t - 1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If this condition is never met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and then prints `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`) remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30. For each test case, it performs the following actions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the score of the third player (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players (`p1 + p2`), it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop to find a point where `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such point is found, it prints `p3`. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case.
