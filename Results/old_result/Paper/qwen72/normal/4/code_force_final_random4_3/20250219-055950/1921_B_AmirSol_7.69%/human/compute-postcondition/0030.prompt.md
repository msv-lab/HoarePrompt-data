Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `counter` is 0, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. If `s1[0] != s2[0]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is 2, then `i` is less than `n - 1`, `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `s1[0] == s2[0]`, then `counter` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the characters at index `i-1` in `s1` and `s2` are the same.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and `n` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `s1[i] != s2[i]` and `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 2. Otherwise, if `s1[i] != s2[i]`, `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i] == s2[i]`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `s1[i] != s2[i]` and `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 2. If `s1[i] != s2[i]` but any of the other conditions are not met, `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i] == s2[i]`, `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
