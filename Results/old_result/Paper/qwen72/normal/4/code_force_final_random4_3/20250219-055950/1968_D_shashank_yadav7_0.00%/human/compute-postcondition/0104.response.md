Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
