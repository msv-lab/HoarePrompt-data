Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`.
   - `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ver, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `ver`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, the value of `ver` is known but not explicitly provided in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`)**
