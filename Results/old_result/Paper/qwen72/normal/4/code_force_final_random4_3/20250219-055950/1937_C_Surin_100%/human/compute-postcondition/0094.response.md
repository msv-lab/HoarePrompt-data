Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 1 if `r` is not `<`, otherwise `v1` is 2.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is determined based on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is not `<`, then `v1` is 1.
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2.
   - `v2` is explicitly given as 3.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - If `r` is not `<`, then `v1` is 1, so the output will be `'? 1 1 3 3'`.
     - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 2, so the output will be `'? 2 2 3 3'`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:

- If `r` is not `<`, the output will be `'? 1 1 3 3'`.
- If `r` is `<`, the output will be `'? 2 2 3 3'`.

Therefore, the final output is:

Output: **'? 1 1 3 3' if `r` is not `<`, otherwise '? 2 2 3 3'**.
