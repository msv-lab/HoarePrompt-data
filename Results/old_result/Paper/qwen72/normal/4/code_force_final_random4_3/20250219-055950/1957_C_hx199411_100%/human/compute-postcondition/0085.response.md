The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. If `m` is 0, the list `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is 1, the list `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m - 1` and the list `dp` is populated according to the given formula for each `j` from 3 to `m`.**
