Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears, `q` is greater than 0, and the value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the value of `x[r]`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next step of the program.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next step of the program. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
