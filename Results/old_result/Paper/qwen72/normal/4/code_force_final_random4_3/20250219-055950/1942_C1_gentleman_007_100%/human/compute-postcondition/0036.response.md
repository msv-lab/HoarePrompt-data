Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` will have been processed completely. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` will be set to `True`, and these nodes will be appended to `q` in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop will remain unvisited and will not be added to `q`.**

In natural language, this means that by the time the loop finishes, all the nodes in the adjacency list `graph[ver]` that were initially unvisited will have been marked as visited and added to the deque `q`. The order in which these nodes are added to `q` is the same as the order in which they appear in `graph[ver]`. Nodes that were already visited before the loop started will not be added to `q` and their visited status will remain unchanged.
