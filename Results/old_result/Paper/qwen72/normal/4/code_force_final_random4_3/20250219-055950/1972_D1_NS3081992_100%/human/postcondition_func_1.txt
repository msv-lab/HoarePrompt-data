The function `func_2` reads a line from the standard input buffer, splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
