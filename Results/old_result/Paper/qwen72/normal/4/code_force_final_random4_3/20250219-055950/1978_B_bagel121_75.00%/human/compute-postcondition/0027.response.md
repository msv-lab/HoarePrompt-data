Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case. For each test case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the loop prints `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, the loop calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` as the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, then prints `ans + p2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The loop runs `t` times, and after all iterations, `t` is effectively 0 because the loop has completed its execution.
- **`n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case**: For each iteration of the loop, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input. These variables are reset for each test case, so their values are not retained between iterations.
- **If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`**: The loop prints `n * a` and does not modify `n`, `a`, or `b`.
- **If `a` is less than `b`**: The loop calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` as the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`. It then prints `ans + p2`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the loop.

This output state reflects the final condition of the loop after all `t` iterations have been completed.
