### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the ticket prices `M` from the second line.
   - It then sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The ticket prices `M` are sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q`, which is the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets. This is done using `math.ceil(k / m)`, which ensures that if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, we account for the extra day needed.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This is stored in the list `N`.

5. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days (i.e., `n * m`) is exactly equal to `k`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase for each subsequent day.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is more than `k`, the program adjusts the calculation:
     - It pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day) and calculates the cost for the remaining tickets.
     - `mu` is the number of tickets that need to be bought on the last day, which is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - The cost is calculated as `mu * w` (the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day) plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on the other days, plus the additional cost due to price increases.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Sorting the Prices:** Sorting the prices in ascending order is correct because it ensures that we buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.
- **Calculating the Number of Days:** Using `math.ceil(k / m)` to determine the number of days required is correct.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation for the case where `n * m == k` is correct. It accounts for the total cost of buying `m` tickets each day and the additional cost due to price increases.
  - The cost calculation for the case where `n * m > k` is also correct. It correctly adjusts the number of tickets bought on the last day and calculates the additional cost accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly parses the input, sorts the ticket prices, calculates the number of days required, and computes the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

### Correctness:
**True**
