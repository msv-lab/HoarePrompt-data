Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the area of the square and prints it. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0, and the last processed square's coordinates and area calculation variables (`coord`, `p1`, `p2`, `res`) holding the state from the final iteration. **
