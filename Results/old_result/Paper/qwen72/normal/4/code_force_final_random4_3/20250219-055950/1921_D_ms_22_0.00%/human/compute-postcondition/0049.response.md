Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `ans + -item[0]`, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements from `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**
