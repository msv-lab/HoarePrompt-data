Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'C'. If `i` is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
