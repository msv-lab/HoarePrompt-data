Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string composed of characters from `a` at indices specified by `s`, in the order they appear in `s`**

Explanation:
- The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `s` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, so after executing the code, `s` is now a list of integers as input by the user.
- The other variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
- `a` is still 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- `b` is still a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` in `s` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`.
- `t` is still 1.
- `n` is still an input integer greater than 1.
- `r` is still a string composed of characters from `a` at indices specified by `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.
