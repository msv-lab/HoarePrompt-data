Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
