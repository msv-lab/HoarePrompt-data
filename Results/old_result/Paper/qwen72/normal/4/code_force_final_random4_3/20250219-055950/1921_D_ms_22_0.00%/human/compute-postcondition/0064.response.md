Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, and `ans` are updated such that `ans` is increased by `diff`. `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
