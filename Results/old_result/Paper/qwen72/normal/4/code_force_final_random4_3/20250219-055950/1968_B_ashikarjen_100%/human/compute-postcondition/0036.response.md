The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` must also be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time. 

- At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
- Since `j` is 1, for the loop to proceed, `m` must be greater than 1.
- The condition `b[j] != a[i]` must also hold true. Given that `i` is 2 and `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]`, `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[2]` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure `m` is greater than 1 and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[2]`.

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `b[1]` is not equal to `a[2]`**
