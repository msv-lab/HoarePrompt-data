The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of a list of integers `l` and `k` is the number of cards to exchange. It then reads `n` integers from the input to form the list `l`. The function calculates the frequency of each unique integer in `l` and stores these frequencies in a list `p`. If the maximum frequency in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.
