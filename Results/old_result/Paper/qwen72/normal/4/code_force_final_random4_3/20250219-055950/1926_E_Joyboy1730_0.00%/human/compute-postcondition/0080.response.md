The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in an empty list (which is 0), `k` is `k - tot` (which is `k - 0` or simply `k`), `pow` is `2^(t - 1)`, `a` is undefined because the list `L` is empty and the loop conditions cannot be met, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer.**
