You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The loop has completed its execution, so `i` is equal to `n`. The `counter` variable holds the number of positions in the strings `s1` and `s2` where the characters differ, and for each such position, if the next position (if it exists) also differs and the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different, then the `counter` is incremented by 1 for both positions, otherwise, the `counter` is incremented by 1 for each differing position.
    return counter
    #The program returns the value of `counter`, which is the number of positions in the strings `s1` and `s2` where the characters differ, with an additional increment for each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, plus an additional count for each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `counter`, which is the number of positions in the strings `s1` and `s2` where the characters differ, with an additional increment for each pair of consecutive differing positions where the characters in `s1` at these two positions are different.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
