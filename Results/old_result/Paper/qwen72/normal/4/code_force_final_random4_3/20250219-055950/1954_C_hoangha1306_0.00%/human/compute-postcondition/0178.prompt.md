Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, and `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and `vt` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are not the same, `x` is the smaller of the first digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the first digits of `a` and `b`, and `vt` is set to 1. `kq1` is set to the string representation of the smaller digit, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the larger digit. If `vt` was already 1 before the if-else block, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the larger digit, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the smaller digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length and at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, and `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[i]` == `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the string representation of the smaller or larger digit (depending on the value of `vt`) concatenated with the second character of `a`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, `x` is the smaller of the second digits of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the second digits of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to include the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to include the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, `kq1` is updated to include the digit `y` appended to its previous value, and `kq2` is updated to include the digit `x` appended to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length and at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated by appending the character at index 2 of `a` to their respective values, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the larger of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[2]` is greater than `b[2]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
