Output State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` is greater than 2, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `right - 1`.** 

The code snippet `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `right - 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
