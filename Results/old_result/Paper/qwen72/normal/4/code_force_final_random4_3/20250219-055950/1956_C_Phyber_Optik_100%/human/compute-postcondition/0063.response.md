Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2.**

**Natural Language Description:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached the value of `n`, which is the upper limit of the range in the loop. The other variables (`t`, `sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop. The loop will have printed pairs of lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, but the state of the variables will be as described above.
