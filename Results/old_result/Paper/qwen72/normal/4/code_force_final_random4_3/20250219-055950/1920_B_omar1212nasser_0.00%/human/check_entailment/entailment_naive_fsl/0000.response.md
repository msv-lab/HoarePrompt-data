Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the `func_2` function contains a hard-coded return statement that returns 0 when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This is not a general solution and will fail for other inputs where the optimal strategy might not result in a sum of 0. For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

However, for the input:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 100
```

Expected Output:
```
-100
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

The program incorrectly returns 0 due to the hard-coded condition, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for the given input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
