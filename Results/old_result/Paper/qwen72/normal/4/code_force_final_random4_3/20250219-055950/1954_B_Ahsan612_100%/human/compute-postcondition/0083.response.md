Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and 1. If `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` remains the same. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `same = 1` reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the value of `same` does not change. The states of the other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `i`, and `minn`) remain unchanged, but the condition for `minn` is updated to reflect the new value of `same`.
