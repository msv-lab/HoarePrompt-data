Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 2 or 3 if `ar[i-2]` == `num`, and `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to `ar[i]`.
- If `i` is 4, `num` becomes `ar[4]`.
- If `i` is 5, `num` becomes `ar[5]`.
- The value of `same` is still 2 or 3 if `ar[i-2]` == `num`, otherwise it remains 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
