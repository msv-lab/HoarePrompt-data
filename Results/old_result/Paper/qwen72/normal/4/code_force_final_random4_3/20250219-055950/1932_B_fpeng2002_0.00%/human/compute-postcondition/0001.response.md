The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer, and the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each `a_i` is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.

Given this context, `num_tests` should be set to a value that is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` should be initialized to `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0, and it should be initialized to `t` which is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
