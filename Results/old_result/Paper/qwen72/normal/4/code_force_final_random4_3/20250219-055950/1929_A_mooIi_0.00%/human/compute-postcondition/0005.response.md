Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted list of integers from the input, converted to strings.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to a new input integer, which is specified to be greater than 1. The other variables, `_` and `ar`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the initial state of `_` and `ar` the same.
