Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. `max_heap` is still an empty list, `t` is still `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are still input integers, `a` is still a list of integers input by the user, `b` is still a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is still 0, and `tp2` is still `m - 1`.
