Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check**:
   - The program checks the first subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - It uses sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that match and do not match the elements in `todo`, respectively.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window of length `m` over the array `a` from the second subsegment to the last.
   - For each new element entering the window, it updates the sets `done` and `extra` accordingly.
   - It also updates the sets when an element leaves the window.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` after each update, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, it prints the answer `ans`.

The logic and implementation are correct and handle the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively. Therefore, the program is correct.
