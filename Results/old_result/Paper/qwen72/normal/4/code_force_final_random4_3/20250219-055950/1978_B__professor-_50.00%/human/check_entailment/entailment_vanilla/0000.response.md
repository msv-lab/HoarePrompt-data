### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is \(\frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
     - The program correctly prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) in this case.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).
     - The program correctly prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) in this case.

3. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The program uses integer division (`int()`) to ensure that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and computes the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
