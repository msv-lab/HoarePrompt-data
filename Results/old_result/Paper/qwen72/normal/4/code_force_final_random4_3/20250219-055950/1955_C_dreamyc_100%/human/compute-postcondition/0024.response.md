Output State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 2]`. If `s_a` <= `a` and `s_b` <= `b`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `s_a` <= `a` but `s_b` > `b`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s_a` is updated by adding `nums[2]` to its previous value, which was already increased by `nums[1]`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `s_b` remains increased by `nums[n - 2]`.
- The conditions for updating `ans` remain the same based on the new value of `s_a` and the unchanged value of `s_b`.
