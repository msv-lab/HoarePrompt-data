The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n - 1` and going down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

Given that `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `suff[n - 1]` which is now `c[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`**
