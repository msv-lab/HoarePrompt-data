Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'C', `ans` is `m` if `i` is not a key in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m` added to its previous value (which was 0 if `i` was a key in `hmp`).**
