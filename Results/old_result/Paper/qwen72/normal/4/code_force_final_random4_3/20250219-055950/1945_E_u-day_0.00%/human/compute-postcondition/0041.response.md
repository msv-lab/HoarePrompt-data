Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `low + 1 >= high`.
   - `pos` is -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, otherwise it is the index of `k` in `arr`.
   - `st` is a set containing the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
   - `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `low + 1 >= high` implies that `low` is at least one less than `high` or equal to `high - 1`.
   - `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it is -1.
   - The print statement will output two values: `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `low + 1 >= high`, the value of `low + 1` will be at least `high` or greater.
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be the index of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be that index plus one.
   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will be -1, and `pos + 1` will be 0.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `low + 1` will be at least `high` or greater.
   - The value of `pos + 1` will be 0 if `k` is not found in `arr`, or the index of `k` plus one if `k` is found in `arr`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **[low + 1], [pos + 1] (where low + 1 is at least high or greater, and pos + 1 is 0 if k is not found in arr, or the index of k plus one if k is found in arr)**
