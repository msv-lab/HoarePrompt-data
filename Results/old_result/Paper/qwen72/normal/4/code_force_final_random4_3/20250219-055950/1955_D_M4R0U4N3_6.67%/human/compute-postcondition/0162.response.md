The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 2, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing only `a[0]`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is a set containing only `a[1]`, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 2.**
