Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the first element of `a` minus 2 times the second element of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts 2 times the second element of the list `a` (since `i` is 1) from the current value of `ans1`.
- The value of `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the first element of `a` minus 2 times the second element of `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
