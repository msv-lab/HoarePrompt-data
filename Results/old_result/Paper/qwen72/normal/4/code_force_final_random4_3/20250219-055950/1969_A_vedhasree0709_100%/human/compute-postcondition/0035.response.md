Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is n, and if the condition `l[l[i-1] - 1] == i` was not true for any `i` between 1 and n, then `j` is 0. Otherwise, `j` is 1.** 

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 0, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
