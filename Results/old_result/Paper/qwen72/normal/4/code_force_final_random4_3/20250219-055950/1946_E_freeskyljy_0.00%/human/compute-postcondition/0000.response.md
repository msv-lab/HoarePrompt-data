Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2), where n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), m_1 is the number of prefix maximums (1 ≤ m_1 ≤ n), and m_2 is the number of suffix maximums (1 ≤ m_2 ≤ n). Each test case is followed by two lists of integers: the first list contains m_1 distinct integers in increasing order (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing the indices of prefix maximums, and the second list contains m_2 distinct integers in increasing order (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) representing the indices of suffix maximums. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer.**
