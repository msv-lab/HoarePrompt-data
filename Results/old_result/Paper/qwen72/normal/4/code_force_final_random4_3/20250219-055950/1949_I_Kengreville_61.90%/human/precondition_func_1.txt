i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, r, visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of integers or booleans, each of length n. The elements of x and y represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, and the elements of r represent the positive integer radii of the disks. The list visited contains boolean values indicating whether a disk has been visited in the DFS traversal, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers used to store coefficients for the DFS traversal.
