The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least one more element to ensure the loop condition `i < len(a)` is still true.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, and `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
