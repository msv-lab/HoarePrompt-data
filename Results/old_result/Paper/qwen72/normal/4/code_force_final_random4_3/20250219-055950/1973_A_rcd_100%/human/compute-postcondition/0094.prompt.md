Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The number of test cases t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, no changes are made to `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if the loop condition `y >= x` is true and `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is also true, the output will be `p1 - x + p3`. If the loop condition `y >= x` is false, the output will be `p3`. The final values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented until either the loop condition `y >= x` becomes false or the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the loop breaks and the output is `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y < x`, and the output is `p3`. After all iterations, `x` will be `p3 - p2 + p1` and `y` will be `p2 - p1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If this condition is never met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and then prints `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
