Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element of `a`, and the current value of `container` is less than 0.**
