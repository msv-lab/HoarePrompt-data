### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` and increments `num` by 1 for such moves.
   - It increments `num` by 2 for moves where `r_i` does not equal `c_i`, which is correct because each such move results in two rooks being placed (one by the player and one by the computer).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, which are the base cases for the number of configurations when there is 1 or 2 remaining positions.

5. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation accounts for the two possible scenarios:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which leaves `i - 1` positions.
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in a different row and column, which leaves `i - 2` positions.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, counts the moves, calculates the remaining positions, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations. The recurrence relation and the base cases are correctly defined and applied.

### Correctness:
**True**
