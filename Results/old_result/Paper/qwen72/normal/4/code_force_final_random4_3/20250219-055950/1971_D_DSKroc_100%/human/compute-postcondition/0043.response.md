Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length at least 2, `i` is 1, `q` is `t`, and `t` remains the same. If the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]`, `count` is 2 and `flag` is 1. If `s[i]` is not less than `s[i + 1]` but `int(s[i])` is not equal to `int(s[i + 1])`, `count` is 1 and `flag` remains 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `flag` remains 0.***
