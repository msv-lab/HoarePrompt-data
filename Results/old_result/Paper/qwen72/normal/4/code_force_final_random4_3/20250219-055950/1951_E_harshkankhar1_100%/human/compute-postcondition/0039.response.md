The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `s` from the input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000. The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function returns nothing (i.e., it ends without returning any value).
