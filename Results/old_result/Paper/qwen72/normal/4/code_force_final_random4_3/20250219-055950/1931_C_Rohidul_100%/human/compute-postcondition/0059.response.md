Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is `l + 1`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.
- `st` is defined as `l + 1`.
- `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (l + 1 + end))`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`) remain unchanged.
