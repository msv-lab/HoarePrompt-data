Output State: **`L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a`, `k` is `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is `pow * 2`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `L`, `a`, or the updated `tot`.** 

The value of `pow` is doubled, while the other conditions and variable states remain as described in the initial state.
