Postcondition: ***`graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `q` now contains at least one element. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]` and `q` includes `node`, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` remains the next node in `graph[ver]` and `vis[node]` is not modified.***
