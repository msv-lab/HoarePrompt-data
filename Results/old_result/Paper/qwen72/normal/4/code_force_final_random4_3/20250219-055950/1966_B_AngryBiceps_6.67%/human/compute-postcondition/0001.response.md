Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, each greater than 0; `_` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, both `n` and `m` must also be greater than 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
