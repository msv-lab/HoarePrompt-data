For the `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always `True`, meaning that the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop executes the first time.

State: **`total` is 0, the function `func_1` does not take any input parameters, the input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1; the next n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge in the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `numbers` is an empty list.**
