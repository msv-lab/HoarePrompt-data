Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains at least 1.
- The variable `_` is still a placeholder and is set by the loop, but its value is not relevant to the final state.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `arr`, ensuring that the loop runs for the correct number of iterations.
- The loop index `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged and contains the integers provided by the user.
- The set `s` will contain all the elements from the list `arr`, with no duplicates.
