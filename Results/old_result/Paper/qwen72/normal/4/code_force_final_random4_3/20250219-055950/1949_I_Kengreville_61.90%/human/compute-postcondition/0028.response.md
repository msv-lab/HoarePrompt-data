Functionality: ** The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the disk at index `i`. If the disk at index `i` has not been visited, it marks it as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list. For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is exactly touching the disk at index `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`. The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and the `nodes` list, but does not change the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will have `True` for all disks that are part of the same connected component as the disk at index `i`, and the `nodes` list will contain the indices of these visited disks in the order they were visited. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated to reflect the coefficients for the disks in the connected component. **
