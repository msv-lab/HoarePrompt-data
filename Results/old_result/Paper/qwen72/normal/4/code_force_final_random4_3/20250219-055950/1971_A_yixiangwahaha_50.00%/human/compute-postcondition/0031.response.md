The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function is provided with two integers, `x` and `y`, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function's output is not specified in the given context, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function is expected to process these integers in some way during each iteration of the loop.

Functionality: **The function is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function processes two integers, `x` and `y`, where both `x` and `y` are between 0 and 9. The specific output of the function is not provided, but it is expected to handle these inputs in some manner.**
