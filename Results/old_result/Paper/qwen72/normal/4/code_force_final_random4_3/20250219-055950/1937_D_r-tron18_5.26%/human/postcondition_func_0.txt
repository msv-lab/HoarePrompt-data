The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where `0 <= times <= len(arr)`). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)`. If `times` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the last element and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`.
