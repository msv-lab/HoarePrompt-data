Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by the number of leading zeros), and `res` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the list `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is 0.
- Each iteration of the loop removes the first element of `a` if it is 0.
- After all iterations, all leading zeros in the list `a` will have been removed.
- The variable `i` is initially set to `len(a) - 1`, and it is reduced by the number of leading zeros removed.
- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
