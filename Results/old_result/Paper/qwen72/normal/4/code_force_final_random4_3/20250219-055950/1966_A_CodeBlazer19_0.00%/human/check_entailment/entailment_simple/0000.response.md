Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func()` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations, but it simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct solution. The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after the operations is missing. The program should count the frequency of each card number and then determine how many cards can be exchanged based on these frequencies. The correct output should be the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` cards with the same number, after performing the operations optimally.

Correctness: **False**
