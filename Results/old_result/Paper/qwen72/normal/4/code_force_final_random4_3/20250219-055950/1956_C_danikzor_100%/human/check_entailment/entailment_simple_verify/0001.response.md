Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The highest possible value for each element is \( n \), and since there are \( n^2 \) elements, the maximum sum is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).
   - However, the provided program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \). This formula is indeed incorrect for the problem's requirements. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n^3 \).

3. **Operation Count**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the program applies both types of operations to each row and column.

4. **Operation Details**:
   - The program uses the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both row and column operations.
   - This permutation ensures that the highest values are used, but it does not necessarily maximize the sum in the way the problem requires. The correct approach would be to use the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for both row and column operations to ensure that each element in the matrix is the highest possible value \( n \).

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program's output for the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum should be \( n^3 \).
   - The operations themselves are valid, but they do not achieve the maximum sum as required. Using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) will not fill the matrix with the highest possible values consistently.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum and does not fill the matrix with the highest possible values.

Final: **False**
