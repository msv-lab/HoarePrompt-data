Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 7 for each key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m` plus the sum of (`m - hmp[i]`) for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` < `m`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer.
- The variable `s` remains an input string.
- The variable `p` remains 'ABCDEFG'.
- The variable `hmp` remains a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 7 for each key in `hmp`.
- The variable `ans` is updated to be the initial value (the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`) plus the sum of (`m - hmp[i]`) for each key `i` in `hmp` where the frequency of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`.
