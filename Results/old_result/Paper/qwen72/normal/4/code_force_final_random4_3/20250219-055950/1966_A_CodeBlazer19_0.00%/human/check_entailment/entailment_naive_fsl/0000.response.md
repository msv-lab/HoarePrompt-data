Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. 

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (as shown in the example)
- Actual Output: `2`

However, for the third test case:
- Input: `7 2` and `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
- Expected Output: `1` (since you can exchange pairs of cards with the same number until only one card remains)
- Actual Output: `1`

But for the fourth test case:
- Input: `10 4` and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2` (since you can exchange groups of 4 cards with the same number until only 2 cards remain)
- Actual Output: `3`

The program fails to handle the logic of counting the occurrences of each number and determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
