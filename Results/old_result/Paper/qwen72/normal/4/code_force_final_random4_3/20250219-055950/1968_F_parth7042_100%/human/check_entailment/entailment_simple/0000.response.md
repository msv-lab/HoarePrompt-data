### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for competitive programming to optimize input reading.
   - The program then parses the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the number of elements `n` and queries `q` for each test case, and the elements of the array `a` and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the line `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - This is useful for quickly checking if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is 0, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and both indices are within the range `[l, r]`. This check is performed using binary search with `bisect_left`.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads and parses the input.
  - It handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description.

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated, ensuring that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.

- **Query Processing:**
  - The program correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is 0, which is a valid condition for the subarray to be interesting.
  - The binary search check for the existence of valid indices is also correct. If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match, which is a valid approach to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly formats and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
