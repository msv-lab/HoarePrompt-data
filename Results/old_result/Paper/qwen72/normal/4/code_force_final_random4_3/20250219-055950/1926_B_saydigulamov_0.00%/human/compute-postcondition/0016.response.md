Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: The list `k` will contain the count of '1' characters for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. If an input string `b` does not contain the character '1', it will not contribute to the list `k`.
- **`int(input())`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will run. After all iterations, the loop will have executed the number of times specified by the initial input.
- **`b`**: The variable `b` is used to store each input string during the loop, but its value is not retained after the loop completes. Each iteration of the loop reads a new input string, and `b` is updated accordingly.

The final state of `k` will be a list where each element is the count of '1' characters in the corresponding input string that contained at least one '1'. The length of `k` will be the number of such input strings.
