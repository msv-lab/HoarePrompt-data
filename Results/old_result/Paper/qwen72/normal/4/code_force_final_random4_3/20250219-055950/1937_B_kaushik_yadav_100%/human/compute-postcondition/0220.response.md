To determine what will be printed by the `print(counter)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions that affect the value of `counter`.

### Initial State:
- The loop has completed all iterations.
- `j` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `counter` is the final value based on the conditions inside the loop:
  - If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]` for all `j` in the range, `counter` will be `len(a) - 1`.
  - If any condition breaks the loop (i.e., `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `a[j + 1]` is not '0' and `b[j]` is not '1'), `counter` will be the value it reached before the loop was broken.
  - If the loop encounters a '0' in `a[j + 1]` and a '1' in `b[j]`, `counter` will be reset to 1 and the loop will continue.

### Analysis:
1. **If the loop completes without breaking:**
   - This means that for all `j` in the range, `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`.
   - In this case, `counter` will be `len(a) - 1`.

2. **If the loop breaks:**
   - This means that at some point, `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `a[j + 1]` is not '0' and `b[j]` is not '1'.
   - In this case, `counter` will be the value it reached before the loop was broken.

3. **If the loop encounters a '0' in `a[j + 1]` and a '1' in `b[j]`:**
   - `counter` will be reset to 1 and the loop will continue.
   - The final value of `counter` will depend on whether the loop completes or breaks after this reset.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `counter` printed will be either `len(a) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value it reached before the loop was broken, or 1 if the loop was reset due to encountering a '0' in `a[j + 1]` and a '1' in `b[j]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `counter`. However, we can describe the possible values based on the given conditions.

Output: **counter (where counter is the final value based on the conditions inside the loop: len(a) - 1 if the loop completes without breaking, the value it reached before the loop was broken if any condition breaks the loop, or 1 if the loop encounters a '0' in a[j + 1] and a '1' in b[j])**
