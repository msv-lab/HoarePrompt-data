The function `read` is intended to read input data, but the specific input format and types are not defined within the function itself. Based on the problem description, it is expected that the input will be provided in a specific format: the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, x (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player, respectively. The next m lines each contain an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the distance of the throw and the direction (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown).
