### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string `ans` by iterating through the grid.
   - It starts at the top-left cell and appends characters from `a` or `b` based on the conditions:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` and checks if the next character in `b` is smaller than the next character in `a`. If so, it switches to appending from `b` by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` and moves to the next cell.
   - This approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest path is chosen by prioritizing the top row (`a`) until a better option in the bottom row (`b`) is found.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program then counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It initializes `counter` to 1 and iterates through the grid to count the number of valid paths:
     - It increments `counter` if the characters in `a` and `b` are the same.
     - It resets `counter` to 1 if a '0' in `a` is followed by a '1' in `b`.
     - It breaks the loop if any character in `a` does not match the corresponding character in `b` and is not a '0' followed by a '1'.
   - This logic correctly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by considering the transitions between `a` and `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is entirely filled with '0's or '1's correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string. The logic and conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
