Let's break down the `print` statement step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a // 2`: This is the integer division of `a` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `b // 2`: This is the integer division of `b` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `c // 2`: This is the integer division of `c` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `d // 2`: This is the integer division of `d` by 2, which gives the quotient.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`: This is the sum of the remainders when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`: This checks if the sum of the remainders is equal to 3.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This converts the boolean result of the comparison to an integer (1 if true, 0 if false).

3. **Combining the Expressions:**
   - The `print` statement combines the integer divisions and the boolean check:
     ```python
     print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
     ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` adds 1 to the sum if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 is exactly 3. This means that all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` must be odd numbers.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd.

Output: **(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + 1 if a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3 else a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2)**

This means:
- If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all odd, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1.
- Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2.
