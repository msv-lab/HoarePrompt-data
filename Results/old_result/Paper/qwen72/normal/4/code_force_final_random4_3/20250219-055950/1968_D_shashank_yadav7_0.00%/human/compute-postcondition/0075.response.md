Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
