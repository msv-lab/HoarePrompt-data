Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`; `i` is `n-1`. Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is not 1, or the first string of `a` is equal to the last string of `a`.**
