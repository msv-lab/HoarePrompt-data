The objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, which means `arr` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
