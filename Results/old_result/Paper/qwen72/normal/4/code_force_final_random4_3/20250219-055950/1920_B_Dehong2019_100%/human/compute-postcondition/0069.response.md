Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[1]` from `ans1`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.
- The value of `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
