Output State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `s` is reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements` and by the value of the element at index `-i` in the `elements` list, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are within the bounds of the `elements` list, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `pos` is a list that now includes the value `s - 2 * n`.**

In natural language:
- `removals` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` remains 3.
- `s` is still reduced by the value of the second-to-last element in `elements` and by the value of the element at index `-i` in the `elements` list.
- `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are within the bounds of the `elements` list; otherwise, `n` is set to 0.
- The list `pos` now includes an additional element, which is the value of `s - 2 * n`.
