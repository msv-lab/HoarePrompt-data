Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first integer in `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR `2147483647`.**

Explanation:
- `s` is assigned the value of `i` XOR `check`. The value of `i` is the first integer in `data`, and `check` is `2147483647`. The result of this operation is stored in `s`.
- All other variables (`times`, `_`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`, `check`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
