Output State: **`i` is 1, the loop will iterate 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of the new `xylist` twice, `y` is a list that now includes the integer value of the second element of the new `xylist`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The loop will still iterate 10 times.
- `xylist` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string on spaces.
- The list `x` now includes the integer value of the first element of `xylist` twice, as the code `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` adds the integer value of the first element of `xylist` to `x` again.
- The list `y` remains unchanged and still includes the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.
