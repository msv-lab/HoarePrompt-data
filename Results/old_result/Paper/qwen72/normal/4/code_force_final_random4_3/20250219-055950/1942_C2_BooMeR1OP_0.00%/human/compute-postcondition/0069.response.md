Functionality: ** The function reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. It then calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and additional vertices, up to a maximum of `y` additional vertices. The function prints the final count of these triangles. The function does not return any value. **
