Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated based on the condition, `y` is updated accordingly, `r` is `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)`, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`.
- Therefore, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`.
- The values of `t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.
