Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to `((0 + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which simplifies to `((1 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
- The value of `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.
- All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
