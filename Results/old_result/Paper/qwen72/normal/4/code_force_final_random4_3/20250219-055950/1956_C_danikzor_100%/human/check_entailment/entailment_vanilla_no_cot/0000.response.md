Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it calculates the maximum sum incorrectly and the operations it performs do not achieve the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the solution `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The correct maximum sum for an n x n matrix, where each row and column can be filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to n, is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`. This is because each permutation of integers from 1 to n has a sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and there are n rows and n columns.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the solution are:
     - For each row i from 1 to n, it sets the row to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
     - For each column i from 1 to n, it sets the column to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - These operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, they create a matrix where each row and each column is filled with the same permutation in reverse order, which does not achieve the maximum possible sum.

To achieve the maximum sum, the correct approach is to use permutations that ensure each element from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix. One way to do this is to use the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for both rows and columns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This corrected version will correctly calculate the maximum sum and perform the operations to achieve it.
