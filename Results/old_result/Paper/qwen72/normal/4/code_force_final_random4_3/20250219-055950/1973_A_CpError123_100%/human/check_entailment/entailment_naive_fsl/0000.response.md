Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify when the scores are impossible to achieve given the rules of the game.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
According to the problem description, the scores `1 1 1` are impossible to achieve because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/lose scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario). However, the program outputs `1` instead of `-1` for this case, which is incorrect.

Another example is:
```
1
3 3 3
```
This is also an impossible case because the total points (9) are odd, but the program outputs `3` instead of `-1`.

The program should check if the total points are even and if the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
