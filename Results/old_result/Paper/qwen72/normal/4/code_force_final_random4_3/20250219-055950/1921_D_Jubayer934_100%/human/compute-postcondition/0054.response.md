The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is 2, so the specific elements being compared are `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The absolute difference `abs(a[2] - b[2])` is calculated and appended to `ans`.

The initial state specifies that `ans` already contains the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`. After appending `abs(a[2] - b[2])`, `ans` will contain three elements: `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, and `abs(a[2] - b[2])`.

The values of `t`, `a_i`, `temp`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1 or 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, and `abs(a[2] - b[2])`, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
