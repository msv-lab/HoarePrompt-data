The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string. If `r` == '>', `prev` is set to 2. If `r` == '=' and `r2` == '<', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
