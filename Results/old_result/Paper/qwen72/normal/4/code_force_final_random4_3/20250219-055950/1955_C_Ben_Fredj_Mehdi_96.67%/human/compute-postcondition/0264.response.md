Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2 and is odd, `i` is `k // 2 - 1` (or the loop could have broken due to an exception), `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by 1 for each successful iteration, `g` is incremented by 1 each time `a[g]` becomes 0, and `d` is decremented by 1 each time `a[d]` becomes 0. If an exception occurs, the loop breaks, and the values of `a`, `g`, and `d` remain as they were at the time of the exception.**
