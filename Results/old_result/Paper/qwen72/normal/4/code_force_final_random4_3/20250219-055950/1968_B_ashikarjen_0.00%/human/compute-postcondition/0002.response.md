Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, and `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

The value of `b` is updated to a binary string provided by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.
