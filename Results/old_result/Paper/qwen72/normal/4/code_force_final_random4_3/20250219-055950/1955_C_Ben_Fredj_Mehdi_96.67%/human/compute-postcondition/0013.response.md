The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('99')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`.
  - `t` must be greater than 0.
  - `z` is 0.
  - `a` is a list of integers.
  - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
  - `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and is explicitly set to 99999999999.
- However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not use any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'99'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'99'` as it is.

Output: **99**
