Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is `inf`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is set to `inf`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar` is now satisfied because `minn` is `inf`.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `minn` and retains the initial state of the other variables.
