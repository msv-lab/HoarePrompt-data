Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The new value of `cur` is one more than its previous value, and `high` must still be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.
