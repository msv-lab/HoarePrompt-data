Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, t is in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the appropriate parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.
