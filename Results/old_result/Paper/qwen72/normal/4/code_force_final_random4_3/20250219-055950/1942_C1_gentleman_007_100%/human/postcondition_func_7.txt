The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in `l`. Each element `p[i][j]` (for `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `m`) is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the position `(i-1, j-1)`. The first row and first column of `p` are initialized to 0.
