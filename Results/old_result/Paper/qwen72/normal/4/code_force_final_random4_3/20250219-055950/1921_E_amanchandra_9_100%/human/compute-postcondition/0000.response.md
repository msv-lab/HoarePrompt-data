The value of `t` is assigned the result of converting the user input to an integer. The conditions for `t` are that it must be within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The other parameters and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.**
