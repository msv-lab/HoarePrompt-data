You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp needs to send invitations to his friends such that at least 2 friends attend the party.
   - A friend \(i\) will attend if both \(i\) and their best friend \(p_i\) receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of invitations sent.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \(n\) and the list of best friends \(l\).
   - It initializes two variables: \(i\) (to iterate through the list of best friends) and \(j\) (to check if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found).

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the list of best friends using a while loop.
   - For each friend \(i\), it checks if \(p_i\) (the best friend of \(i\)) and \(q\) (the best friend of \(p_i\)) form a pair where \(q = i + 1\).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints 2 (since sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure they both attend) and sets \(j\) to 1 to indicate that a valid pair was found.
   - If no such pair is found after iterating through all friends, it prints 3 (since sending invitations to 3 friends is a safe minimum to ensure at least 2 attend).

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The program assumes that if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2. This is correct.
   - However, the program does not handle cases where no such pair exists but there are other configurations that can still ensure at least 2 friends attend with fewer than 3 invitations.
   - For example, in the case where \(p = [2, 3, 4, 1]\), the program will print 3, but it is possible to send invitations to friends 1 and 2, ensuring that both 1 and 2 attend, which is a valid solution with only 2 invitations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible configurations of friends and their best friends. It only checks for pairs and prints 3 if no pair is found, which is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.
