Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1). It then removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. The function prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last modified list with leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the last modified list `a`. **
