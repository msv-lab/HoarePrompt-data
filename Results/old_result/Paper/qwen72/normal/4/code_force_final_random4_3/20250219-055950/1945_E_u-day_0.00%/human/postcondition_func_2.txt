The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_1` and a list `arr` obtained from `func_2`. The function searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr` and prints a message indicating whether `k` was found. If `k` is found at index `low` in `arr`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the values `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low` is the index of the closest element less than or equal to `k` and `pos` is the index of `k` if found, or -1 if not found. The function also maintains a set `st` containing the midpoints calculated during the search process.
