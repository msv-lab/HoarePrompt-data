The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. Since `_` is not used in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
