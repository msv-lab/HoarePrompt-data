The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list. The state of `total_water`, `n`, `target`, and `container` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Before the loop starts, `water` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element of `a`**
