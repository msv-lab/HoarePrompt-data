Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has alternating elements correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the elements will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly counts the minimum number of consecutive same elements. The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove when the array has alternating elements.
