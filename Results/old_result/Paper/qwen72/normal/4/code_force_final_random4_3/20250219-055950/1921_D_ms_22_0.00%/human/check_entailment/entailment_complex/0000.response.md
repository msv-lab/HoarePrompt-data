### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `b` is sorted, which is a necessary step to ensure that the largest and smallest elements can be efficiently accessed.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap is used to store the differences between each element in `a` and the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - The heap stores tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference, `i` is the element from `a`, and `index` is the index in `b` (either 0 or `m-1`).

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program pops elements from the heap and checks if the index in `b` is still within the valid range (`tp1` to `tp2`).
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences using the current valid indices `tp1` and `tp2`.
   - It then adds the maximum difference to the answer and updates the indices `tp1` or `tp2` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm aims to maximize the total difference `D` by selecting the largest possible differences between elements in `a` and elements in `b`.
  - By sorting `b` and using a max heap, the program ensures that it always considers the largest possible differences first.
  - The heap is used to keep track of the best possible differences, and the indices `tp1` and `tp2` are used to ensure that each element in `b` is used at most once.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `n` and `m` are equal, and where all elements in `b` are the same.
  - It also handles cases where `b` has more elements than `a`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time, and there are `n` such operations per test case.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. The use of a max heap and sorting ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
