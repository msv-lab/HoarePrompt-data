Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least three elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 2 + `coef1[j]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is the third element in `nodes`, and `coef1` is a list where the first three elements are 1 and the rest are `None`, `c1` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `c1` is 2 + 1, which is 3. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
