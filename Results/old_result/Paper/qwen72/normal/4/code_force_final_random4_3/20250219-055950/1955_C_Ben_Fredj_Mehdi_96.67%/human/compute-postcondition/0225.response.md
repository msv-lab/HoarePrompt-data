The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('5')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is given as `print('5')`.
   - This statement prints the string `'5'` to the console.

3. **Variables and Objects**:
   - The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement only contains a string literal `'5'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **5**
