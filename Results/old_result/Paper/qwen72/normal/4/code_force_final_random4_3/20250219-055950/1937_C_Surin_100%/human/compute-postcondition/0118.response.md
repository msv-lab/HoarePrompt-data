Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is 0 or 1.
   - `kp` is `kp + 1` (but `kp` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `g` is 0 (but `g` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a technical detail that doesn't affect the value of the variables).

2. **Determining `v1`:**
   - If the previous `r` was `<`, then `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.

3. **Determining `prev`:**
   - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is `=`, `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.

4. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

Now, let's analyze the values of the variables:

- `v1`:
  - If the previous `r` was `<`, then `v1` is `n - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. Since `v2` is `n - 1`, `v1` will also be `n - 1` if the previous `r` was not `<`.

- `i`:
  - `i` is 2.

- `prev`:
  - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1.
  - If `r` is `=`, `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output:

- `v1` will be `n - 1` in both cases (whether the previous `r` was `<` or not).
- `i` will be 2.
- `prev` will be 1 if `r` is `>` or if `r` is `=` and the previous `r` was `<`. Otherwise, `prev` will be 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [n-1] 2 [n-1] [prev] (where [n-1] is the value of `n - 1` and [prev] is 1 if `r` is `>` or if `r` is `=` and the previous `r` was `<`, otherwise [prev] is 0)**
