Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements. `n` is 0 if `negatives + removals` exceeds the length of `elements`, otherwise it is the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)`. The list `pos` contains the values of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration, including the final value.**

In simpler terms:
- `s` starts as the sum of all elements in `elements` and is reduced by the sum of the last `removals` elements.
- `n` is updated to include the sum of the elements from `-(negatives + removals)` to `-(removals + 1)` if these indices are within the bounds of `elements`. If they are not, `n` is set to 0.
- The list `pos` contains the intermediate and final values of `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop.
