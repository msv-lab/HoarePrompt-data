Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 0, and the second character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, the second character of `a` is not '0' or the first character of `b` is not '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
