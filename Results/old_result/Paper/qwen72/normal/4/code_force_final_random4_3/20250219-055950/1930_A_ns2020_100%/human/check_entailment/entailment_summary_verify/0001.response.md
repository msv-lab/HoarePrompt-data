### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then erasing them.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers, as this ensures that the minimum values added to the score are as large as possible.

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - Sorting the list of integers is a valid approach because it allows us to pair the smallest integers first.
   - After sorting, the smallest n integers will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) of the sorted list.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A`.
   - It prints the sum of every second element starting from the first, which is `sum(A[::2])`.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` reads `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `A`, sorts `A`, and prints the sum of elements at even indices.
   - The function does not return any value, and it correctly handles multiple test cases.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Sorting**: The program correctly sorts the list `A`, which is essential for the optimal pairing strategy.
   - **Summing Every Second Element**: The program correctly sums every second element starting from the first, which corresponds to the smallest n integers in the sorted list.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program uses a `while` loop to handle multiple test cases, ensuring that it processes all `t` test cases as required.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. For example, if the input is `2 3`, the sorted list is `[2, 3]`, and the sum of the first element is `2`, which is the correct maximum score.
   - The program also handles the case where all integers are the same. For example, if the input is `1 1 1 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the sum of the first two elements is `2`, which is the correct maximum score.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum final score for each test case as described in the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
