Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` contains the integer `x`.***
