Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the loop is incorrect. The loop is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix after the operations. However, the formula used \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) does not correctly compute the maximum sum. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the numbers 1 to \( n \) in each row and column is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

2. **Operations Output:**
   - The operations output is also incorrect. The program is supposed to output a permutation for each operation, but it outputs the same permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) for all operations. This does not maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit, but the operations themselves are not correct.

To correct the program, you should:

- Calculate the maximum sum correctly.
- Output the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the correct operations to achieve it. Each row and column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\), which ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
