Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2 + 1]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, the conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff2`, and `ans` are still valid.**
