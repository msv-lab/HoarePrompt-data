Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`, and `cur` is 1.**
