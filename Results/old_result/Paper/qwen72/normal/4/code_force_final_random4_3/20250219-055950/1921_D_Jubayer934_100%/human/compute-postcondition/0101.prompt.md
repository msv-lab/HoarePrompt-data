You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `temp` is not -1, then `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, and `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
