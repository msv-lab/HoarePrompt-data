Output State: **`t` is a new input integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `t`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the new `s1` is equal to `t1`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**
