Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6**:
   - This means `s` is a string of lowercase letters, and its length is between 1 and 1,000,000.

2. **`n` is the length of `s`**:
   - `n` is the number of characters in the string `s`.

3. **`func_1(s[0:])` is True**:
   - This means that the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the entire string `s`.

4. **`i` is `n-1`**:
   - `i` is the last index of the string `s`.

5. **There exists at least one character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`**:
   - This means that not all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character. There is at least one character in the string that differs from the first character.

6. **`x` is the index of the first such character**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`.

7. **`func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True**:
   - This means that the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.

8. **`x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`**:
   - `x` is not the second character (index 1) and not the middle character (index `n // 2`).

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions provided are sufficient to ensure that the function `func_1` behaves as expected for the given substrings. The specific values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `x` are not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement, as the conditions guarantee that the function `func_1` will return `True` for the specified substrings.

Output: **YES**
