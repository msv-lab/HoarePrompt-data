Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It relies on two external functions, `func_10` and `func_15`. `func_10` is expected to return a non-negative integer `n`, and `func_15` is expected to return a non-negative integer each time it is called. The function prints `n` non-negative integers to the console, each followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` integers have been printed to the console, and the state of any external variables or functions used by `func_10` and `func_15` remains unchanged. **
