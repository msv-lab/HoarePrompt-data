The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `x`. `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value or conditions are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `x`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided.**
