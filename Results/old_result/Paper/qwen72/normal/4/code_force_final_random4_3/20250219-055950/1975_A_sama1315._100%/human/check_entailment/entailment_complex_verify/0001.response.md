### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these parts. This operation can be performed any number of times.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be cyclically shifted to form a sorted array, then it can be sorted using the described operation.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(a)` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by the described operation.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to create `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible cyclic shifts of the array.
   - If any subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be sorted by the described operation.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes' if such a subarray is found and 'No' otherwise.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the required format.
   - The state annotations provided are accurate and correctly describe the program's state at key points.

6. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key insights and the logic of both functions.
   - The assessment states that the functions are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
   - The annotations in the annotated code support the correctness of the functions, especially the logic in `func_1` and the input processing in `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
