Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `k % 2`, which means `t` will be 0 if `k` is even, and 1 if `k` is odd.
- All other variables (`a`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
