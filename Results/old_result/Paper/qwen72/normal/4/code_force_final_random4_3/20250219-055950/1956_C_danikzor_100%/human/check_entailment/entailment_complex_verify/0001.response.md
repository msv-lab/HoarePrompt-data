Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The provided program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - This formula is actually correct for the problem's requirements. Let's break it down:
     - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
     - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers squared is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (2n + 1)}{6} \).
     - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers cubed is \( \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \).
     - However, the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \) is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations, which is the correct approach for this problem.
     - The formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \) correctly calculates the sum of all elements in the matrix when each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

3. **Operation Count**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation is of type 1 or type 2, and the program applies both types of operations to each row and column.

4. **Operation Details**:
   - The program uses the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both row and column operations.
   - This permutation ensures that the highest values are used, and it does indeed maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - By applying the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to each row and column, the matrix will be filled with the highest possible values, which is the correct approach to maximize the sum.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program's output for the maximum sum is correct, as the formula \( \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6} \) is the correct way to calculate the maximum sum.
   - The operations themselves are valid and achieve the maximum sum as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct because it uses the correct formula to calculate the maximum sum and the operations it performs are valid and achieve the desired result.

Final: **True**
