Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `itest` is 2.
- The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true if:
  - `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.
- Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides conditions that must be true for the program to reach this point, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as long as the conditions in the initial state are met.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
