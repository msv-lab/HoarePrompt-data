### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and then reads `2n` integers from the input.
   - This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `A` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Sorting is a crucial step because it ensures that we can always pick the smallest possible pairs to maximize the score.

3. **Summing the Minimums**:
   - The function then prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`).
   - This approach is correct because, after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and summing these will give the maximum possible score. This is because each pair `(A[2i], A[2i+1])` will have `A[2i]` as the minimum, and summing these minimums will maximize the score.

4. **Decrementing `t`**:
   - The function decrements `t` by 1 after processing each test case, ensuring that it processes all `t` test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, sorts the list, and computes the maximum score by summing the minimums of the pairs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
