Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not met, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, and `i` is the last index where the loop executed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke. Additionally, `temp` is not -1, meaning the condition `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met for some index `temp`.**
