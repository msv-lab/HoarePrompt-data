Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20.
- `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and it is neither equal to `a` nor `b`.
- All characters in `c` are present in either `a` or `b`.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `no` is True.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
