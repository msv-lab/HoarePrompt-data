Output State: **The program returns `None`.** 

In this case, the return statement is provided without any expression or variable, which means the program returns `None`. This is the default return value for a function in Python when no value is explicitly returned. The variables `s`, `n`, `x`, and the function `func_1` do not affect the return value in this snippet.
