Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `root + 1`, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `cnt` is `root * root`, `ans` is increased by the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `root`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is at least 1.
- The variable `i` has incremented from 2 to `root + 1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `root` remains the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.
- The variable `cnt` has the value of `root * root`.
- The variable `ans` has been incremented by the sum of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each value of `i` from 2 to `root`.
