The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used for iteration and does not need to be adjusted, but it will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
