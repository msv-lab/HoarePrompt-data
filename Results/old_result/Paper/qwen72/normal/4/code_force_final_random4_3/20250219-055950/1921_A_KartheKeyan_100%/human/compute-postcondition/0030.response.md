The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the `range` value, which is 4. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `range` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `range` must still be 4.

State: **`i` is 2, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to `coord`.**
