Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is either 0 or `n // 2`, `r` is either `n` or `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `mid` is initially `n // 2`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `n // 2`, and `r` remains `n`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, `l` remains 0, and `r` is updated to `n // 2`.
- The code snippet `mid = (l + r) // 2` recalculates `mid` based on the updated values of `l` and `r`.
- Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions and the updated values of `l`, `r`, and `mid`.
