Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times and then appended with `tmp`, followed by the character `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to it.
- All other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `k`, `i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is a string that starts with the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, followed by `tmp`, and then followed by the character `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
