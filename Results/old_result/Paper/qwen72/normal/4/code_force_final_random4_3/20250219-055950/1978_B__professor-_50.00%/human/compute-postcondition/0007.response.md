To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used in the statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the `print` statement).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Formula in the `print` Statement:
The formula used in the `print` statement is:
```
int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This is a linear expression involving `b` and `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`: This is a quadratic expression that multiplies the result of the linear expression by `n` and then divides by 2.
   - `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`: The result of the quadratic expression is converted to an integer using the `int` function, which truncates the decimal part (if any).

2. **Understanding the Formula:**
   - The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` can be interpreted as a sum of an arithmetic sequence.
   - Specifically, it represents the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b - n + 1` and the last term is `b`.

3. **Arithmetic Sequence Sum:**
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
   - Here, the first term is `b - n + 1` and the last term is `b`.
   - Therefore, the sum is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times ((b - n + 1) + b) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)
     \]
   - This matches the formula in the `print` statement.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer value of the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b - n + 1` to `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b - n + 1` to `b`.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where b is greater than a, and the difference between b and a is greater than or equal to n)**
