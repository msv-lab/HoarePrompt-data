The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes the largest element (based on the negative difference) from the `max_heap` and assigns it to the variable `item`. The `max_heap` is a list of tuples, each containing a negative difference, an element from `a`, and an index from `b`.

Since the initial state specifies that `max_heap` is a list of `n` tuples, after executing this code, `max_heap` will contain `n-1` tuples. The exact value of `item` depends on the specific elements in `max_heap`, but it will be one of the tuples in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1` based on the initial conditions.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements from `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`.**
