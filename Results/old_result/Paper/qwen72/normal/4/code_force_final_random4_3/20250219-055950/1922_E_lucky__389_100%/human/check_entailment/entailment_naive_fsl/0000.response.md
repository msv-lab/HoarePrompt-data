Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `x` is a power of 2 correctly. According to the problem description, the program should find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the program subtracts `2 ** (i - 1)` from `x` and appends `i - 1` to `subseq_lens`, which can lead to incorrect results when `x` is a power of 2.

For example, if `x = 4`, the program will:
1. Set `i` to 3 (since `2 ** 3 > 4`), then subtract `2 ** 2` (which is 4) from `x`, making `x` 0.
2. Append `2` to `subseq_lens`.
3. Print the length of `subseq_lens` (which is 1) and the value `2`.

However, an array of length 1 with a single element `2` does not have exactly 4 increasing subsequences. The correct output for `x = 4` should be an array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences, such as `[0, 1, 2, 3]` (which has 4 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, `[0, 1, 2]`, `[0, 1, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `[0, 1, 2, 3]`).

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
