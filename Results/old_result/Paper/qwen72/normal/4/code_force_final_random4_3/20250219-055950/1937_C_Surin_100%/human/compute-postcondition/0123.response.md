Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0 or 1, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which was already mentioned as being flushed in the initial state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and all the variables retain their original values. The output buffer is still flushed, and no new information is added or modified by the code snippet.
