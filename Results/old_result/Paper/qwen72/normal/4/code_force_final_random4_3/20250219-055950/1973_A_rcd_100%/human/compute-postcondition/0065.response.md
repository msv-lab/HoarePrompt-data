Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2**

The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` have been updated to the integers provided by the user input. The conditions `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30 and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd still hold true. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
