Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
