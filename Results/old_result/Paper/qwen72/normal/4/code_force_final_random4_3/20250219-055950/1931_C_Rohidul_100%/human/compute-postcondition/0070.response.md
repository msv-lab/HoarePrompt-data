Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `end`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
