Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`. `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are new variables assigned the values from the input split by spaces, where `r` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, and `d` is an integer. If `a > c`, the program retains the initial values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. If `a <= c`, `x` is assigned the value `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c)` is odd, `l` is assigned the value `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is assigned the value `min(w, d + x)`. If `abs(a - c)` is even, `l` is assigned the value `max(1, b - x)` and `r` is assigned the value `min(w, b + x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. If `a <= c`, `x` is assigned the value of the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Otherwise, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and `l` is assigned the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value `(abs(a - c) // 2)`. If `abs(a - c)` is odd, `l` is `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is `min(w, d + (abs(a - c) // 2))`. If `abs(a - c)` is even, `r` is `min(w, b + (abs(a - c) // 2))` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
