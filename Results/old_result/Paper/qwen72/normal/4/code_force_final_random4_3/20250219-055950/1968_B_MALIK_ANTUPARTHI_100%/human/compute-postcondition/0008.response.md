Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `j` is 0, and the value `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k:].`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
- The initial value of `k` is 0, and the initial value of `j` is 0.
- The expression `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`.
- The new value of `k` is the index found plus 1, plus the original value of `k` (which is 0).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k:]` is still valid after the code execution.
