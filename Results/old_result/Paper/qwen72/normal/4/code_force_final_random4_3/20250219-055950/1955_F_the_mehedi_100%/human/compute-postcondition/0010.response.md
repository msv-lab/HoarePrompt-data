The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` is the second integer in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `x` will be the third integer in the list `a`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `cnt` is `cnt` + `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`**
