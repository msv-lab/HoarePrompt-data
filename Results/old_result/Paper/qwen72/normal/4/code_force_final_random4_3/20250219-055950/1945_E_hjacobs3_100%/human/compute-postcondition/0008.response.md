Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`. Otherwise, if `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `n // 2`.***
