Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 6 elements, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`. If `ar[5]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, and `num` is the fifth element of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, and `i` is 6.**
