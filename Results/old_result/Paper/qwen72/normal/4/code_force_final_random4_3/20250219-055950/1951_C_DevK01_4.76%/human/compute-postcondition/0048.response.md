Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `L`, `t`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N` remain unchanged.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `m * sum(N)` multiplies the sum of the first `q` elements of `M` by `m`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` calculates the product of `m` squared and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers minus 1, using integer division.
- The final value of `cost` is the sum of these two expressions.
