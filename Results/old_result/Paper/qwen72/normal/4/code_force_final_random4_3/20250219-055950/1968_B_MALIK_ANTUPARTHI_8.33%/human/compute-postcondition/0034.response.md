To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `d` is an input value (likely a list or some collection).
   - `e` is an input value (likely a list or some collection).
   - `j` is `b - 1`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that is found in the sub-list `e[k:]` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found or the loop is broken before the last iteration.

3. **Understanding the logic:**
   - We need to find the last element in `d` that is also in the sub-list `e[k:]`.
   - If such an element is found, `k` is the index of that element in `d` plus 1.
   - If no such element is found, or if the loop is broken before the last iteration, `k` is set to `b`.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Start with `k = 0`.
   - Iterate through the elements of `d` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `d[i]` (where `i` starts from `len(d) - 1` and goes down to 0):
     - Check if `d[i]` is in the sub-list `e[k:]`.
     - If found, set `k = i + 1` and break the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an element, `k` remains `b`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `k` will be either the index of the last element in `d` that is found in `e[k:]` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found or the loop is broken before the last iteration.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last element in `d` that is found in `e[k:]` plus 1, or `b` if no such element is found or the loop is broken before the last iteration)**
