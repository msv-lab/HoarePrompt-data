You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le {10}^{4}, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 \le n \le 100 and 1 \le a, b \le 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000. For each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. If `n` > 1, the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` has been printed. If `n` ≤ 1, `a` has been printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\). For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two values: `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1 or less, it simply prints the value of `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`) with the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining at the regular price (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs. For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints the price of one yogurt (`a`), as there is no promotion to consider. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
