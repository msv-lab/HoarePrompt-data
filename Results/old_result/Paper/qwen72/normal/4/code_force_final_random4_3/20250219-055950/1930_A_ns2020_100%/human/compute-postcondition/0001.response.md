For the given `while` loop to execute the first time, the loop condition must be true. The loop condition is `t`, which means that `t` must evaluate to a truthy value. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 5000, it is inherently a non-zero value, and thus, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the function should take two parameters: `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function should return a list of integers representing the maximum final score for each test case.**
