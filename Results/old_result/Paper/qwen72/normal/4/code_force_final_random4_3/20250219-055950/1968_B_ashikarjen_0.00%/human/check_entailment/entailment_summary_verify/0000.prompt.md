You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3

    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the number of matching characters between `a` and `b` in the order they appear, stopping when all characters in `b` have been checked or the end of `a` is reached. The function then prints the number of matches found for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the original input values remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` only processes a single test case and does not loop over the number of test cases `t` provided in the input. This means that if the input contains more than one test case, the program will only process the first one and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect output for the remaining test cases.

To fix this, the program should include a loop to handle each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
                j += 1
            if j < m:
                k += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        print(k)
```

This version correctly processes each of the `t` test cases.
