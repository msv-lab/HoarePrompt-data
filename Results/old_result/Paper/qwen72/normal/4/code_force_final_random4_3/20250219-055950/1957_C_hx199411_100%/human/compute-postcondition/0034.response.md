The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Given the initial state, let's calculate the new value of `dp[i]`:

- `i` is 3
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`

Substituting the values:
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = 7`

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 3, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7.**
