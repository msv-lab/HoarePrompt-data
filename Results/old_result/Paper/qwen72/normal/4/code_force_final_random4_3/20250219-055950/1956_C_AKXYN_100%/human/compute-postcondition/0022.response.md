The loop head in the given code snippet is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop iterates a number of times based on the input provided by `int(input())`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input value for the range function, which is not a variable but a function call that depends on user input. Since the input value is not stored in a variable, it cannot be adjusted between iterations. The loop control variable `_` is not relevant to the state of the program outside the loop and is not used in the loop head to control the loop's execution.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1
- `i` is 0

Since the loop head does not depend on any of these variables and the input for the range function is provided anew each time the loop is entered, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, except for the loop control variable `_` which is not relevant to the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0**
