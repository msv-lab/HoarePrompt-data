You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:

    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed (you can't choose more cards than you have).
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards (which are exactly `k` cards) and get `k - 1` cards back, leaving you with `k - 1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - It ensures that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k` by setting it to `k` if it does. This is a valid step because if you have more than `k` cards of the same number, you can always perform the operation to reduce the count to `k`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `k` cards of that number and get `k - 1` cards back.
   - If no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, it prints `n` because no operation can reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Main Logic:**
  - The program's main logic is flawed. It only checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. However, this does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.
  - For example, in the fourth test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`, and all cards have the number `1`, the program should be able to perform multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards to `3`. The current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach:**
  - A correct approach would involve either a dynamic programming solution or a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
  - For each card number, you should calculate how many operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after all possible operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further. It only checks for a single operation and does not account for the optimal sequence of operations.

### Correctness:
**False**
