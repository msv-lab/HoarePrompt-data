Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **_ is 0**: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4**: This variable `n` is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
3. **ar is a list of integers input by the user**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values of the elements in `ar` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.
4. **same is 1**: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
5. **num is the last element of ar**: This variable `num` is the last element of the list `ar`.
6. **i is len(ar)**: This variable `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
7. **minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1, and minn is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`**:
   - The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
   - `minn` is neither `inf` (infinity) nor equal to the length of `ar`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the value of `minn`:
- If the original `minn` was greater than 1, then `minn` will be updated to 1.
- If the original `minn` was less than or equal to 1, then `minn` will remain the same.
- Since `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`, it must be a finite value and not equal to `i`.

Therefore, the value of `minn` after the update will be the minimum of the original `minn` and 1. Since `minn` cannot be `inf` or `i`, the only possible values for `minn` are finite and less than `i`. The smallest finite value that `minn` can take is 1.

Thus, the `print(minn)` statement will print 1.

Output: **1**
