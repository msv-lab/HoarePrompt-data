The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `water`. The loop iterates over the elements of `a`, and `water` is the current element being processed. At the end of the previous iteration, `water` was the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `water` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `water - target`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `water` is the second element of `a`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**
