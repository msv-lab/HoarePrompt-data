Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.***
