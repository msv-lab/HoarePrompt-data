Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`. `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (i.e., both are either even or both are odd), then the program retains this state. If `b` and `c` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), then the program also retains this state.***
