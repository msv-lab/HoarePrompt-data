### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - `func_15()` is called for each test case to compute the number of valid pairs for the given \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Function `func_15()`:**
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the increment `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` do not directly reflect the required condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to count the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified using the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a\) must be of the form \(k \cdot b\) where \(k\) is an integer.

4. **Function `func_15()` Analysis:**
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an incorrect heuristic.
   - The increment `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
     - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
   - The function `func_15()` does not correctly compute this count based on the given logic.

#### Conclusion:
The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop condition and the way the answer is incremented do not reflect the required condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
