The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1 or greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged, but it must still be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.**
