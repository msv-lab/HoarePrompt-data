Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n-1\).

2. **Understanding the `res` Calculation:**
   - The formula for `res` is \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - This can be expanded as:
     \[
     \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying the formula inside the sum:
     \[
     (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) = 2i^2 + 3i + 1
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)
     \]

3. **Understanding the `n << 1` Operation:**
   - The `n << 1` operation is a bitwise left shift, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.
   - So, `n << 1` is \(2 \times n\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `res` and the value of `n << 1`.
   - `res` is the sum of the series \((2i^2 + 3i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `n << 1` is \(2 \times n\).

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be:

Output: **res, 2 * n (where res is the sum of (2i^2 + 3i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1 and n is the input integer)**
