To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's carefully analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `num` is the first element of `arr`.
- If `frequency_table[num]` > `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is updated to `k`.
- Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for num in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `arr`.
- The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over.
- The state of `arr` and `num` are the only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head.

### Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the first element of `arr`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in `arr`.
- The length of `arr` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `arr` remains a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100.
- `k` remains an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` remains a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `num` is the first element of `arr` from the previous iteration.
- `num` is now the second element of `arr`.
- The length of `arr` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first element of `arr` from the previous iteration as a key, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and the length of `arr` must be greater than 1**.
