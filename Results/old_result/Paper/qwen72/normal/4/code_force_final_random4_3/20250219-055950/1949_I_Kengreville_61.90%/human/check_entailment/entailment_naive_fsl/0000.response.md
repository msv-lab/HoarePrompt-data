Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to use a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the logic in the `dfs` function and the main function `func_1` is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **DFS Logic**:
   - The `dfs` function is supposed to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the way it updates `coef0` and `coef1` is not clearly defined and does not guarantee that the sum of radii will strictly decrease.
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the program does not correctly propagate the changes in radii to ensure that the sum of radii decreases.

2. **Sum of Radii**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sum of radii can be strictly decreased. It only checks if `c1 != 0`, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that the sum of radii decreases.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the disks are not connected in a single component. For example, if there are multiple isolated groups of disks, the program may incorrectly determine that it is possible to decrease the sum of radii.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
3 0 1
6 0 1
```
- The disks are arranged in a line with integer coordinates and radii, and they are tangent to each other.
- The program should determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

In this case, the program will output `YES` because it finds a non-zero `c1` value, but it does not actually check if the sum of radii can be decreased. The correct output should be `NO` because it is not possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
