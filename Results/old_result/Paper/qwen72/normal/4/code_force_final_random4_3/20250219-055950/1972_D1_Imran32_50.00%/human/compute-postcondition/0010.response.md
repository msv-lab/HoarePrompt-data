Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 4, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 16, `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `i * i`. Given that `i` is 4, `cnt` becomes 16.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `root`, and the increase in `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
