### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve exactly `c` cubes.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the parities of `b` and `c` are the same (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This is correct because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even. This ensures that the number of cubes can be achieved by a series of moves (adding or removing cubes).
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the parities of `b` and `c` are different, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even, and if they have different parities, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results in the correct format, either 'Yes' or 'No', which is acceptable as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly handles the input, processes each test case according to the problem description, and produces the correct output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
