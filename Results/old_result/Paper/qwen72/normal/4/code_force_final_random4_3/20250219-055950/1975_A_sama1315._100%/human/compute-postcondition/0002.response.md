Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `idx` is 0.** 

The variable `idx` is now initialized to 0, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `data`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
