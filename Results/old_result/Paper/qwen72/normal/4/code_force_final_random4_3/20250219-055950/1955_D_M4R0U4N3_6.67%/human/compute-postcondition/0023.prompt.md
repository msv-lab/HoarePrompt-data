Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0. If the first element of `a` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to remove the first element of `a`, and `done` is a set containing the first element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not in `todo`, then `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a`, and `done` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 1. If the second element of `a` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated to remove the second element of `a`, and `done` is a set containing the second element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is not in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the second element of `a`. Additionally, if the first element of `a` was in `todo`, `done` contains the first element of `a`. If the first element of `a` was not in `todo`, `extra` contains the first element of `a` and `done` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 2. If the second element of `a` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated to remove the second element of `a`, `done` is a set containing the second and third elements of `a`, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` if the first element of `a` was not in `todo`. If the second element of `a` is not in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the second element of `a` and possibly the first element of `a` if it was not in `todo`, `todo` is updated to remove the second element of `a` if it was in `todo`, and `done` is a set containing the second element of `a` if it was in `todo`, and possibly the first element of `a` if it was in `todo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
