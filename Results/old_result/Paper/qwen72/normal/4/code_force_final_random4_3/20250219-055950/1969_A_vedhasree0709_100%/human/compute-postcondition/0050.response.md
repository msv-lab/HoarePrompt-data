Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is the integer value of `l[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `l[p - 1]`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` remains 0. If `q` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
