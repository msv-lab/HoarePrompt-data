Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` and `space_x` is not divisible by 15.***
