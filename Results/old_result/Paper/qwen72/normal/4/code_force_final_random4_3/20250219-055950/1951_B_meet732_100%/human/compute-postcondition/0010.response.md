Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` contains the integer `i`; `c` is 0 if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 1; `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
