Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[x + x]`, `ans2` retains its value as described in the precondition.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[x + x]`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `x` is an input integer. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
