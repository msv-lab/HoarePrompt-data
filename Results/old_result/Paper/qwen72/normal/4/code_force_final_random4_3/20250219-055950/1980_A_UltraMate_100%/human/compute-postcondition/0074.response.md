Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `m`, and `i` is 'C'. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `i` is not in the input string `s` and `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `m`.***
