Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must be non-empty, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), `ss` is the second character of `s`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' if `cnt` was 1 and less than `n`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
