Output: **-1**

Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state and other variables described (such as `_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.
