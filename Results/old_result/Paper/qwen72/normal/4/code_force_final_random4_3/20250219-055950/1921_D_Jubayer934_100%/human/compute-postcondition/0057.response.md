To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from the value of `temp`.
2. **`temp`**: `temp` is the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true. Since `temp` is not -1, it must be a valid index within the range of `0` to `n-1`.
3. **`n`**: `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, and the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `temp` is not -1, the loop will execute at least once if `temp` is within the valid range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `temp` is a valid index and `i` starts from `temp`.

State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `temp`, and `temp` must be a valid index (0 <= temp < n)**.
