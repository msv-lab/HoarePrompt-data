Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal. According to the problem description, if `a` and `b` are both even and equal, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a different rectangle. For example, for the input `4 4`, the program should output `Yes` because Bob can cut the 4x4 rectangle into two 4x2 rectangles and then form a 2x8 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs `No` for this case.
