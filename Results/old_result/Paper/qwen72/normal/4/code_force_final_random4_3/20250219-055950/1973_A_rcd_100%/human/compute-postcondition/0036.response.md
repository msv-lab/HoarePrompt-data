The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
