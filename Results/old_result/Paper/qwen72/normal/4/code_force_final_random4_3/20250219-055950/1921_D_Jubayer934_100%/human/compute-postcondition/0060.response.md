Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, ..., and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, `n` is the number of elements in list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in list `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`, and `ans` now includes the value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.**
