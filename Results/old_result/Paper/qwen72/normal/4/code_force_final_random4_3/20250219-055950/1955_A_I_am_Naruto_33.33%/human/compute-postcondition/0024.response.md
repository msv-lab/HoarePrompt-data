The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might interact with or use external variables or inputs that are not directly passed as parameters. The constraints indicate that there is a variable `t` which is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and for each test case, there are variables `n`, `a`, and `b` which are integers such that \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\).

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on these inputs. However, given the constraints, it is likely that the function processes these variables in some way and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\). The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided.**
