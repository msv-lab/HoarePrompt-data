Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i` updates the array `arr` at the index `left + mid - i - 1`.
- Given that `i` is 0, the index becomes `left + mid - 1`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`, and since `i` is 0, the value assigned to `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `left + 1`.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `arr[left + mid - 1]`.
