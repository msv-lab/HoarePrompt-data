Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`, `g` is the number of times the first element of `a` has been decremented to 0 and `g` has been incremented, `d` is the number of times the last element of `a` has been decremented to 0 and `d` has been decremented. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
