You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: `t` is 0, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `temp` is not -1, then `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, and `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` in a specific order: initially, it pairs elements from the start of `a` with elements from the start of `b` in descending order. If at any point the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the difference with the current element of `b`, it switches to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the final state includes the processed lists `a` and `b` for each test case, and the list `ans` containing the absolute differences.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in array `b` is equal to `n`. In such a case, the program should consider all elements in `b` to maximize the difference, but the current implementation only considers the first `n` elements of `b` in reverse order, which might not always yield the maximum difference.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
6 5 4
```
The expected output should be 12, as Vasya can create the array `c = [6, 5, 4]` to maximize the difference:
```
D = |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9
```
However, the program will output 9, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the case where `m == n` and the elements in `b` are already in a descending order.
