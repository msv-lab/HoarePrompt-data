Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

The value of `tp2` is updated to `m - 1`, where `m` is an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
