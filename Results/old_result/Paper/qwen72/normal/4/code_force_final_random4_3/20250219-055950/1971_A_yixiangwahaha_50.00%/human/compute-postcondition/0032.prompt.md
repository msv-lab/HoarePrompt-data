You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, with 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 10 iterations, `i` is 9, the loop will have iterated 10 times, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the first element of the `xylist` from each iteration, and `y` is a list that now includes 10 integer values, each value being the second element of the `xylist` from each iteration.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `i` is 9, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the last input string on spaces, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers. For each iteration, if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is true, and the output is `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, the condition `x[i] < y[i]` is false, and the output is `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function processes two integers, `x` and `y`, where both `x` and `y` are between 0 and 9. The specific output of the function is not provided, but it is expected to handle these inputs in some manner.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
