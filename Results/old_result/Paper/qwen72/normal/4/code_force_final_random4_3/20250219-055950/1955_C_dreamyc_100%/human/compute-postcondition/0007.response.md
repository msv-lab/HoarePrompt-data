The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0**
