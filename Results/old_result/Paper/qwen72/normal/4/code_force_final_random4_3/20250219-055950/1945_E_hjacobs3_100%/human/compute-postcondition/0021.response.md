The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
  - `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{find} \leq n\).
  - `n` is the length of `array`.
  - `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` <= `find`.
  - `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`.
  - The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` are not directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output of this particular statement.

### Output:
Output: **1**
