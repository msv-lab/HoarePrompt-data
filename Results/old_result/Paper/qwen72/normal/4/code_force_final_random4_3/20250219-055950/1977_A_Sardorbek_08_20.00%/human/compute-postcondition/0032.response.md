Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
   - `a` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b` and `c` are input integers.
   - `q` is a tuple containing the values (`b`, `c`).
   - If `b` == `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
   - If `b` < `c`, then `b` is less than `c`.
   - If `b` >= `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `b` is not equal to `c`.
   - Additionally, if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`.
   - If `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`, then `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output: **Yes**
