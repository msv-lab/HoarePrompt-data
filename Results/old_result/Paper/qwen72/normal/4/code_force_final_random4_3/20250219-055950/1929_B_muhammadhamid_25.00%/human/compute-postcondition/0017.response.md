Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
  - If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the current values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
  - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - `n` and `k` are provided by the user.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` can be 1, less than or equal to `2 * n`, or greater than `2 * n`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the value of `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

3. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression `k // 2 + 1` performs integer division of `k` by 2 and then adds 1 to the result.

### Possible Values of `k`:
- **If `k` is 1:**
  - `k // 2` is 0 (since 1 divided by 2 is 0).
  - `k // 2 + 1` is 1.
- **If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`:**
  - The value of `k` can range from 2 to `2 * n`.
  - `k // 2` will be an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
  - `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer between 2 and `n + 1` (inclusive).
- **If `k` is greater than `2 * n`:**
  - The value of `k` is greater than `2 * n`.
  - `k // 2` will be an integer greater than `n`.
  - `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer greater than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The output will depend on the value of `k`:
  - If `k` is 1, the output will be 1.
  - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output will be an integer between 2 and `n + 1`.
  - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the output will be an integer greater than `n + 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the user-provided integer, and the result is 1 if k is 1, an integer between 2 and n + 1 if k is less than or equal to 2 * n, and an integer greater than n + 1 if k is greater than 2 * n)**
