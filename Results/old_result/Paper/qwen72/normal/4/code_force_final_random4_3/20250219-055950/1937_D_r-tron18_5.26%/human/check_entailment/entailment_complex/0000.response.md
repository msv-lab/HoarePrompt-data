### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and the element at a specific index determined by `times`.
   - The function is used to compute the cumulative effect of movements and inversions in the grid.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
   - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the `ans` list with the calculated times.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices in `pre`, starting with 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list with the cumulative sums of indices (1-based) of all '<' characters, starting with 0.
     - `ans` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.

   - **Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`.
     - For each character `el` in `s1`:
       - If `el` is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If `el` is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - The `ans` list is updated with the calculated times.

   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the string `s1` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
   - The use of cumulative sums and the logic to handle the inversion of characters and their positions is consistent with the problem description.
   - The final output matches the expected format and logic for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The use of cumulative sums and the handling of character inversions are appropriate and lead to the correct calculation of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
