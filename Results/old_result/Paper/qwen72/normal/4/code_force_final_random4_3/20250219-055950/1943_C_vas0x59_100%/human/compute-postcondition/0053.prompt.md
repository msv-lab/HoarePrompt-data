Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values. `ops` is an empty list. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 0. `i` is 0. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 1. `i` is 1. `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and must be at least 2. `i` is 2. `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`. `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
