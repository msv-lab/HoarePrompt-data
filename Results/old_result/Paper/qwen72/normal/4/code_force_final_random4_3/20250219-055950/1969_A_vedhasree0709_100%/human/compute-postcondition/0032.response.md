The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(3)
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - The condition `l[l[i-1] - 1] == i` was not true for any `i` between 1 and `n`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement: `print(3)`.
   - This statement prints the integer value 3.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - The value 3 is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **3**
