Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
