Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer input between 1 and 500, inclusive.
   - `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the values `1`, `i`, and the elements of the range `range(n, 0, -1)`.
   - `1` is a constant integer.
   - `i` is given as 2.
   - `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of integers from `n` down to 1, inclusive. This is because the range function with a negative step (`-1`) starts at `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value printed is `1`.
   - The second value printed is `i`, which is 2.
   - The third value printed is the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1, inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1, 2, n, n-1, ..., 2, 1 (where n is the input integer and the sequence is from n down to 1)**
