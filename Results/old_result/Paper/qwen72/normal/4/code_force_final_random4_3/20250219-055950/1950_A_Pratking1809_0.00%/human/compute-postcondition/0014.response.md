Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `q` must be greater than 1.
3. `i` is 1.
4. `mn` is 100.
5. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
6. If the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`.
7. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.

Given these conditions, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('STAIR')` statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print('STAIR')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, or `mn`.
- The statement only depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and the conditions they satisfy.

### Conditions:
- If `a < b > c` is true, then the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b > c`.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true, and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('STAIR')` statement will always be executed regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` because the conditions provided do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string 'STAIR'.

### Final Output:
Output: **STAIR**
