The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
