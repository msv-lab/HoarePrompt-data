Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the ASCII value of the second character of `s` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it, storing the result in `cur_ss`.
- The value of `cur_ss` is now the position of the second character of `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
