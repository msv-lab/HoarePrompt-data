Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The value of `q` is not provided in the initial state, so it remains unknown.
- The value of `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- The value of `n` is one of the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `temp` was initially empty, and now it contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
- All other variables (`m`, `x`, `ans`, `_`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
