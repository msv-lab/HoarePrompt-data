You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, `n` and `q` satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, respectively, and for each query, `l` and `r` satisfy 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The elements of `a` are integers in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero or if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i < j ≤ r` and the XOR of the subarray `a[i+1]` to `a[j]` is zero. If either condition is met, the function appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results, with each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be divided into multiple parts with the same XOR value, but the parts are not contiguous. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
```

For the query (1, 5), the subarray is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This subarray can be divided into parts [1, 4] and [2, 3, 5], both of which have a bitwise XOR of 5. However, the program will output "NO" for this query because it checks for the presence of the prefix XOR values in the map but does not correctly handle the condition where the XOR of the subarray can be split into multiple parts with the same XOR value.

The program assumes that if the prefix XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are the same, the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value. However, this assumption is incorrect for the case where the subarray can be split into non-contiguous parts with the same XOR value. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
