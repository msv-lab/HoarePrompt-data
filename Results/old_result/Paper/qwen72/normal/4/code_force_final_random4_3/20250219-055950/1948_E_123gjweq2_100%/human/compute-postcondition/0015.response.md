Output State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `arr[left]` are filled with `small_element + i` to `small_element + 0` respectively, `cliquess[left + i]` to `cliquess[left]` are all set to `clique`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` sets the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`.
- Given `i` is 0, the expression `left + mid + i` simplifies to `left + mid`.
- Given `big_element` is `right + 1` and `i` is 0, the expression `big_element - i` simplifies to `right + 1`.
- Therefore, `arr[left + mid]` is set to `right + 1`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
