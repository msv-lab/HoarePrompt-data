Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `l` was 1, it becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
