Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2.
   - `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input sorted in descending order.
   - `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **YES**
