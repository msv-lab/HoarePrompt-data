Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case. This approach ensures that the program finds the most cost-effective way to buy the required number of yogurts, considering both the regular and promotional prices.
