The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, with conditions `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.**
