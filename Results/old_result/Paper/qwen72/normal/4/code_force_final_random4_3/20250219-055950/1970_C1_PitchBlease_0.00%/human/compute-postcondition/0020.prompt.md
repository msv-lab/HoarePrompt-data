Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, 1)`, `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`, and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. In both cases, `current` is equal to `start` and `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `tree[start]` must have at least one more neighbor. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and the tuple `(neighbor, 1)` is appended to the `queue`. Otherwise, `neighbor` remains in the `visited` set and the `queue` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
