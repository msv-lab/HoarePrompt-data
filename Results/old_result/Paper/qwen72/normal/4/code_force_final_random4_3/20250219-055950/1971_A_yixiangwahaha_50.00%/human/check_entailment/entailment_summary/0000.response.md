Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it in the logic, which is a deviation from the problem description that specifies `t` should be used to determine the number of test cases. Instead, the program always reads 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. This can lead to incorrect behavior if `t` is not 10, as the program will either read more or fewer inputs than required, and the output will not match the expected number of test cases.

Additionally, the program uses a fixed range of 10 for both the input collection and output printing, which is not flexible and does not adapt to the actual number of test cases provided by `t`.

Correctness: **False**
