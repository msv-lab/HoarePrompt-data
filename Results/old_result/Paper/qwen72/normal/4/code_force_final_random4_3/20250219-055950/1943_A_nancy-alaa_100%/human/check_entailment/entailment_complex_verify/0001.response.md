### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob only removes the chosen element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to add the smallest missing integer to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest missing integer from `a` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is present only once.
   - If an integer `i` is not in `arr`, it is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
   - If an integer `i` is present only once and it is the first such integer encountered (i.e., `first` is `True`), it is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered a number that appears only once in `arr`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `arr`.
   - The program also correctly identifies the smallest integer that is present only once.
   - However, the logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob is flawed.

5. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where both Alice and Bob are playing optimally. Specifically, it does not ensure that Bob will remove the smallest missing integer if it is present only once.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered a number that appears only once, but it does not account for Bob's optimal play.
   - The program should ensure that if an integer `i` is present only once, Bob will remove it, and the next smallest integer will be the MEX.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine the MEX correctly, we need to ensure that Bob will always remove the smallest missing integer if it is present only once.
   - The correct approach would be to:
     - Count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
     - Iterate through the range from 0 to `n` and find the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is present only once.
     - If an integer `i` is not in `arr`, it is the MEX.
     - If an integer `i` is present only once, it will be removed by Bob, and the next smallest integer will be the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. It fails to ensure that Bob will remove the smallest missing integer if it is present only once. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: **False**
