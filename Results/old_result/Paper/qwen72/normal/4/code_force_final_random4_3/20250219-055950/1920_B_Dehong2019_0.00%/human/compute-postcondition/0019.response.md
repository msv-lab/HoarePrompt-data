Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
