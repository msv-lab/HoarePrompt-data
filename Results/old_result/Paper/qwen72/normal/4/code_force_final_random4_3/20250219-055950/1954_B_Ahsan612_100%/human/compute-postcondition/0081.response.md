Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` remains the same. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to `n` based on user input.
- The values of `_`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `minn` remains the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
