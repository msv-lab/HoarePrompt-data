Postcondition: ***`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `x` is assigned the value `(abs(a - c) // 2)`. If `abs(a - c)` is odd, `l` is `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is `min(w, d + (abs(a - c) // 2))`. If `abs(a - c)` is even, `r` is `min(w, b + (abs(a - c) // 2))` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.***
