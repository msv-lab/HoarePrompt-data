Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The conditions that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` is still valid.
