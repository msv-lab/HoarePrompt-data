Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, and `cx` now contains `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is still the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` still contains `x`.
