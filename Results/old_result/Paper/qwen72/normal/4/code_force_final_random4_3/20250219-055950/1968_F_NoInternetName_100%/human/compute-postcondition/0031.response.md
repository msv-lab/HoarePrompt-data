Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`**:
   - `n` and `q` are integers. The exact values depend on the implementation of `func_1(int)`, but they are returned from this function.

2. **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers, each of which is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\).

3. **`x` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index**:
   - `x` is a list where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that index. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]`, then `x = [0, 1, 3, 0]` because:
     - `x[0] = 0`
     - `x[1] = 0 ^ a[0] = 0 ^ 1 = 1`
     - `x[2] = x[1] ^ a[1] = 1 ^ 2 = 3`
     - `x[3] = x[2] ^ a[2] = 3 ^ 3 = 0`

4. **`inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element in `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices in `x` where that key appears**:
   - `inds` is a dictionary where the keys are elements from `x`, and the values are lists of indices where these elements appear in `x`. For example, if `x = [0, 1, 3, 0]`, then `inds` might look like:
     - `inds[0] = [0, 3]`
     - `inds[1] = [1]`
     - `inds[3] = [2]`

5. **`i` is incremented by 1**:
   - `i` is initially some value, and it is incremented by 1. The exact initial value of `i` is not specified, but it is incremented by 1.

6. **`q` is greater than the new value of `i`**:
   - After incrementing `i`, `q` is still greater than the new value of `i`.

7. **`l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`**:
   - `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`. The exact values depend on the implementation of `func_1(int)`.

8. **`upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` or 0 if no such index exists**:
   - `upper` is determined by looking at the list of indices where `x[l - 1]` appears in `x` and finding the largest index that is less than or equal to `r`. If no such index exists, `upper` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `upper` are not directly printed by the `print` statement, but they are part of the precondition and affect the state of the program.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Yes'`.
Output: **Yes**
