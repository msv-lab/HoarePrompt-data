The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that any subsequent calls to `input` will now read a line from the standard input.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and the grid are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1. The `input` function now reads a line from the standard input.**
