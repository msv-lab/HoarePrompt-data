Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set that must contain at least three elements, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`, and `q` is the third element in `ans`. If `c` is not '0' or '?', `temp` is unchanged.***
