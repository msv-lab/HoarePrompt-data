Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` and calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - It prints the result of `func_2` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It takes `removals` (k), `negatives` (x), and `elements` (a) as parameters.
   - It has a special case where if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This special case is not justified by the problem description and seems to be an arbitrary condition.
   - It calculates the sum of the elements (`s`) and the sum of the last `negatives` elements (`n`).
   - It then iterates over the number of possible removals (from 1 to `removals`), adjusting the sum `s` by removing the largest elements and adjusting `n` by considering the next largest elements for negation.
   - It appends the calculated values to a list `pos` and returns the maximum value from this list.

3. **Optimality**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find the optimal sum by considering different scenarios of removals and negations, but the special case `(removals == 6 and negatives == 3)` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

4. **Special Case**:
   - The special case in `func_2` where it returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 is not justified by the problem statement. This could lead to incorrect results for specific test cases where the optimal sum is not 0.

5. **General Case**:
   - The general approach in `func_2` is to consider the sum of the array after removing the smallest elements and negating the largest elements, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - However, the special case mentioned above could cause the function to return an incorrect result for certain inputs.

Given the presence of the special case that does not align with the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
