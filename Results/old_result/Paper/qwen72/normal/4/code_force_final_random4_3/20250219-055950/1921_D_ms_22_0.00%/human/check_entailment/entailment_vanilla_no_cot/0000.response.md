Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic of the program is to maximize the total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a_i \) and Vasya's array \( c_i \) by selecting \( n \) elements from the sorted array \( b_i \) such that the absolute differences are maximized.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), followed by the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The array \( b \) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the most extreme values (smallest and largest) that can maximize the differences.
   - A max heap (using negative values to simulate a max heap with Python's `heapq` which is a min heap) is initialized to store the potential differences and their corresponding indices in \( b \).

3. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element in \( a \), the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \).
   - The larger of these two differences is pushed into the max heap along with the original element from \( a \) and the index of the element from \( b \) that produced the larger difference.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to ensure that the selected elements from \( b \) are used efficiently.
   - If the index of the element from \( b \) that produced the largest difference is outside the current range of available indices (from \( tp1 \) to \( tp2 \)), the program recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest available elements in \( b \).
   - The program then adds the maximum of these recalculated differences to the total difference \( ans \) and updates the pointers \( tp1 \) and \( tp2 \) accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The total difference \( ans \) is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program always selects the elements from \( b \) that maximize the total difference \( D \), and it handles the constraints and multiple test cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
