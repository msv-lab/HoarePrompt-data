To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than `st + 1`
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the next two elements (i.e., `a[r - 1]` and `a[r - 2]`) are also equal
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is `st - 1`
- `r` is `n - 3`
- `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`
- `end` is 3

We need to ensure that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Condition `r > l`**:
   - `r` is `n - 3`
   - `l` is `st - 1`
   - For `r > l`, we need `n - 3 > st - 1`
   - Simplifying, `n - 3 > st - 1` becomes `n > st + 2`

2. **Condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**:
   - `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` must be equal
   - Given that `a[r - 1]` and `a[r - 2]` are equal, we need to ensure that `a[r]` is also equal to `a[r - 1]`
   - This means the next element in the list, `a[r]`, must be equal to `a[r - 1]`

Since `r` is `n - 3` and `l` is `st - 1`, the condition `r > l` simplifies to `n > st + 2`. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also be true, which is already given as part of the state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than `st + 2` and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st + 2`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the next two elements (i.e., `a[r - 1]` and `a[r - 2]`) are also equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is 3**
