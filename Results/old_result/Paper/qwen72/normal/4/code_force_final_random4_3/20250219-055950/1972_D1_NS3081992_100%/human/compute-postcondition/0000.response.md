The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0. Since the function `func_10()` is expected to return a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder**
