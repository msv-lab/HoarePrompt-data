Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` minus 2 times `a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`, `k` must be greater than 0, and the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`.**
