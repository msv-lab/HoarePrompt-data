### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is correct.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and returns it as a list of integers, which is also correct.
   - `func_3()` processes each test case, which is correct.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of the element `x` in the permutation `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - The binary search variables `low` and `high` are initialized correctly to `0` and `n-1` respectively.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 == high`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - The set `st` is used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search, but it is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm and can be removed for clarity.

5. **Binary Search Condition:**
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid] <= k`, then `low` is updated to `mid`.

6. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints `1` indicating one swap is needed, and then prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
- The binary search is performed correctly, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is not the standard use of binary search.
- The program assumes that if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x` after the binary search, a single swap will always suffice to place `x` at the correct position for the binary search to work.

### Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed to make the binary search work correctly.
- The problem statement guarantees that at most two swaps are sufficient, but the program only accounts for the possibility of needing one swap.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `6 3` and permutation `[1 2 3 4 5 6]`, the program correctly identifies that no swaps are needed.
- For the input `6 5` and permutation `[3 1 6 5 2 4]`, the program correctly identifies that one swap is needed.
- For the input `5 1` and permutation `[3 5 4 2 1]`, the program correctly identifies that one swap is needed.
- For the input `6 3` and permutation `[4 3 1 5 2 6]`, the program correctly identifies that one swap is needed.
- For the input `3 2` and permutation `[3 2 1]`, the program correctly identifies that one swap is needed.

However, consider a more complex permutation where two swaps are required:
- For the input `6 3` and permutation `[4 5 6 1 2 3]`, the program will only perform one swap, which is insufficient to make the binary search work correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it only handles the case where one swap is needed, but the problem statement guarantees that at most two swaps are sufficient. The program does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
