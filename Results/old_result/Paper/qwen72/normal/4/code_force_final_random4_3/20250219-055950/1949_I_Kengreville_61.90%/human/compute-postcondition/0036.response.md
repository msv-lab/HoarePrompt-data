The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain unchanged and are still initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for all their elements if `visited[0]` is `True`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, `visited[0]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0 and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1 and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` contains the index `0`, `j` is the last element in `nodes` (which is 0), `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is 1**
