Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign will occur.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: It iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.
4. **Calculate Next Year**: For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity that have occurred up to the current year.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- **Single Sign (n = 1)**: The program will correctly return the year `nums[0]` for a single sign.
- **Multiple Signs**: The program correctly calculates the year for each subsequent sign, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- **Large Periodicities**: The program can handle large periodicities up to \(10^6\) and multiple test cases up to 1000.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.
