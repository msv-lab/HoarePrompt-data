The value of `ans` is toggled using the XOR operation with 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after the operation `ans ^= 1`, `ans` becomes 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
