Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, `cx` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.**
