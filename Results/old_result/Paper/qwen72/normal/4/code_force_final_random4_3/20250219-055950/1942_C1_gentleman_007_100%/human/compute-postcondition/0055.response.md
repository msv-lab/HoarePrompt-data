The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function also implicitly uses two other parameters: `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `vis`, which is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited. The function returns a list of vertices that are adjacent to `ver` and have not been visited yet.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and returns a list of adjacent vertices that have not been visited yet.**
