The code snippet `s2 -= elements[-i]` updates the value of `s2` by subtracting the value of the last element in the `elements` list (since `i` is 1). The initial state specifies that `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`. After this operation, `s2` will be the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`.

Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`), `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` minus the last element in `elements`, `i` is 1**
