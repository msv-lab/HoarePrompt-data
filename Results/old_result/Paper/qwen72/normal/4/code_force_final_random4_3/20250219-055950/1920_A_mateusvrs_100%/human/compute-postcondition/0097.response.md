Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
