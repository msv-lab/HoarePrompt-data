Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where `k` is large enough to connect all vertices into a single clique. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is incorrect for large values of `k`. When `k` is large enough to connect all vertices, the number of cliques should be 1, but the program incorrectly calculates it as more than one.

Let's break down the program's behavior for the input `n = 8` and `k = 16`:

1. **Function Call and Initial Setup:**
   - `n = 8`, `k = 16`
   - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
   - `arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `cliquess = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2. **First Call to `make_array`:**
   - `left = 0`, `right = 7`, `clique = 1`
   - `small_element = 1`, `big_element = 8`
   - `mid = (8 - 1 + 1) // 2 = 4`
   - `not_mid = 8 - 0 + 1 - 4 = 4`
   - The first loop fills `arr` and `cliquess` as follows:
     - `arr[3] = 1`, `arr[2] = 2`, `arr[1] = 3`, `arr[0] = 4`
     - `cliquess[0] = 1`, `cliquess[1] = 1`, `cliquess[2] = 1`, `cliquess[3] = 1`
   - The second loop fills `arr` and `cliquess` as follows:
     - `arr[4] = 8`, `arr[5] = 7`, `arr[6] = 6`, `arr[7] = 5`
     - `cliquess[4] = 1`, `cliquess[5] = 1`, `cliquess[6] = 1`, `cliquess[7] = 1`

3. **Output:**
   - `arr = [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
   - `cliques = 1`
   - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

The output for `arr` is correct, but the output for `cliques` and `cliquess` is not. The program should output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
4 3 2 1 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This discrepancy is due to the incorrect handling of the `make_array` function, which does not ensure that the vertices are assigned to the correct cliques when `k` is large enough to connect all vertices.

Final: **False**
