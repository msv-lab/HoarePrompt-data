Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`, and `cur` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`, and `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`. `i` is `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` and `cur` remains 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `N`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, m_1, m_2). `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers read from input, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of the first `L[-1] - 2` integers modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 3. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` and `cur` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * (-3) % MOD` and `cur` remains 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
