Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `nums`. `a` is equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is equal to `k // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- `a` is assigned the value of `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2.
- `b` is assigned the value of `k // 2`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
