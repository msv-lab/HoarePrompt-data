Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, while the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `costs` remain unchanged. The list `costs` still contains the elements `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, with both `n` and `k` being within the range 1 to 10^18 and not equal to each other.
