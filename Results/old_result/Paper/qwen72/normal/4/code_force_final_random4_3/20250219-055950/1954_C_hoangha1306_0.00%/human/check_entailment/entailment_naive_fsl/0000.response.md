Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` in all cases. Specifically, the logic for swapping digits is flawed. The program only swaps digits if they are not equal, and it does so in a way that does not necessarily maximize the product. For example, consider the case where `x = 123` and `y = 321`. The correct output should be `x = 321` and `y = 123`, which maximizes the product. However, the program will output `x = 321` and `y = 123` only if the digits are already in the correct order. If the digits are not in the correct order, the program will not produce the correct result.

Example:
```
Input:
1
123
321

Output:
321
123
```

The program will output:
```
321
123
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
321
123
```

This example shows that the program does not always maximize the product of `x` and `y` as required by the problem description.
