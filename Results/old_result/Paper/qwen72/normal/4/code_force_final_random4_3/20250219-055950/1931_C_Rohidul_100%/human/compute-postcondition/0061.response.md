Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading to the `print(ans)` statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `le` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]` and `l` must be less than `r`.
   - `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r - 1]`.
   - `st` is `l + 1`.
   - `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`.
   - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

2. **Determine the value of `ans`:**
   - First, check if `a[0] == a[-1]`:
     - If true, all elements in `a` are equal. In this case, `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - 2)`.
     - If false, proceed to the next step.
   - If `a[0] != a[-1]`:
     - Find `l` (the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to `a[0]`).
     - Find `r` (the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r - 1]`).
     - Calculate `st` as `l + 1`.
     - Calculate `end` as the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`.
     - Finally, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

3. **Output:**
   - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, the output will be:
     - Output: **max(0, le - 2) (where le is the length of the list `a` and all elements in `a` are equal)**
   - If `a[0] != a[-1]`, the output will be:
     - Output: **le - max(st, end) (where le is the length of the list `a`, st is l + 1, and end is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`)**

Given the precondition, we can summarize the output as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as follows: if a[0] == a[-1], ans is max(0, le - 2); otherwise, ans is le - max(st, end), where le is the length of the list `a`, st is l + 1, and end is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `a[r]`)**
