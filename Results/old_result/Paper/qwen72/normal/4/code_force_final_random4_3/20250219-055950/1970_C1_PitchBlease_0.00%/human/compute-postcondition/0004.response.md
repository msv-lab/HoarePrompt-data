Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is equal to `target`.**
