The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; the number of test cases `t` is still given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
