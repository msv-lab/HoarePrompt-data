To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(k):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1.
- `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- If the bit at position 1 in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < k` must still hold true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `k` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. If the bit at position 1 in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
