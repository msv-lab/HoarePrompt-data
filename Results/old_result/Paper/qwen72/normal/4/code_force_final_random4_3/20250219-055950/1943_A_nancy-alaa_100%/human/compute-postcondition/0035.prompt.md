Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop or if statement that this `break` statement is inside is exited and `first` is set to True. Otherwise, `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not 1, and the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `i` still being 1 and all other variables retaining their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, and `first` is False. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
