Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1.**

The code snippet `ans = 1` reassigns the value of `ans` to 1, which was already the case according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
