Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.**

The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`. The other variables (`a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
