Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the user input, which is an integer greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `a` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which was input by the user during the loop execution.
- The variable `first_row` is a string that consists of the first character of each of the `n` user inputs, concatenated in the order they were entered.
- The variable `last_row` is a string that consists of the last character of each of the `n` user inputs, concatenated in the order they were entered.
