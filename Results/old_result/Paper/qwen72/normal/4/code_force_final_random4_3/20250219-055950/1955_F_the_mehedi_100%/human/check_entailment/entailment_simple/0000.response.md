### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - The sequence initially contains `p_1` ones, `p_2` twos, `p_3` threes, and `p_4` fours.
   - Eve can remove one number at a time, and the sequence is reduced by one number each time.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s (since 4 is 0 in XOR) in the sequence is even.
   - If the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd, the XOR will be non-zero, and Alice wins.
   - If the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is even, the XOR will be zero, and Bob wins.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s becomes even as many times as possible.
   - If the initial number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd, removing one of these numbers will make it even, and Bob wins.
   - If the initial number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is even, removing one of these numbers will make it odd, and Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, it increments `cnt` by 1. This is because removing one number from each of these counts will make the total count even, allowing Bob to win once.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`. This is because each pair of numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) can be removed without changing the parity of the total count, and each removal will allow Bob to win.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial condition where all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd.
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs of each number, which is a valid strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.
   - The program prints the correct result for each test case.
