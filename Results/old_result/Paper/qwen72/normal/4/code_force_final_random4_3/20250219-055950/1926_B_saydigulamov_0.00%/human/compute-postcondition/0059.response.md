Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each including an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The function returns the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the shape's size being greater than 1.**
