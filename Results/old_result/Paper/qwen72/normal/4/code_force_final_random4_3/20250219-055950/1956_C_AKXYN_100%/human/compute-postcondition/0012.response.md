To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will iterate from `n` down to 1 (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initially set to `n-1` before the loop starts, but the loop itself will set `i` to `n` on the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1
- `i` is n-1

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will set `i` to `n` on the first iteration, so we don't need to adjust `i` manually. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-1**
