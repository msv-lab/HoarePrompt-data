The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
