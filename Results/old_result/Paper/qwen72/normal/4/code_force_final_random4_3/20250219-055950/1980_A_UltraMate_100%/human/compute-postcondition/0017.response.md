Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, and `ans` is increased by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `s`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state remains the same: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`.
- The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG').
- For each character `i` in `p`, if `i` is not found in the string `s` (as recorded in the `hmp` Counter object), the variable `ans` is increased by `m`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will contain the total number of times `m` was added for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that was not present in `s`.
