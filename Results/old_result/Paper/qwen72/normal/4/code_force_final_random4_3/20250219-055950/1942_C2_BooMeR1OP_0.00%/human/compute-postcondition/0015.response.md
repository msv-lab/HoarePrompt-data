Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, if `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is `x - 1 + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + 1`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same except for the variable `ans`. If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, `ans` is now `x - 1 + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is now `x - 2 + 1`.
