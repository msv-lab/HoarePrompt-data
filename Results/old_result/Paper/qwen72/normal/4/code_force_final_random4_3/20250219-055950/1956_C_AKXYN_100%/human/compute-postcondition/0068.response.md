Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500). For each test case, it creates an `n x n` matrix where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates a result `res` as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. The function prints `res` followed by `n` shifted left by 1 bit (i.e., `n * 2`). Additionally, it prints a series of formatted strings for each integer from `n` down to 1, each string containing the integer and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value. **
