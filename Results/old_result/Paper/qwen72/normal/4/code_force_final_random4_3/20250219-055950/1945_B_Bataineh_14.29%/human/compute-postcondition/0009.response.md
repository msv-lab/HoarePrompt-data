Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, the current value of `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.**

The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new input integers. The conditions regarding `m` being less than `a` or `b`, or greater than or equal to both, are still valid based on the new input values. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
