Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
- The number of test cases `t` is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `1`**:
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `1`.

2. **Value of `i`**:
   - The second argument to the `print` function is the variable `i`, which is explicitly given as 3.

3. **Value of `*range(n, 0, -1)`**:
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, `*range(n, 0, -1)` will print the integers from `n` down to 1.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the integer `1`, followed by the integer `3`, and then the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **1, 3, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1** (where `n` is the input integer and the sequence is from `n` down to 1).
