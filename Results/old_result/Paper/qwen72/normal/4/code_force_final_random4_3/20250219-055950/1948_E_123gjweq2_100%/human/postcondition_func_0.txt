The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive) and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive). It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function then populates an array `arr` of length `n` such that each segment of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter) is filled with the corresponding `i + 1` value, where `i` ranges from 0 to `cliques - 1`. The function prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
