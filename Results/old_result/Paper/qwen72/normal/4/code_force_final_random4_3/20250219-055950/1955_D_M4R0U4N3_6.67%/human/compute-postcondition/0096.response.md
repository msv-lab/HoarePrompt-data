Output State: **`r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with all elements `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) removed if they were in `todo`. `done` is a set containing the integers `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) that were in `todo`. `extra` contains the integers `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) that were not in `todo`. `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is `m-1`.**
