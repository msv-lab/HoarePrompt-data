Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, where each element in `arr` is unique and within the range 1 to `n` after `func_2()` has been called, `pos` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, where each element in `arr` is unique and within the range 1 to `n` after `func_2()` has been called.
- The code snippet `pos = -1` assigns the value -1 to the variable `pos`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition that `pos` is now -1.
