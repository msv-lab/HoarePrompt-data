Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
   - The number of test cases `t` is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
   - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement will output the following:
     - The integer `2`.
     - The value of the variable `i`, which is 2.
     - The elements of the range `range(n, 0, -1)`, which generates a sequence of integers from `n` down to 1 in descending order.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The first two values printed are `2` and `2`.
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1. For example, if `n` is 5, the sequence will be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the integer `2`, followed by the integer `2`, followed by the sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **2, 2, n, n-1, ..., 2, 1 (where n is the input integer and the sequence is from n down to 1 in descending order)**
