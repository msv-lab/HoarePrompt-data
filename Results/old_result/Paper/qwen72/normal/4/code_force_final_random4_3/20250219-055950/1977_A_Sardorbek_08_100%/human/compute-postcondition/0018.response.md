Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`, `b` and `c` are updated to the new input values, and the parities of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. If `b` is equal to `c`, the program retains this state. Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, the program retains the state where `b` is not equal to `c`.**
