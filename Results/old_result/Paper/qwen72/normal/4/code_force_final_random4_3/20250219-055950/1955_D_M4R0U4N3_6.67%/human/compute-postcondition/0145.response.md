Output State: **`r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `done` and were not in `todo` initially, `done` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were in `todo` initially and any elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were added to `done` during the loop, `extra` contains the elements from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]` that were not in `todo` initially and were not added to `done` during the loop, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input.**
