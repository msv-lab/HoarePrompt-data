Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` is calculated as the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`. `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**
