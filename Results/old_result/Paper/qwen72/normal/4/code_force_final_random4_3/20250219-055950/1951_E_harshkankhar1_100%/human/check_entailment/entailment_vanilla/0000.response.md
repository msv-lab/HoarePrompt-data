### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be considered a valid partition with one part.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character `s[i]` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
     - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index `i`.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, making it impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome:
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic by construction.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks:
     - If `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot form a valid partition.
     - This is incorrect. The condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is not a valid criterion for determining if a partition is possible. For example, if `s = "abba"`, `x` would be 1, but the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings like "a" and "bba".
   - If the above conditions are not met, it prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is also incorrect. The partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` is not guaranteed to be non-palindromic. For example, if `s = "abba"`, `x` would be 1, and the partition would be "abb" and "a", which is not valid.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Specifically, the conditions `x == 1 or x == n // 2` and the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are not valid criteria for determining the correctness of the partition.
