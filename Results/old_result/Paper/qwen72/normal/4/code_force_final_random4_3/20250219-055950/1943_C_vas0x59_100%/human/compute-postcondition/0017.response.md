Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1999, inclusive; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and any previous values, and `u2vs[v]` contains `[u]` and any previous values, with `u` appended to `u2vs[v]`; `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2; `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so `v` is now the second integer provided by the user input minus 3.
- The values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
- The value of `u` remains the first integer provided by the user input minus 2.
