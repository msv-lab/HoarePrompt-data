Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. If `p3` >= `p1` + `p2` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` < `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is updated to `high + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop completes all iterations, the output is `p3`.***
