Reasoning:  
1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` and checks if it can be cyclically shifted to form a sorted list.
   - It creates a sorted version of the list `a` and concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - It then iterates through `concatenated_a` to find a subsequence of length `n` that matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - This approach is correct because if `a` can be cyclically shifted to form a sorted list, the sorted list must appear as a contiguous subsequence in `concatenated_a`.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the list `a`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(a)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by cyclic shifts.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's specifications.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
