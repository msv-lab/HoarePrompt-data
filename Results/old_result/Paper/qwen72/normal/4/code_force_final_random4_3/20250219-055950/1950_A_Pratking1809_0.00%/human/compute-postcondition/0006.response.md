Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mn` is 100. If `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` does not hold true.***
