Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the current values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and the current values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the current value of `k` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`. Otherwise, `k` is greater than `2 * n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
