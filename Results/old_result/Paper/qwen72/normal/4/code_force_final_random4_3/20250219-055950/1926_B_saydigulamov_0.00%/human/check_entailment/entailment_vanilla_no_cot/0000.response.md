Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The program does not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
2. The program only checks if the first two counts of '1's in the grid are equal, which is insufficient to determine the shape. A square has all rows with the same number of '1's, and a triangle has a specific pattern of increasing or decreasing counts of '1's.
3. The program does not handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle.
4. The program does not check the positioning of '1's to ensure they form a valid shape (e.g., the '1's in a triangle should be centered, and in a square, they should be aligned).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Count the number of '1's in each row.
- Check if these counts form a square or a triangle pattern.
- Ensure the '1's are positioned correctly for the shape.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(k, n):
    # Check if k forms a triangle pattern
    for i in range(len(k)):
        if k[i] != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_upside_down_triangle(k, n):
    # Check if k forms an upside-down triangle pattern
    for i in range(len(k)):
        if k[i] != 2 * (n - i) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(k):
    # Check if k forms a square pattern
    return all(x == k[0] for x in k)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        k = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
        
        # Check if the shape is a square
        if is_square(k):
            print("SQUARE")
        # Check if the shape is a triangle
        elif is_triangle(k, len(k)) or is_upside_down_triangle(k, len(k)):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This should not happen as per the problem constraints

func()
```

This corrected version checks for both triangle and square patterns and ensures the correct output format.
