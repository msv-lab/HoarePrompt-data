Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is the integer value of `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 2), and `q` is the integer value of `l[p - 1]`. If `q` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
