Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx` for all `a` values not equal to 1 or 2. If `bx` > `ax`, a new element 0 is appended to the list `r`. If `bx` <= `ax`, `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.***
