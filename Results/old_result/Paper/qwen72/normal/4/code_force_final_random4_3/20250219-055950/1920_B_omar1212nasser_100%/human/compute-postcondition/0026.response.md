Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function calculates a series of values, each representing the sum of all integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` integers, minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` integers, adjusted for the removal of the last `removals` integers. It returns the maximum value from this series. The final state of the program includes the original `elements` list, the unchanged `removals` and `negatives` parameters, and the calculated maximum value. **
