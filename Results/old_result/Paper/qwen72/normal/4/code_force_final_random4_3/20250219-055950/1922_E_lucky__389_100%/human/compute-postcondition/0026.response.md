To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition `2 ** i <= x`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

- `i` is 0.
- `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1.

Given that `i` is 0, `2 ** i` will always be 1. For the loop to execute, `1 <= x` must be true. Since `x` is already defined as a positive integer and at least 1, the condition `1 <= x` is always satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer not equal to 0, not equal to 2, and at least 1. `i` is 0.**
