You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement, which includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and an n × m grid represented by a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''

            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are integers input by the user for the last test case, and `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings for the last test case. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` for the last test case, and `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` for the last test case. The loop has processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has checked the conditions and printed 'NO' if either the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row, or if the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column. Otherwise, it has printed 'YES' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n × m` grid represented by a list of strings containing 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last row.
2. If the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character and is not equal to the last column.
If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the grid meets the specified conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns to determine if the grid can be made uniform. This approach fails in cases where the grid can be made uniform but does not meet the specific conditions checked by the program.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```
The program will output "NO" because the first and last rows are not the same, and the first and last columns are not the same. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
