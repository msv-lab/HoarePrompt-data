Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]` and `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 2, `st` is 4, `end` is 1.**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
