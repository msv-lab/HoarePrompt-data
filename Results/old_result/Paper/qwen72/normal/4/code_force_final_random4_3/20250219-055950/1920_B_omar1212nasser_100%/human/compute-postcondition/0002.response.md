Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `pos`.
- The new element is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `elements[-negatives:]` is a slice of the list `elements` that includes the last `negatives` elements.
- `sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of these last `negatives` elements.
- `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` computes the new value to be appended to `pos`.
- The values of `elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- `pos` is now a list with one element, which is the result of the calculation `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
