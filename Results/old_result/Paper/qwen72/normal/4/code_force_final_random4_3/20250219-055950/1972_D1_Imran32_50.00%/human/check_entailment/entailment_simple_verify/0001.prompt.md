You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 × 10^6.

    #State: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `root + 1`, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `cnt` is `root * root`, `ans` is increased by the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `root`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(\text{root}\), and \(\text{root}\) is the integer part of the square root of \(n\) plus 1)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in the range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem.
   - The variable `k` is read but not used, which suggests a potential misunderstanding or error in the function.
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to be related to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation \((n + i) // cnt\) does not correspond to any known method for solving the given problem.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done using a nested loop, but given the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed.
   - One efficient approach is to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the fact that \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified to checking if \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The logic inside the function `func_1()` is incorrect and does not match the problem requirements.
