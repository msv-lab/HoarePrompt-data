Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the given range and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not used in the loop.
- The variable `s` remains the input string.
- The variable `cnt` is incremented each time the loop sets all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, and `cur` is reset to 0.
- The variable `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`. Each character in `s` is converted to its corresponding bit position (0 to `k-1`), and if that bit is not already set in `cur`, it is set. If `cur` ever equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all bits from 0 to `k-1` are set, and `cur` is reset to 0, and `cnt` is incremented.
