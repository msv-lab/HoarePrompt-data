Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `func_1` does not take any input parameters, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, the first element is a list `[num1, num2]` and the second element is also a list `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the integers from the first line of input, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
