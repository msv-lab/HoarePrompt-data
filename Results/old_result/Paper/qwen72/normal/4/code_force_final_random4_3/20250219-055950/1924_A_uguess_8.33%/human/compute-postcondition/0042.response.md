Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. If the bit at position 1 in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.***
