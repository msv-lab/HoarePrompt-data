### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and initializes a matrix `mat` with `n` rows, each containing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `res` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` calculates the sum of the matrix elements using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the elements in a fully populated matrix (where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`) can be calculated as the sum of the first `n` natural numbers multiplied by `n` (since each number appears `n` times in the matrix).

3. **Output the Result and Operations:**
   - The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is `2n`).
   - It then prints `2n` operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations:
     - Type 1 operation: `1 %d` % i, *range(1, n + 1)`, which assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the i-th row.
     - Type 2 operation: `2 %d` % i, *range(1, n + 1)`, which assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the i-th column.

4. **Correctness of the Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation is correct. The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum of the matrix elements, which is indeed the maximum possible sum for a matrix of size `n x n` where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Correctness of the Operations:**
   - The operations are correct and ensure that the matrix is fully populated with the maximum possible values.
   - By performing `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations, the matrix will have each row and each column filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

6. **Number of Operations:**
   - The number of operations `2n` is within the allowed limit of `2n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The operations are within the allowed limit and ensure that the matrix is fully populated with the maximum possible values.

### Correctness:
**True**
