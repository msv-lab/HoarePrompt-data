The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then determines if the `f`-th element in `a` (considering 1-based indexing) is among the top `k` largest elements in `a` when sorted in descending order. If all occurrences of this element are within the top `k` largest elements, it prints 'YES'. If none of the occurrences are within the top `k` largest elements, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
