You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, each set consisting of an integer `slength` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `slength`. For each set, it checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `tests`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the state of the last iteration, and the number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs will match the number of test cases `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not is flawed. The program checks if any character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`, but this is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will output `YES` because it finds that the character 'g' in `c` is not in `a` or `b`. However, there is no valid template that can make both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not. For example, if the template were "ABC", `a` and `b` would not match because their characters are all lowercase and different from the uppercase template characters. If the template were "abc", `c` would match, which is not allowed.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle this case and is therefore incorrect.
