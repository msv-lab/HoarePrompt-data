Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `y` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.***
