Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it performs a series of calculations involving the elements of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It then compares two cumulative values `bm` and `sm` and prints 'Bodya' if `bm` is greater, 'Sasha' if `bm` is less, and 'Draw' if they are equal. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with the state of `i` being `t - 1`, `n` unchanged, and `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` modified as described in the annotations. **
