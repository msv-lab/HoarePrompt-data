The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` updates the value of `cnt` based on whether the characters at the index `i` in the strings `s` and `t` are different. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters are different, and remains unchanged if they are the same. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is different from `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.**
