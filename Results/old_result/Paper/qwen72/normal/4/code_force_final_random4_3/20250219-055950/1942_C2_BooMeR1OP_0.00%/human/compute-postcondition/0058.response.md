Postcondition: ***`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen and must be greater than 1, `present` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `gaps`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`. If `y` >= `pairs`, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, and `y` is decreased by the value of `pairs`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
