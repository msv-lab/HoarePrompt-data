### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing them.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer.
   - This is because the minimum of any pair will always be the smaller of the two numbers, and by pairing the smallest numbers first, we ensure that we are adding the largest possible minimum values to our score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Sort the array of integers.
   - The sorted array will have the smallest numbers at the beginning.
   - By summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest elements), we can achieve the maximum score.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A`.
   - It prints the sum of every second element starting from the first, which is `sum(A[::2])`.
   - The loop `while t` ensures that the program processes all test cases.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - The program correctly sums every second element starting from the first, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum final score for each test case as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
