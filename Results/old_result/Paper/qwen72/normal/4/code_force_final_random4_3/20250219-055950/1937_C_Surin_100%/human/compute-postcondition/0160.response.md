Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.**

The code `r = input('')` updates the value of `r` to a new input string. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `v1` will be determined based on the new value of `r` being `<` or not.
