Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string, and `j` is the last index of `b` (i.e., `len(b) - 1`).** 

The code snippet `d = int(input())` only affects the variable `d`, which is now assigned the value of the input integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
