Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle all the potential cases based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
   \]
   This formula is derived from the constraints and the scoring system:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The maximum number of draws is the total points divided by 2, minus the points that must be won by the highest scorer to maintain the score difference.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All scores are zero**: The program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **One draw**: The program correctly handles cases where only one draw occurred.
   - **No valid set of games**: The program correctly prints `-1` when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
   - **Maximum draws**: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for valid scores.

After reviewing the program and considering various edge cases and potential inputs, I cannot find any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
