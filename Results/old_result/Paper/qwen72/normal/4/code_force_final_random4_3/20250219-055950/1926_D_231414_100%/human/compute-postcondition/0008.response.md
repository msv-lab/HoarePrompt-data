The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `data`. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `data` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `times` must be greater than 0 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `_` is 0 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `data` is a list of integers provided by the user (must have at least one integer for the loop to execute)
- `dic` is an empty dictionary (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `ans` is 0 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `check` is 2147483647 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first integer in `data`**
