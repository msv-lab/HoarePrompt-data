The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This operation updates the value of `b` and does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
