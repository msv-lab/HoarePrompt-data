Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, and `dp[1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is unchanged for `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, and `m`.
- The list `dp` is still of length `m + 1`, and each element is initially 0.
- The code snippet `dp[1] = 1` sets the second element of the list `dp` to 1. Therefore, `dp[1]` is now 1.
