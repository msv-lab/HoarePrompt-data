Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, but `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**
