#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be `def func(n, m, k):` where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is the total number of iterations, `itest` is `t-1`, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Yes' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
