Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer. If `no` is True, it indicates that all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b`. If `no` is False, it indicates that `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or at least one character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`.***
