Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is now `ans` plus the negative of the first element in `item`. If `item[2]` is 1, `tp1` is 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
