The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop body. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
