You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        same = 1

        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

    #State: _ is t-1, n is an input integer, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is equal to the length of ar, and minn is the minimum value of consecutive identical elements in ar. If minn is `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then minn is -1. Otherwise, minn is the smallest number of consecutive identical elements found in any of the arrays processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It determines the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `a` for each test case. If the list `a` is entirely composed of the same element or if no such consecutive identical elements are found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a "beautiful" array, which means we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer "beautiful". If it's impossible, output `-1`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If it finds a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `same` count and the previous `minn`.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the final `same` count.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** If all elements are the same, the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array and prints `-1`.
   - **Single element array:** If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing it would make the array empty, which is not beautiful. The program correctly handles this by checking if `minn` is `inf` and prints `-1`.
   - **Mixed elements:** The program correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful. However, the problem statement guarantees that the array is always beautiful, so this is not a concern.
   - The program correctly updates `minn` and handles the edge cases as described.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and problem description. It handles all the edge cases and the logic is sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
