Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is a list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `space_x` is equal to the new `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to the new `x + y * 4`, `n` is `n - 1`, `screen_require_for_y` remains the same, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If the new `space_x` <= `remaining_cells`, `result` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to the new `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, and if the new `space_x` % 15 == 0, `extra_screen` is equal to the new `x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `(new x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`. The value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` has been appended to the list `result`.**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` are updated with new integer values from the input.
- `space_x` is recalculated as the new `x`.
- `space_y` is recalculated as the new `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is recalculated as the new `x + y * 4`.
- `n` is decremented by 1.
- `screen_require_for_y` remains unchanged.
- `remaining_cells` is recalculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- The conditions for updating `result` are checked with the new values of `space_x` and `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` and `extra_screen` are calculated and the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`.
