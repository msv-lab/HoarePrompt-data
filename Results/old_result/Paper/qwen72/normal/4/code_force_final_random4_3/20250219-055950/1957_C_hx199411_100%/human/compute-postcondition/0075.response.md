To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m + 1` is greater than 3, which means `m` must be at least 3. Given that `m` is defined as `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to start.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 3, so no adjustment is needed for `i` itself.
2. **`m`**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3. This means `n - num` must be at least 3.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3
- `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `m` is at least 3. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `num` is the total number of increments based on the conditions of the loop, which is the sum of 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r` for all `k` iterations.**
