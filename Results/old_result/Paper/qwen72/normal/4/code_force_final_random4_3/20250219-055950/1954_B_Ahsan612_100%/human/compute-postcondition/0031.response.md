Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` if `i` is 3, otherwise `num` is `ar[3]` or `ar[4]`, `len(ar)` is greater than 4. If `ar[i]` == `num`, `same` is 3 or 4 if `ar[i-1]` == `num`, and `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` != `num`. If `ar[i]` != `num`, `same` is 1 and `i` is 4 or 5.**
