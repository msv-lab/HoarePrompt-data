Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the user's input, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

Explanation:
- `cost` is assigned the value of `mu * w`.
- `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the first `q` elements of `M`.
- All other variables (`L`, `t`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
