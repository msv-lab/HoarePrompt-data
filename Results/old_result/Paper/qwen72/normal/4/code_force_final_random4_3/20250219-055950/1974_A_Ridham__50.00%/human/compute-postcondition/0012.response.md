Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, if `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, if `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on the value of `y`:
  - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
  - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- All other variables (`n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `total_space`) remain unchanged.
