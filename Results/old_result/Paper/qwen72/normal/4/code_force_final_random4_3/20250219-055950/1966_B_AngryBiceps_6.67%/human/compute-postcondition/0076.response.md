Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, with `n` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, meaning all the first characters in the strings in `a` are the same.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
