### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Breaking Down the Solution:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we need `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need to ensure that the total number of people in these tents is a multiple of 3. If `b` (the number of extroverts) is not a multiple of 3, we need to use universals to make up the difference.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill in the gaps left by extroverts. If `b % 3` is not zero, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - If `b % 3 == 0` or there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `a`.
   - If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns `-1` if `b % 3 != 0` and `b // 3` otherwise.
   - If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the function correctly returns `ceil(c / 3)`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For a combination of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the function correctly checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and returns the minimum number of tents needed.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the number of extroverts can be accommodated in tents of 3 people each, using universals to fill any remaining spots if necessary.
   - The function `func_2` then adds the number of tents required for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly checks if `b % 3 != 0` and if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
  - If `b % 3 == 0` or there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`, which is the correct number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `b % 3 != 0` and there are not enough universals, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly handles the result from `func_1`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the result from `func_1`.

### Verification with Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
  - Actual Output: `3`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4 1`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 extrovert left without enough universals to form a tent.
  - Actual Output: `-1`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
  - Actual Output: `3`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 extrovert left without enough people to form a tent.
  - Actual Output: `-1`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 3 2`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals.
  - Actual Output: `3`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `19 7 18`
  - Expected Output: `28`
  - Reason: 19 tents for the introverts, 7 extroverts need 2 more people to form 3 tents, and 18 universals can fill these spots and form additional tents.
  - Actual Output: `28`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Reason: No participants, no tents needed.
  - Actual Output: `0`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `7 0 0`
  - Expected Output: `7`
  - Reason: 7 introverts, each needing a separate tent.
  - Actual Output: `7`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `0 24 0`
  - Expected Output: `8`
  - Reason: 24 extroverts, forming 8 tents of 3 people each.
  - Actual Output: `8`
  - Result: Correct

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`

  - Reason: 1000000000 introverts, 1000000000 extroverts, and 1000000000 universals. The extroverts can form 333333333 tents, and the remaining universals can form 333333334 tents.
  - Actual Output: `1666666667`
  - Result: Correct

### Conclusion:
