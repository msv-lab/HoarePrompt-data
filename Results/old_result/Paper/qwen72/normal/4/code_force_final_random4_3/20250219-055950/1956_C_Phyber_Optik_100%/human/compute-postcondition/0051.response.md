Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 35, `i` is 4, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 4, `t` is `t` - 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated to `sum` + ((`i` * `i`) - ((`i` - 1) * (`i` - 1))) * `i`.
- With `i` being 4, the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` evaluates to `(16 - 9) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`.
- Therefore, `sum` is updated from 19 to 19 + 28 = 35.
- The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but it is still required to be greater than 0.
