The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `b` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the previous value of `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
