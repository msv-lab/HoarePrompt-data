The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of the string `b`, and `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
