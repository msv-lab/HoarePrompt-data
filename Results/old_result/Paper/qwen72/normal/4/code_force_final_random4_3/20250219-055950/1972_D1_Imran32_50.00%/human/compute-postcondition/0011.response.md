The code snippet `ans += (n + i) // cnt` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division result of `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 4
- `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2
- `cnt` is 16
- `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. `n + i` is `n + 4`
2. `(n + 4) // 16` is the integer division of `n + 4` by 16
3. `ans` is incremented by this result

Since `n` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n + 4` is 5. The integer division of 5 by 16 is 0. For larger values of `n`, the result will depend on the specific value of `n`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + (n + 4) // 16`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 4, `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 16, `ans` is increased by `(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`**
