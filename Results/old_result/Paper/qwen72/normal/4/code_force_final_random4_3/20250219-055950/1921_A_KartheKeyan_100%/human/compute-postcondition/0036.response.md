Output State: **`i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**
