The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct

The code snippet does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. It only introduces a new list `l` which is populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
