### Reasoning:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction:**
   - The program aims to construct the lexicographically smallest string by choosing the optimal path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
   - The variable `work` is used to determine whether the grasshopper should move right or down. Initially, it is set to `True`, meaning the grasshopper starts by moving right.
   - The loop iterates through the grid, and at each step, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans` if `work` is `True`.
   - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, the grasshopper switches to moving down (`work = False`).
   - If the end of the grid is reached, the last character from `b` is appended to `ans`.
   - This logic ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is constructed by always choosing the smallest available character.

2. **Counting Paths:**
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest string, the program counts the number of paths that yield this string.
   - The `counter` is initialized to 1, representing the initial path.
   - The loop iterates through the grid, checking if the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`. If they match, the counter is incremented.
   - If a '0' in `a` is followed by a '1' in `b`, the counter is reset to 1.
   - The loop breaks if any character in `a` does not match the corresponding character in `b` and is not a '0' followed by a '1'.
   - This logic correctly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by considering the matching characters and the reset condition.

3. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - For each test case, it prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.
   - The input and output handling is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly, as shown in the example.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is larger and the characters in `a` and `b` are mixed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
