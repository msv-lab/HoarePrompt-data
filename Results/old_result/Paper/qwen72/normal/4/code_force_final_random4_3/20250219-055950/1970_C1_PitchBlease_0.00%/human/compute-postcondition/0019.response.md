Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `tree[start]` must have at least one more neighbor. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set, and the tuple `(neighbor, 1)` is appended to the `queue`. Otherwise, `neighbor` remains in the `visited` set and the `queue` is unchanged.***
