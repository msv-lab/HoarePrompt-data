### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.
   - This is because if `n > k`, Bob cannot repaint all parts, and if `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1: `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`**
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 2: `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`**
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < k`, so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 3: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`**
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= k`, so the output is 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 4: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`**
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 < k`, so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 5: `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`**
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= k`, so the output is 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions checked in the program are consistent with the problem requirements and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
