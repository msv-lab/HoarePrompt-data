Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `vt` is 1, and the first characters of `a` and `b` are different. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
