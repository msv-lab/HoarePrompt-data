Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`, `idx` is now `4 + 3*n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers converted from the strings in `data` starting from index `4 + 2*n` and ending at `4 + 2*n + n - 1`, `results` contains the value returned by `func_1(a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, so `idx` is now `4 + 2*n + n`, which simplifies to `4 + 3*n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
