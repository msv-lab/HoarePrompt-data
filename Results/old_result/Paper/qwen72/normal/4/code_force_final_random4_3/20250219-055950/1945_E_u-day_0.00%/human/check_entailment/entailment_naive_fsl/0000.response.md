Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs to be executed after more than one swap to correctly find the position of `x`. According to the problem description, the binary search should be performed after rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps, and the output should specify the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

However, the program only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find `x` in the initial permutation. This means that for cases where more than one swap is required to make the binary search work correctly, the program will fail to produce the correct output.

**Example of Failure:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

However, the program will output:
```
1
2 2
```

This is incorrect because the program only performs one swap, and the binary search still does not find `x` in the correct position. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
