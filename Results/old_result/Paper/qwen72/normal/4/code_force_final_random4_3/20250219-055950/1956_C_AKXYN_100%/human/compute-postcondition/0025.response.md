Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 0, `i` is 0.**

The code snippet `res = 0` resets the value of `res` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `res` while keeping the other variables and their constraints the same.
