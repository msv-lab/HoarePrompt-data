Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q` (the number of elements in the array and the number of queries).
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a list `x` with a single element `0` to store the cumulative XOR values.
   - It also initializes a `defaultdict` `inds` to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative XOR values for the array `a` and appends them to the list `x`.
   - It also updates the `inds` dictionary to keep track of the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It checks if the cumulative XOR value at `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR value at `r`. If they are equal, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR value.
   - If the cumulative XOR values are not equal, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the smallest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a valid split point where the subarray can be divided into parts with the same XOR value.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Binary Search Functions**:
   - `func_2` and `func_4` are used to perform binary search on the indices stored in `inds`.
   - `func_2` finds the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is true.
   - `func_4` finds the smallest index `r` such that `predicate(arr[r])` is false and returns `r + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by checking the cumulative XOR values and using the `inds` dictionary to find valid split points.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of cumulative XOR values and binary search ensures that the program can efficiently handle the constraints (up to 2 * 10^5 elements and queries).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently checks if a subarray is interesting by leveraging cumulative XOR values and binary search.

Correctness: **True**
