Let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `curr` is `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
   - `h` is `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
   - `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `curr` is simply `n`.
   - `h` is updated by adding the integer division of `n` by `n - k + 1` and the integer division of the remainder of `n % (n - k + 1)` by 1.
   - `n` is updated to the remainder of `n % (n - k + 1) % 1`.

3. **Simplifying the Expressions:**
   - `n % (n - k + 1) % 1` will always result in 0 because any integer modulo 1 is 0.
   - Therefore, `n` becomes 0 after the update.
   - `h` is updated to `h + (n // (n - k + 1)) + (n % (n - k + 1) // 1)`.
     - Since `n` is 0, `n // (n - k + 1)` is 0.
     - `n % (n - k + 1)` is also 0, and `0 // 1` is 0.
     - So, `h` becomes `h + 0 + 0`, which means `h` remains unchanged.

4. **Final State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2)`.
   - This statement will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `i`, `costs`, `curr`, `h`, and `n`.

Output: **2**
