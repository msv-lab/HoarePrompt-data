Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of the current value of `minn` and the value of `same`.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `len(ar)`) are not affected by this code.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with the addition that `minn` is now the minimum value between its previous value and `same`.
