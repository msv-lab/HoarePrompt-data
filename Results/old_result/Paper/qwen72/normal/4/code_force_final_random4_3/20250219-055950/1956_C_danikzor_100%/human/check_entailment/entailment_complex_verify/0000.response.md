Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The formula used in the program to calculate the maximum sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is indeed incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Correct Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - Each row and each column of the matrix can be filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Program's Formula**:
   - The program uses the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` to calculate the sum.
   - This formula is derived from a different context and does not match the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Correct maximum sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 6 \).
     - Program's output: \( 2 * (2 + 1) * (4 * 2 - 1) // 6 = 7 \).
     - This discrepancy confirms that the program's formula is incorrect.

4. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation assigns a descending permutation of integers from \( n \) to 1 to either a row or a column.
   - While the operations are valid, they do not achieve the correct maximum sum due to the incorrect formula.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
