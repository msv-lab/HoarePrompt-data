Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi` and has been reduced by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is 0 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `a[l]` was 0, `l` is 2 and `ans` is `ans + 2`. Otherwise, `l` remains 1 and `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
