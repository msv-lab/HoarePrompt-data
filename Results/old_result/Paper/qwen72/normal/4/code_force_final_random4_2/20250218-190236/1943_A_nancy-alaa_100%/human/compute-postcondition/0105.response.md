Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2, `first` is True.** 

The variable `first` is set to `True`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` being `True` will be evaluated later, but for now, the only change is the assignment of `first` to `True`.
