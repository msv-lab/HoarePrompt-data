Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the closest city calculation. Specifically, it should return a list where each element represents the minimum cost to travel to the closest city, not the absolute difference between the next or previous city.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the distance to the previous city otherwise. This is incorrect because it should always set `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the closest city is the next one, and to 1 if the closest city is the previous one, regardless of the actual distance.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the results of `func_1`.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, the prefix sum arrays will also be incorrect.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program uses the prefix sum arrays to determine the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array.
   - Due to the incorrect prefix sum arrays, the query processing will yield incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases by using extreme values for `back` and `forward` in `func_1`, but this is not sufficient to ensure correctness because the logic within `func_1` is flawed.

6. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The logic for determining the closest city and calculating the prefix sums is not consistent with the problem description. The problem requires that the closest city is unique and the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin, but the current implementation does not reflect this.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program's efficiency is not affected by the logical error, but the incorrect logic means that the results are not valid.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum number of coins for each query, but these values are incorrect due to the flawed `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the cost to travel to the closest city, and this error propagates to the prefix sum calculations and query processing.

Final: **False**
