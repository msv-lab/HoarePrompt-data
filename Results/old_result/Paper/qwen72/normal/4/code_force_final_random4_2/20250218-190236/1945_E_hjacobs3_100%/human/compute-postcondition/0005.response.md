Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is (0 + n) // 2, `r` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, and the element at the `mid` index of `array` is less than or equal to `find`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid`, which is `(0 + n) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The element at the `mid` index of `array` is still less than or equal to `find`.
