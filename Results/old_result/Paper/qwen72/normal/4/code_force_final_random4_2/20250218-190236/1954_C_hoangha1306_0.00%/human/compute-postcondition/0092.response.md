Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 0, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the second character of `b` if the second character of `a` is less than or equal to the second character of `b`; otherwise, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `b` and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a`.**

- `i` remains 1.
- `a` and `b` are still input strings with their respective lengths.
- `t` is still an input integer within the specified range.
- `q` remains 1.
- `vt` remains 0.
- `x` and `y` are updated to the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b` respectively, with `x` being the smaller value and `y` being the larger value.
