The given code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `c` is an input string that must contain at least one character.
- `no` is True.
- `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
- `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides several conditions and variable values, but none of these conditions or values are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
