Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`, `cost` is not yet updated, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**

Explanation:
- The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`.
- The variable `N` now contains one fewer element, specifically the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
- The variable `n` is updated to reflect the new number of elements in `N`, which is `q-1`.
- The variable `w` is assigned the value of the last element that was removed from `N`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `cost`) remain unchanged.
