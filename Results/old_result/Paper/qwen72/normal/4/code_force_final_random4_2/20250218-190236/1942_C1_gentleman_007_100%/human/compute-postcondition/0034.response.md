Output State: **`q` has the same number of elements as before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes, `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]` and is now appended to `q`, `vis[node]` is 1.**

The code snippet sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the `node` has been visited. The other conditions remain unchanged: `q` still has the same number of elements, `ver` is still the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` still contains at least three nodes, and `node` is still the third node in `graph[ver]` and has been appended to `q`.
