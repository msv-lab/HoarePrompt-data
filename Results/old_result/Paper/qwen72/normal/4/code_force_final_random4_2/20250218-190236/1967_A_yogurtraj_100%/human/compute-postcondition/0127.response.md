Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 2 (not used in the print statement).
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `k` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
   - `y` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `r` is the value of `a[n-1]`, which is the element at index `n-1` in the sorted list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - The expression inside the print statement is:
     \[
     (r - 1) \times n + 1 + rem + y
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     (a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     (a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1
     \]

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression \((a[n-1] - 1) \times n + 1\).

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n-1] is the element at index n-1 in the sorted list a)**
