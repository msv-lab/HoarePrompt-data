Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept a single integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and return a string of uppercase Latin letters of length at most 200 with exactly `n` special characters, or "NO" if no such string exists. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        pattern = []
        for i in range(n // 2):
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
        print(''.join(pattern))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list that contains the characters `'A'` and `'B'` repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'B' if `n` is even and starting with 'A' if `n` is odd, with the total length of the list being `n`. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is a list that contains the characters 'A' and 'B' repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
