Postcondition: **`n` is the initial value of `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks and the final state is determined at that point. Additionally, `bm` is greater than `sm`.**
