Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem by calculating the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents required.

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
