Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by adding the first element of `arr` (which is `num`) as a key and setting its value to 1 if it is not already in the dictionary, or incrementing its value by 1 if it is already present.
- Since `frequency_table` was initially empty, `num` is added as a key with a value of 1.
- The states of `arr`, `num`, and `k` remain unchanged.
