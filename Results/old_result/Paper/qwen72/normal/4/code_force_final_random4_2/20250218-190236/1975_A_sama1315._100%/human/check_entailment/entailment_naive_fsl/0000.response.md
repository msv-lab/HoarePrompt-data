Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program provided seems to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if the array can become non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - It creates a concatenated array `a + a` to handle the circular nature of the problem.
   - It then iterates through the concatenated array to find a subarray of length `n` that matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Test Case**: The program correctly handles a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each one.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a valid subarray of the concatenated array.
- **Unsortable Array**: If the array cannot be sorted by any number of prefix-suffix swaps, the program will return "No".
- **Edge Case with Repeated Elements**: The program correctly handles arrays with repeated elements.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6\n1 1 4 5 1 4`
  - Output: "No"
  - Explanation: No prefix-suffix swap can make the array non-decreasing.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n7 9 2 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array can be sorted by the operations described in the problem.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
  - Output: "Yes"
  - Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no operation is needed.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases or logical errors, the program is considered correct.
