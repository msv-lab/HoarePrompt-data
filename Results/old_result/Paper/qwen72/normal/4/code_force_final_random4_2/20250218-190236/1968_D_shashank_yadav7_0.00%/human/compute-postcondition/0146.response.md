To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bodya')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the first input integer.
2. `i` is `n - 1`.
3. `k` is the second input integer minus `n`.
4. `b` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations.
5. `s` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[s] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations.
6. `bm` is the initial value of `a[b] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
7. `sm` is the initial value of `a[s] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
8. `sp` is the initial value of `a[s]` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
9. `bp` is the initial value of `a[b]` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
10. `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state describes complex operations and variables, but none of these variables or operations are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
