Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains `n - 3`.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `el` remains the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`.
- `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`.
- `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`.
- `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`.
