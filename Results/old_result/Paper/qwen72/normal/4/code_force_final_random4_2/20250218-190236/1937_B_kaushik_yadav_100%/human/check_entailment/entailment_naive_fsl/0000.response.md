Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by choosing a different path. Specifically, the logic for determining when to switch from following the top row to the bottom row is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1001
0010
```

The expected output should be:
```
00001
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
10001
1
```

This is because the program incorrectly decides to stay on the top row until it reaches a point where it can switch to the bottom row, leading to a suboptimal and incorrect lexicographically smallest string. The correct approach should be to always choose the path that yields the smallest possible string at each step, which in this case would involve switching to the bottom row as soon as it becomes lexicographically smaller.
