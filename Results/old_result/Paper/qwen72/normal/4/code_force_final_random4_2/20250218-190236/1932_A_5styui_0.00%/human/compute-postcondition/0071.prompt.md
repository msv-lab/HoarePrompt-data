Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least one character, `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0, and if the first character of `b` is '*', and `b` has a second character which is also '*', or if `b` is non-empty, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is 1. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '*', and the second character is also '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and the second character is not '*', or if the first character of `b` at index `j` is not '*', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is not '@' and not '*', then `s` is 0 and the program continues as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `j` is 2. If the character at index 2 in `b` is '@', `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the character at index 2 in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
