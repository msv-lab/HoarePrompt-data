To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `r` is set to `n`.
   - `old` is set to `a[n - m]`, where `a` is an input list of integers.
   - `done` is a set that contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `done` during the loop execution.
   - `todo` is a set that contains integers from the input list `a` that were not in the initial `m` elements and were not added to `done` during the loop execution.
   - `extra` is a set that contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`.
   - `ans` is increased by the number of times the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans` is a counter that increments each time the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `done` is a set that tracks elements that have been processed.
   - `todo` is a set that tracks elements that have not been processed yet.
   - `extra` is a set that tracks elements that were in the initial `m` elements or were added during the loop but were not added to `done`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop likely iterates over the elements of the list `a` starting from index `n - m` and processes them.
   - During each iteration, elements are added to `done` or `todo` based on certain conditions.
   - The length of `done` is checked against `k` to determine if `ans` should be incremented.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans`, which is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the length of done was greater than or equal to k during the loop execution)**
