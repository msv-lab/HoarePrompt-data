Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k` and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0, `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the update, `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
- The initial value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- After the update, `ans1` becomes the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
