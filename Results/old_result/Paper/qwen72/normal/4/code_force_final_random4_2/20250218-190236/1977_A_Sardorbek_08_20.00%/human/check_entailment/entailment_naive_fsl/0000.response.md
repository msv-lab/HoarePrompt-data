Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when `n` is greater than `m` and both `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program should output "Yes" because it is possible to build a tower of 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., put 3 cubes, remove 1 cube, put 1 cube). However, the program incorrectly outputs "No" in this case. The issue lies in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` where `a` is the number of test cases and should be `c` instead. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.
