Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and 10^9. The function calculates the minimum value of the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` and the suffix sums of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. It prints this minimum value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`. The input parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not modified. **
