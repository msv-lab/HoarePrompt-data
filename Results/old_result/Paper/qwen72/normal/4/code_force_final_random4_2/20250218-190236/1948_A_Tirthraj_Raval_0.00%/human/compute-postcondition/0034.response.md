Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `pattern` is a list that contains the characters `'A'` and `'B'` repeated in an alternating pattern, with a total of `n` characters.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n // 2` iterations.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n // 2 - 1`, which is the last index of the range.
- The `pattern` list will contain `n` characters, alternating between `'A'` and `'B'`. For each iteration, two characters are added to the list, one `'A'` and one `'B'`, in that order. Therefore, the final `pattern` list will have an alternating sequence of `'A'` and `'B'` with a total length of `n`.
