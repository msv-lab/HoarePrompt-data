### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with `n` zeros.
     - It calls `make_array` for each clique, which modifies `arr` and `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - This function fills the `arr` list with a sequence of integers from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern.
     - It also sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the value of `clique`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Clique Calculation**:
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct based on the problem's constraints and the need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

   - **Array Initialization**:
     - Both `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized correctly as lists of `n` zeros.

   - **Array Filling**:
     - The `make_array` function fills `arr` with distinct integers from 1 to n in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for vertices within the same clique.
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to indicate the clique each vertex belongs to.

   - **Output**:
     - The program prints the `arr` list, which contains the assigned integers.
     - It prints the number of cliques.
     - It prints the `cliquess` list, which indicates the clique each vertex belongs to.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values.
   - For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the program correctly outputs:
     ```
     2 1
     1
     1 1
     ```
   - When `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the program correctly outputs:
     ```
     3 1 5 2 4
     2
     1 1 2 1 2
     ```

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The program correctly assigns integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the vertices within each clique are connected by edges according to the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem's requirements and correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
