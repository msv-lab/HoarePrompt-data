Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `i` is 0, and the last element of `a` is now the last element of `a` minus 1. If the first element of `a` is 0, then `g` is 1 and the first element of `a` remains 0. Otherwise, `g` remains 0.***
