Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, and `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.***
