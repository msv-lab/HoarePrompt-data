Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the grid. The function should output "YES" or "NO" for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.**
