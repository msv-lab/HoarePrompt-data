Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`. The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `_` is still 0. The new variables `n` and `m` are now integers based on the input.
