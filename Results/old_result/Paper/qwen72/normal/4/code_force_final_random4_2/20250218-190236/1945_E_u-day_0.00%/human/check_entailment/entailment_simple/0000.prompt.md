Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input, which is not directly related to the problem's core logic.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input string into a sequence of integers, where the input string is split by spaces.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, so there are no specific preconditions related to the function's parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling the function `func_1()`. The contents of the list depend on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided, so the exact values in the list cannot be determined.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, and arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of size n with elements ranging from 1 to n.

    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.

If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`), `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.
    if (arr[low] == k) :

    else :

        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low is the index of the element just less than or equal to k, and pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k is found, otherwise pos is -1)
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`), `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `pos` remains as it was determined earlier.
