Output State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers from the user and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2` using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The value of `y` is calculated as `a + b` using the new values of `a` and `b`.
- The condition for skipping the current iteration of the loop (if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd) remains the same, but it will be evaluated using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
