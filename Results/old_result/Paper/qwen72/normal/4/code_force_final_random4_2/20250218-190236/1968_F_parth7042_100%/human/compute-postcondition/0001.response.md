Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries` where `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `queries` is a list of tuples representing the queries. Each `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `q` satisfies 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` with 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings. `index` is 0.**
