The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 1**
