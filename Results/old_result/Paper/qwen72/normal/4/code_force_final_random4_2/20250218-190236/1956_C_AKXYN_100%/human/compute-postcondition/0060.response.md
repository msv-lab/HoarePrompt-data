Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `'1 %d' % i`. This is a formatted string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This uses the `*` operator to unpack the range, which generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Values**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` will print `1` followed by the value of `i`.
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
- The string `1` followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`).
- Followed by a space-separated list of integers from 1 to `n`.

For example, if `n` is 5:
- `i` would be `5-1` which is 4.
- The range `range(1, 5 + 1)` would generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The output would be:
```
1 4 1 2 3 4 5
```

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-1] is the value of `i` and [n] is the value of `n`)**
