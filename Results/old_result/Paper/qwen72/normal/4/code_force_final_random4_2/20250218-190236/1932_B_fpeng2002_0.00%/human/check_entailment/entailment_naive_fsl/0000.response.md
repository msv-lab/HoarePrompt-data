Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, following the rules specified in the problem description. The function iterates through each sign and calculates the next occurrence year, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next year in which the current sign will occur, starting from the year immediately after the previous sign. This logic is consistent with the problem's requirements, and the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly.
