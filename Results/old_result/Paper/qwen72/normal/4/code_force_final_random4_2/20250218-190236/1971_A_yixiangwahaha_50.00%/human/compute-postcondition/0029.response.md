Postcondition: ***`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times, and `i` is 2. If `x[2]` is less than `y[2]`, the current value of `x[2]` is less than the current value of `y[2]`. Otherwise, the current value of `x[2]` is greater than or equal to `y[2]`.***
