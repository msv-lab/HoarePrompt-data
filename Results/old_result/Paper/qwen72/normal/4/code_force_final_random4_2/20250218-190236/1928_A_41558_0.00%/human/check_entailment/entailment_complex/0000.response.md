Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, as any cut will result in at least one non-integer dimension. This check is correct.

3. **Exact Half Check**: The second condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`). This is intended to catch cases where the rectangle can only be cut into two smaller rectangles that are identical to the original when rotated. However, this condition is not entirely correct. For example, a 4x2 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle again, which is considered the same as the original. The correct condition should be to check if one dimension is exactly twice the other, which would be `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`.

4. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if one dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Given the above reasoning, the second condition is incorrect, which means the program will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
