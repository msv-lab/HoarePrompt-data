Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged; `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 5`. Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 3` and `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) % MOD`. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is decremented by 1.
- If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` was originally `M1 - 4`, and after decrementing, it becomes `M1 - 5`.
- If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` was originally `M1 - 2`, and after decrementing, it becomes `M1 - 3`.
- The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
- The condition `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4 still holds.
- The value of `nums_left` is decreased by 1.
