Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `ans1` is equal to `a * n`.
   - `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `ans2` is the sum of two parts:
     - The integer division of `b * n` by 2, which gives the floor value of `b * n / 2`.
     - The remainder of `a * n` when divided by 2, which is `a * n % 2`.

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement will print the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a * n` will be a multiple of `n`.
   - `b * n // 2` will be an integer value, and `a * n % 2` will be either 0 or 1 (since it's the remainder of `a * n` divided by 2).
   - Therefore, `ans2` will be `b * n // 2` plus 0 or 1.
   - The exact values of `ans1` and `ans2` depend on the values of `a` and `b`, but the print statement will output the smaller of the two.

Given the initial state and the formulas for `ans1` and `ans2`, the output will be the minimum of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2) (where `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is the sum of the integer division of `b * n` by 2 and the remainder of `a * n` divided by 2)**
