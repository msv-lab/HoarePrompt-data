Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`.**

Explanation:
- `kq2` is initially an empty string.
- `kq2` is updated to include the first character of `a` (which is `a[0]`).
- The first character of `a` is the same as the first character of `b`, so `kq2` now contains this character.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
