Precondition: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases, each consisting of two lines as described. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**
