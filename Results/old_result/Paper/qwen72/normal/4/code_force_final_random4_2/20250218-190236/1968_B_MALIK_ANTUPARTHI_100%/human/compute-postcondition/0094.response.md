Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` updates the value of `k`.
- `k` is initially not defined in the initial state, so it is calculated based on the provided expression.
- `e[k:]` slices the string or list `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
- `d[j]` accesses the value at index `j` in the string or list `d`.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the sliced part of `e`.
- The result of `e[k:].index(d[j])` is then added to `1 + k` to get the new value of `k`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged.
