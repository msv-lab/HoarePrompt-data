Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` from the input. This is correctly implemented.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the three scores is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points in a draw). This check is logically correct.

3. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula is derived from the following observations:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The maximum number of draws occurs when the points are distributed as evenly as possible among the players.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the number of wins (since each win adds 2 points).

4. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are invalid.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because one draw could have occurred.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the function correctly prints `6` because six draws could have occurred.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred, and the rest of the points are distributed as wins.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
