### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Constructing the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The function initializes an empty string `ans` and a boolean `work` set to `True`.
   - It iterates through the characters of the strings `a` and `b` to construct the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
   - If the next character in `b` is smaller than the next character in `a` and `i + 1` is within bounds, it switches to appending characters from `b` and sets `work` to `False`.
   - If `i + 1` is out of bounds, it appends the current character from `b` and breaks the loop.
   - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The function initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, it increments the counter.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - If neither condition is met, it breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The function ensures that it always chooses the smallest possible character at each step, and it switches to the bottom row when necessary to maintain the smallest string.
  
- **Counting the Number of Paths**:
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is also correct. The function correctly identifies the points where the path can switch between the top and bottom rows and counts the number of such valid paths.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. The input and output handling is appropriate, and the loop logic is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
