The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than `n - 1`. Additionally, `bx` is greater than `ax`.**
