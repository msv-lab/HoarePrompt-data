The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the list `nodes`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `nodes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last element in `nodes`, and `nodes` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must contain at least two elements, and `j` will be the next element in `nodes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is `coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j]`, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain at least two elements. `j` is the second element in `nodes`.**
