Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 2 if `cnt` >= `n` or `i` is `k` if `cnt` < `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, and if `cnt` < `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it, followed by `n - cnt - 1` characters 'a'.**
