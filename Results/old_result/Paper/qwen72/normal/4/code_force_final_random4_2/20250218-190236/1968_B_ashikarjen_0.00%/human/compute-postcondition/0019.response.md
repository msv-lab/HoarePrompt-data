The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, `j` remains `m` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
