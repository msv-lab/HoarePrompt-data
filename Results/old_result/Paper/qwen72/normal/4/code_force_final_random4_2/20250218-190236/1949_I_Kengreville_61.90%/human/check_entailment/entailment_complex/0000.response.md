Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of the state of each disk, and an empty list `nodes` to store the indices of disks visited during the DFS.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is designed to explore the graph of disks, where each disk is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if the disks are tangent.
   - When a disk `i` is visited, it is marked as `True` in the `visited` list, and its index is added to the `nodes` list.
   - For each unvisited disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is exactly the sum of their radii), the function updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

3. **Sum Calculation and Decision**:
   - After performing DFS starting from each unvisited disk, the function calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the `nodes` list.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for any set of connected disks is non-zero, the function prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to change the radii as required.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is zero for all sets of connected disks, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to change the radii as required.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that disks `i` and `j` are tangent.
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are used to track the changes in radii. The function updates `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` based on the current disk `i` and the relationship between the disks.
   - The final decision is based on whether the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero. If it is, it means there is a way to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The condition in the `dfs` function should be `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` to ensure that disks are tangent.
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` updates should be correct to ensure that the sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency. The current update logic seems to be correct, but it is crucial to verify that the logic for `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` is sound.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks as required.
   - The DFS function correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists accordingly.
   - The final decision based on the sum of `coef1` is appropriate for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
