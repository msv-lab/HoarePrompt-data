Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If the integer value of the first character of `a` is greater than the integer value of the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
