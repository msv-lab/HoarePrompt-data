Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**

The code snippet `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` changes the value of `coef1[j]` to the negative of `coef1[i]`. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `coef1[j]` while maintaining all other initial conditions.
