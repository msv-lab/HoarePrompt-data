Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `res` is 0, and the value of `num` in `count` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1.
- The variable `res` is 0, indicating that `num` was already a key in the dictionary `count`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
