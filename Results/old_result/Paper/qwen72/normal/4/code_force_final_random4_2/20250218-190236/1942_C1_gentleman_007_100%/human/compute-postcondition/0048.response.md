Postcondition: ***`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`, so `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`.***
