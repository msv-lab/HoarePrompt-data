To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

### Current State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `j` is `j + 1` (relevant to the loop head)
- `j` must be less than `m` (relevant to the loop head)
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]` (relevant to the loop head)
- `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]` (not relevant to the loop head)

### Analysis:
1. **`j < m`**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `m`. Since `j` is `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue.
2. **`b[j] != a[i]`**: For the loop to execute again, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`. Since `i` is 1 and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]` at the end of the previous iteration, this condition must still hold true for the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` must be less than `m` (ensuring `j < m` is still true)
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]` (ensuring `b[j] != a[i]` is still true)

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration, adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time, is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `j` must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`**
