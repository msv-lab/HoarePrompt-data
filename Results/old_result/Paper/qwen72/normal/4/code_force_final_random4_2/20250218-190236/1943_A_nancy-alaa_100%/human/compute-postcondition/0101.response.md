Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 2. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
