The only object in the loop head is the deque `q`. The loop condition `while len(q):` checks if the deque `q` is not empty. For the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least one element. Right before the loop, `q` is a deque containing the value `ver`. Since `q` already contains one element (`ver`), the condition `len(q)` will evaluate to `True`, and the loop can proceed without any adjustments.

State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each entry represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` is a deque containing the value `ver`**
