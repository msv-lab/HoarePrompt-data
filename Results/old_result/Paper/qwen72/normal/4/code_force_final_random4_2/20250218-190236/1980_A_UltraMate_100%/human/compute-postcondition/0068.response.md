Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, and `i` is 'A'. If 'A' is not present in the input string `s`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
