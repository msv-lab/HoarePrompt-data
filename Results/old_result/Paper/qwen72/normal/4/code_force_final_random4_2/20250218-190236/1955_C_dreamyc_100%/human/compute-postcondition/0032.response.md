The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. 

Case_1: If the function returns the positive integer `n`, it indicates the number of elements in the list `nums`.

Case_2: If the function returns the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution, it means the function is counting occurrences where certain conditions involving `s_a` and `s_b` are met.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, a positive integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` positive integers. It can return either the number of elements in the list `nums` (Case_1), or the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution (Case_2).**
