Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the first integer in `ar`.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1).
- Since `minn` was initially `inf` and `same` is 1, `minn` is updated to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
