Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.**
