Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables (`nums`, `x`, `num_tests`, and `n`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states. `x` is still the length of `nums` minus 1, `num_tests` is still decreased by 1, and `n` is still an input integer.
