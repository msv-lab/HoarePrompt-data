The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the list `ans`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `ans` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `q` is the first element in `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `ans` (if it exists) will be assigned to `q`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the second element in `ans`, and `ans` must contain at least two elements.

State: **`ans` must contain at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.**
