The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. It returns a tuple of three values: the first value is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b`, and the second and third values are coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively computes the GCD and the coefficients.
