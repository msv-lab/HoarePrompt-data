#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries` where `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `queries` is a list of tuples representing the queries. Each `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `q` satisfies 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` with 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `index` is `7 + 2*t*q`, `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length `t*q`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [t*q lines of 'YES' or 'NO' (where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' and t*q is the length of the results list)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of query tuples `queries`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero. If the XOR is zero, or if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`, the function appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the function prints the results, one per line. The final state of the program is that `index` is `7 + 2*t*q` and `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length `t*q`.
