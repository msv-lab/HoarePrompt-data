The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. The loop will continue to execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 22, `i` is 4, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**
