Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` positions. The left shift operation `1 << cur_ss` results in a value that is `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. Therefore, `cur` is increased by `2` to the power of `cur_ss`. The states of `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
