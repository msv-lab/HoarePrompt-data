Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was removed from `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`, inclusive.**
