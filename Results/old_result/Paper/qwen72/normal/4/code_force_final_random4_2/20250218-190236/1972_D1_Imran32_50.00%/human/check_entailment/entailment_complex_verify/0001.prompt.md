You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer. It then calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `n` and a series of terms derived from `n` and its square root. Specifically, `ans` is computed as `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each integer `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Function Name and Parameters:**
     - The function `func_1()` should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters, but it is reading them inside the function. This is not a major issue but could be cleaner.
     - The variable \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which is a mistake.
   - **Incorrect Logic:**
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The loop and the calculation of `cnt` and the update to `ans` do not seem to be related to the problem statement.
   - **GCD Calculation:**
     - The program does not use the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **Pair Counting:**
     - The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition.
   - However, this approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach would involve using properties of GCD and divisors to reduce the number of iterations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Correctness:
**False**
