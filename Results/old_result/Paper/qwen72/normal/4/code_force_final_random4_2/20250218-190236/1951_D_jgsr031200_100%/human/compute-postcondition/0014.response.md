Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`.
- `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- Therefore, `h` is now equal to `n // (n - k + 1)`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k, still holds true.
