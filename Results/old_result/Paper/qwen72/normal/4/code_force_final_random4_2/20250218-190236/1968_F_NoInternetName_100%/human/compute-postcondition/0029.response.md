Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0. If `upper` > `lower`, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` > `lower`. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` ≤ `lower`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `l, r = func_1(int)` updates the values of `l` and `r` to the values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
- The initial state specifies that `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, so no further changes are needed for these variables.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `lower`, and `upper`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions for `lower` and `upper` are still valid and will be evaluated based on the new values of `l` and `r`.
