Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0.**

The code snippet `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state specifies that these input integers are each greater than 0, and the other variables (`t`, `p_i`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
