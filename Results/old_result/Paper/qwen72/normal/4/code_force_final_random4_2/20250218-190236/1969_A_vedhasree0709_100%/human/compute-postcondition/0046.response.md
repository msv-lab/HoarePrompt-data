Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `p` is the first integer in the list `l`, and `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` is equal to 1, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
