Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[0]`, and `j` is not less than `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
