The function operates in an interactive environment where the input sequence is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
