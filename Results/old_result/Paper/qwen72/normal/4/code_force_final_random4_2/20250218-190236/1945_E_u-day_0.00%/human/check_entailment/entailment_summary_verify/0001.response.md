### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to parse the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is used to parse the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == x`. This is done correctly.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the value at `arr[mid]`. This is a standard binary search logic, but it assumes the array is sorted, which is not the case here.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the loop, it means the binary search would have found `x` correctly, and the program outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != x`, the program outputs `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is correct in the sense that it will narrow down the search range to a single element.
  - However, the binary search assumes the array is sorted, which is not the case here. The program is designed to handle the unsorted permutation by allowing up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - If `arr[low] != x` after the binary search, the program suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.
  - This swap ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

- **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
  - The problem description states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only performs 1 swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - This might be a limitation, but the problem also states that 2 operations are always sufficient, and the program is not required to minimize the number of swaps.
  - The program's approach is valid because it ensures that the binary search will find `x` with a single swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
  - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by suggesting a single swap.

### Issues:

- **Binary Search Assumption:**
  - The binary search logic is based on the assumption that the array is sorted, which is not the case. However, the program's approach of performing a single swap to correct the position of `x` is sufficient to make the binary search work in the given context.

- **Multiple Swaps:**
  - The program only performs 1 swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps. The problem does not require minimizing the number of swaps, so this is not an issue.

- **Set Usage:**
  - The use of the set `st` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the program. It can be removed without changing the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:

- The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs a swap to ensure the binary search will find `x`. The program does not need to handle more than 1 swap in the given context, as it is not required to minimize the number of swaps.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
