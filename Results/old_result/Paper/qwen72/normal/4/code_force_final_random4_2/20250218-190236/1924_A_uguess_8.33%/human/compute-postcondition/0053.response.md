Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a combination of characters in `s` that set all bits in `cur` to 1, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to a new input string.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is an input string, and the initial state information about `s` being an input string is still valid.
- The conditions and relationships involving `cnt` and `cur` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
