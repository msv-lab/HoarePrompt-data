The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the implicit `4` in `range(4)`. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value, which is always true since `range(4)` will generate values from 0 to 3. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the loop head variables. However, the state of `coord` being an empty list and `res` being 0 are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the initial state.

Since the loop will execute 4 times regardless of the initial state of `coord` and `res`, the only thing to ensure is that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
