The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. The tree is represented as a list of lists, where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes adjacent to the corresponding node. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- Case_1: If the start node is the same as the target node, the function returns 0.
- Case_2: If the target node is found during the breadth-first search (BFS), the function returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the target node, where `dist` is the distance of the first tuple that was in the `queue` before it was processed.
- Case_3: If the BFS completes and the target node is found, the function returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`. `dist` is the value of the distance component of the tuple that was at the front of the `queue` before the operation, and `current` is the node that was at the front of the `queue` before the operation.
- Case_4: If the target node is not found in the tree starting from the start node, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It returns 0 if the start node is the same as the target node. If the target node is found during the BFS, it returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the BFS completes and the target node is found, it returns the distance from the start node to the current node. If the target node is not found, it returns -1.**
