The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must have at least two elements.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least two elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`**
