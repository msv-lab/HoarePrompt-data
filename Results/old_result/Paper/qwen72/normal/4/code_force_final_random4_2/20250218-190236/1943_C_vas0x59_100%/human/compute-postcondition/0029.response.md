Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is -3, `u` is `u + 2`, `v` is `v + 2`, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
