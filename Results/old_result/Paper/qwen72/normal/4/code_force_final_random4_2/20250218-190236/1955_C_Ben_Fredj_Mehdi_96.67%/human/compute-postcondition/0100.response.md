Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2 and odd, `i` is `k // 2 - 1`. If no exception occurs, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs at any point, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
