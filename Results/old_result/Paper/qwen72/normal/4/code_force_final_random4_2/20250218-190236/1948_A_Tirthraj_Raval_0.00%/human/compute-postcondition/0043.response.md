Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `pattern` is an empty list if `n` is even, `pattern` is `['A']` if `n` is even.**

Explanation: The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends the character 'A' to the list `pattern` because `i` is 0, and `0 % 2` equals 0, which corresponds to the character 'A' in the string 'AB'. Since `n` is even, the initial state of `pattern` being an empty list is updated to `['A']`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
