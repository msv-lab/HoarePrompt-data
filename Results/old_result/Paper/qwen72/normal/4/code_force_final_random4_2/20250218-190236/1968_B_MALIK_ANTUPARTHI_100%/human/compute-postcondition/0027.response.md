Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 2, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
