### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Function Name and Parameters:**
     - The function `func_1()` should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters, but it is reading them inside the function. This is not a major issue but could be cleaner.
     - The variable \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which is a mistake.
   - **Incorrect Logic:**
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The loop and the calculation of `cnt` and the update to `ans` do not seem to be related to the problem statement.
   - **GCD Calculation:**
     - The program does not use the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **Pair Counting:**
     - The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations provide a clear state of the program at key points.
   - The state before the function call indicates that the function should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters, but it reads them inside the function.
   - The state inside the function shows that `k` is used instead of `m`, which is incorrect.
   - The state after the loop indicates that the program is performing an unrelated calculation and does not correctly implement the problem's logic.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition.
   - However, this approach is inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). A more efficient approach would involve using properties of GCD and divisors to reduce the number of iterations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs. The issues identified in the original assessment are accurate and the program's behavior does not match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
