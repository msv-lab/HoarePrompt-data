Postcondition: ***`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers with `a[0]` and `a[r]` both decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2` if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `ans` is 3 if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`.***
