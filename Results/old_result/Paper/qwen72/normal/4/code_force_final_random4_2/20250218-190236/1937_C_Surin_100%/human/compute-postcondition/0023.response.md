Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - `r` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` is set to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is initially set to 1.
   - `v2` is set to 3.
   - The value of `v1` can change based on the condition `r == '<'`. If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` is set to 2. Otherwise, `v1` remains 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` will be 2. The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `r` is not equal to '<', then `v1` will remain 1. The print statement will output: `? 1 1 3 3`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both cases:

- If `r` is '<':
  Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
- If `r` is not '<':
  Output: **? 1 1 3 3**

Given that we don't have the exact value of `r`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 3 3 (where v1 is 2 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 1)**
