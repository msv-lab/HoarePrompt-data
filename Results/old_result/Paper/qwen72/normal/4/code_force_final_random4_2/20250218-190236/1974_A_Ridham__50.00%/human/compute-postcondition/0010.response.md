Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

The value of `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1`. Since `y` is an odd integer, `y // 2` will give the integer part of the division of `y` by 2, and adding 1 to this result gives the value of `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
