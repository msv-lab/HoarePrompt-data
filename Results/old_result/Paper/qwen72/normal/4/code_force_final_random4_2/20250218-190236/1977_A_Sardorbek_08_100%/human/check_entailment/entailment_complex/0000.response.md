Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled as per the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function then enters a loop that iterates `a` times, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the function reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case, which are the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`. This is also correctly handled.
4. **Conditions and Outputs**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), the function prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves made.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the function prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have the same parity, the difference between `b` and `c` is even, and Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
   - If `b` and `c` have different parities, the function prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, the difference between `b` and `c` is odd, and it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.

5. **Output Format**: The function prints 'YES', 'Yes', 'NO', or 'No' as required by the problem description. The output is case-insensitive, so both 'YES' and 'Yes' are acceptable for a positive answer, and both 'NO' and 'No' are acceptable for a negative answer.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
