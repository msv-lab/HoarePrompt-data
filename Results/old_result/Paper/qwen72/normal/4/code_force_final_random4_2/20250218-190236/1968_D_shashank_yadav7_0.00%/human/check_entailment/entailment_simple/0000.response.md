### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The loop iterates `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - On each turn, the players' positions are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the maximum of the current score and the score if the player stays at the current position plus the score of the next position.
   - The current scores `bp` and `sp` are also updated by adding the values at the new positions.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the function compares the final scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Update:**
  - The score updates inside the loop are incorrect. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are not logically sound. The score should be updated based on the current position and the next position, not by taking the maximum of the current score and a scaled score.
  - The correct update should be `bm += a[b]` and `sm += a[s]`.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop decrements `k` but does not use it correctly to terminate the loop. The loop should run exactly `k` times, not until `k` reaches 0.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        sp = 0
        bp = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided.

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect.
