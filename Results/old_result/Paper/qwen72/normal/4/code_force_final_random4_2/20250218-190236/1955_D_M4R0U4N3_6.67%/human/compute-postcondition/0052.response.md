Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `n` must be greater than `r + 1`, `ans` is 0 or 2 depending on the number of elements in `done`, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, `done` now contains `a[r]`, and the state of `extra` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` in these sets.**

Explanation:
- The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`.
- Since `r` is `r + 1`, the value of `a[r]` is `a[r + 1]`, which is `a[3]` (assuming `r` was initially 2).
- The value of `a[3]` is `k` (since `a` contains `n`, `m`, and `k`).
- Therefore, `k` is added to the set `done`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The state of `todo` remains the same, as it no longer contains `a[r]` (which is `a[3]` or `k`).
- The state of `extra` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` in these sets.
