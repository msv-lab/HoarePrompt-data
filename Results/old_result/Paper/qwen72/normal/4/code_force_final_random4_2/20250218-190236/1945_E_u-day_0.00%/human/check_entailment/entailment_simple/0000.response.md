Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `func_1()` and `func_2()`. These functions are designed to parse the input for each test case, where `func_1()` reads the integers `n` and `k`, and `func_2()` reads the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**: The program correctly finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using a simple loop. This is necessary to determine where `k` is located in the unsorted permutation.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is implemented correctly, but it is performed on an unsorted permutation. The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted, and if it is not, the results can be incorrect. However, the problem statement allows for up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before the binary search is performed.

4. **Outputting the Result**: The program outputs the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k` after the binary search, it prints 0, indicating no swaps were needed. Otherwise, it prints 1 and the indices of the swap that would place `k` at the correct position for the binary search to succeed.

5. **Handling the Swap**: The program correctly identifies the index `low` where the binary search would place `k` if the array were sorted. It then swaps the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (the actual position of `k` in the permutation).

However, there are a few issues to consider:

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation. If `k` is not in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1, and the program will attempt to print `low + 1, pos + 1`, which will result in an invalid swap (since `pos + 1` will be 0, which is out of bounds).

- **Multiple Swaps**: The problem allows for up to 2 swaps, but the program only performs 1 swap. This is generally sufficient, but the program should be able to handle cases where 2 swaps are needed if the initial permutation is very unsorted.

- **Binary Search Termination**: The binary search loop condition `low + 1 < high` is correct, but the program does not explicitly handle the case where `low` and `high` converge to the same index. This is implicitly handled by the loop, but it could be clearer.

Given these considerations, the program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with handling the case where `k` is not found in the permutation. This can be fixed by adding a check to ensure `pos` is not -1 before performing the swap.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, you can add a check to ensure `pos` is not -1 before performing the swap:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break  # No need to continue searching once k is found

    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid

    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    elif pos != -1:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
    else:
        print(0)  # k is not in the permutation, so no swaps are needed
```

This ensures that the program handles the case where `k` is not found in the permutation correctly.
