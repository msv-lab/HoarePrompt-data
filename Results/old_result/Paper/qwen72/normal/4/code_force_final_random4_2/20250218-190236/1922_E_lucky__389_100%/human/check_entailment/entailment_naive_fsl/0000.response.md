Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `x` is a power of 2 correctly. Specifically, when `x` is a power of 2, the program enters an infinite loop because the condition `2 ** i <= x` will always be true for `i` starting from 0, and it will never decrement `x` to 0. For example, if `x = 8`, the program will keep appending `3` to `subseq_lens` and subtracting `4` from `x`, but `x` will never reach 0, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

To fix this, the loop should correctly handle the case when `x` is a power of 2 by breaking out of the loop once `x` is reduced to 0. Additionally, the program should handle the case where `x` is 1, which is not currently addressed.
