Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 1`, `suff[n - 1]` is `c[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suff[i]` to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `suff[n - 1]` is updated to `suff[n] + c[n - 1]`. Given that `suff[n]` is 0 (as `suff` is initialized with zeros), `suff[n - 1]` becomes `c[n - 1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
