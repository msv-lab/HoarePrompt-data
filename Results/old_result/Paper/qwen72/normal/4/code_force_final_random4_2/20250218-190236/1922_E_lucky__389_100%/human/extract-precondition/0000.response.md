Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].**
