Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `p3`. Additionally, the current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2 - y`.**
