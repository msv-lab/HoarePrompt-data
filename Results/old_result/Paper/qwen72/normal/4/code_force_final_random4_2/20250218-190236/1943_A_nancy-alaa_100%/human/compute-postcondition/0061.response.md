Postcondition: ***_ is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the loop breaks and `first` remains True. Otherwise, the loop continues without any changes to the variables.***
