Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a test case.
