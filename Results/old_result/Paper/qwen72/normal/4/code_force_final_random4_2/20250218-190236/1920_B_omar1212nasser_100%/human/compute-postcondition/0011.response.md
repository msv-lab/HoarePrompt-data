The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the value that allowed the loop to execute, and `removals` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `removals` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
