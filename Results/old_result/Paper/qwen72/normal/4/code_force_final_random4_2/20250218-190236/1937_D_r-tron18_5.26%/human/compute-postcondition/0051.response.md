Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` remains `n - 2`, `n` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 500,000, `el` is still the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, and `suffZero` still has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`. Additionally, `ol` is now equal to `totalOne`, and `zr` is now equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1.
