You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from user input, and for each integer from 0 to `a-1`, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from user input. It then checks the following conditions for each pair of `b` and `c`: if `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'; if `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'; if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function. After the function concludes, `a` will be an integer between 0 and 100, and `q` will be a tuple containing the last values of `b` and `c` that were read.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `elif a % 2 == b % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, this is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c` because the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This is correct if the parity condition is fixed.

3. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be:
     - `if (b - c) % 2 == 0` or `if b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect must be an even number of changes to reach the desired height.

### Conclusion:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Correctness:
**False**
