Let's break down the initial state and the operations described to understand what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \neq k\).
- \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

### Operations Before the Loop:
1. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - The first element of `costs` is \(n - k + 1\).
   - The second element of `costs` is \(1\).

   Therefore, `h` is calculated as:
   \[
   h = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor
   \]
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) is the integer division of `n` by \(n - k + 1\).
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor\) is simply `n`.

   So, `h` becomes:
   \[
   h = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n
   \]

2. **Update `n`**:
   - `n` is updated by subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
   - The first quotient is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The second quotient is \(n\).

   Therefore, `n` is updated as:
   \[
   n = n - \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1) + n \cdot 1 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   n = n - \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1) + n \right)
   \]
   \[
   n = n - \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1) + n \right)
   \]
   \[
   n = n - n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1)
   \]
   \[
   n = - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1)
   \]

   Since \(n \geq k\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) is at least 1. Therefore, the product \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \cdot (n - k + 1)\) is at least \(n - k + 1\), which means `n` will be negative after this operation. However, the problem states that `n` is a positive integer, so this operation must be interpreted in a way that ensures `n` remains non-negative. Given the constraints, the most reasonable interpretation is that `n` is set to 0 after the operation.

3. **Condition on `h`**:
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final State:
- After the operations, `n` is 0.
- `h` is still greater than or equal to `k`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print('YES')` statement is executed, and it will print the string 'YES'.
- The values of `n` and `h` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is a simple constant string.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
