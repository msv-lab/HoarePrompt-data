Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and the current value of `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**
