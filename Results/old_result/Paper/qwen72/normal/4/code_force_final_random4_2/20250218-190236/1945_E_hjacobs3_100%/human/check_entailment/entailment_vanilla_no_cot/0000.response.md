Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is incorrect. The binary search should start with `l = 0` and `r = n`, not `l = 0` and `r = n + 1`. Additionally, the condition `if r - l > 1` should be `if r - l > 1 or array[l] != find` to ensure the search continues until the correct element is found or the search space is exhausted.

2. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as required. The output should first print the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The provided program prints the number of operations inside the `func_1` function, which is not the correct place.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The `func_1` function should return the number of operations and the operations themselves, and the main loop should print these results.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to perform the swaps before running the binary search. It directly runs the binary search and checks if the element is in the correct position, which is not the intended approach.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    (k, operations) = func_1(array, x)
    print(k)
    for op in operations:
        print(' '.join(map(str, op)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    x_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Perform the swaps to make the binary search work
    operations = []
    if array[0] > find:
        operations.append((1, x_index + 1))
        array[0], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[0]
        x_index = 0
    
    if array[n // 2] > find:
        operations.append((n // 2 + 1, x_index + 1))
        array[n // 2], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[n // 2]
        x_index = n // 2
    
    if len(operations) > 2:
        return (2, operations[:2])
    
    # Perform binary search
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l] == find:
        return (len(operations), operations)
    else:
        return (2, operations + [(1, x_index + 1)])  # Fallback to 2 operations if needed
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Swapping Logic**: The program first identifies the index of the element `x` in the array. It then performs up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search will find the element `x` correctly.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is implemented correctly, with the initial values of `l` and `r` set to `0` and `n` respectively.
3. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the number of operations and the operations themselves for each test case.
4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case in a loop.

This corrected program should now work as intended for the given problem description.
