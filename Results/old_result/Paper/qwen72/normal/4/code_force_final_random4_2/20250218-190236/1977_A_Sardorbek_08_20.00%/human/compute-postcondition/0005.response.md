Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means `t` can be any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\). This means `n` and `m` can be any integers between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `a` must be greater than 0. This means `a` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 0. This means `i` is initialized to 0.
- `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`, and `b` is equal to `c`. This means `q` is a tuple where the first and second elements are the same integer.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and their constraints, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
