To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the variables `x` and `y` as they are the only ones in the loop head condition (`while y >= x`).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `x` is 0
- `y` is equal to `p3`

The loop condition is `while y >= x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `y` is already greater than or equal to `x`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `x` or `y` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3`**
