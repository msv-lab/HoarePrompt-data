Reasoning:

The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps such that a binary search will correctly find the element `x` at the position `l` after the search. The annotated program provided does not actually perform the swaps; instead, it only identifies the swap that would be needed if `l` is not the correct position for `x`.

Let's break down the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the permutation.
   - It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - The loop continues until `r - l` is 1, which is the standard termination condition for binary search.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and adjusts `l` or `r` based on the comparison between `array[mid]` and `x`.

3. **Post-Search Check:**
   - After the loop, `l` should be the position where `x` would be if the array were sorted.
   - The program checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x` by comparing `l` with `array.index(find)`.
   - If `l` is not the correct position for `x`, it prints 1 and returns the indices to swap to correct the position.
   - If `l` is the correct position, it prints 0 and returns nothing.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps needed and the indices of the elements to swap if needed.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array:**
  - The binary search algorithm assumes the array is sorted. Since the array is a permutation and not sorted, the binary search may not find the correct position for `x`.
  - The program does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the array is in a state where the binary search will work correctly.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program only identifies a single swap if `l` is not the correct position for `x`. However, the problem allows for up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
  - The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed to make the binary search work.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle the requirement to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works. It only identifies a single swap, which is not sufficient in all cases.
- The binary search itself is not guaranteed to work correctly on an unsorted permutation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **False**
