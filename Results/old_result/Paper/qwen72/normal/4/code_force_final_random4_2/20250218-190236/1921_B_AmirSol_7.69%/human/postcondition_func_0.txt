The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1`, and `s2` (two strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters). It returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ. If two consecutive positions in `s1` and `s2` differ and the characters in `s1` at these positions are also different, the function counts this as a single difference. The final state of the program is that `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, and the function has returned the computed count.
