To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used in the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to new input integers.
- If the new `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds.
- If the new `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds.
- If the new `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the condition `b - a < n` holds.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `b` and `a` are integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - The conditions provided help us understand the relationship between `b`, `a`, and `n`.

2. **Formula Breakdown:**
   - The formula inside the `print` statement is: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - This formula calculates the integer part of the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

3. **Conditions and Their Impact:**
   - **If `b <= a`:**
     - The formula will still be evaluated, but the specific values of `b`, `a`, and `n` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical result.
   - **If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`:**
     - This condition implies that `b` is significantly larger than `a` and `n`.
   - **If `b > a` and `b - a < n`:**
     - This condition implies that `b` is only slightly larger than `a` and `n` is larger than the difference between `b` and `a`.

4. **General Output:**
   - The output will be the integer part of the result of the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.
   - The exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `b` and `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula and the conditions given.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where `b` and `n` are integers, and the conditions `b <= a`, `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, or `b > a` and `b - a < n` hold based on the new input values)**
