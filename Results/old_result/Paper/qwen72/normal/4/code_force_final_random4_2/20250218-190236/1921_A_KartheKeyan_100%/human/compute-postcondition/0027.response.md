The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range of the loop, which is fixed at 4. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
