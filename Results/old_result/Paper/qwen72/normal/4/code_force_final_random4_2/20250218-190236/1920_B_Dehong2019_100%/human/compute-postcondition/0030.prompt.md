Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, and `i` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a` plus the integer at index `i` in the list `a` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a` plus the integer at index `i` in the list `a` but without the adjustment for `i + x` being out of bounds, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is adjusted to be `ans1 - 2 * a[2 + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the first integer in the list `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x` in the list `a` plus the integer at index `i` in the list `a` but without the adjustment for `i + x` being out of bounds. `ans2` is the maximum of the current `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
