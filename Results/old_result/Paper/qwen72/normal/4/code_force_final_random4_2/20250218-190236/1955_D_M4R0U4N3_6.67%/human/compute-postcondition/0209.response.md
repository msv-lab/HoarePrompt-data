Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, and `a[r]` is no longer in `todo`. `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body. `done` now contains `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is the set `extra` with `a[m]` removed, and `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `todo` now contains `a[m]`, `done` no longer contains `a[m]`, and `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`. If `old` is neither in `extra` nor in `done`, `todo` and `done` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
