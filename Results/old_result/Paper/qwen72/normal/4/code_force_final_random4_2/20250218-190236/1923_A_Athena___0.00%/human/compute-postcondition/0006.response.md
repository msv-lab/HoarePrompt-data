The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, after executing this code, the list `a` will no longer contain the first element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with the first element removed, `res` is 0**
