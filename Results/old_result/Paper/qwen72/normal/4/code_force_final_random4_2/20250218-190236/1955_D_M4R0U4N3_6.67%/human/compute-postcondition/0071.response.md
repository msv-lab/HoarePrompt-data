To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the given code snippet).
   - `n` is an integer greater than `m`.
   - `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `k` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `todo` is a set of integers that were not in `a` and were not moved to `done`.
   - `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, plus any other elements from `a` that were in `todo` and moved to `done` during the loop.
   - `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus any other elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and added to `extra` during the loop.
   - `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) < k`.

2. **Understanding the Sets:**
   - `todo` is a set of integers that were not in `a` and were not moved to `done`.
   - `done` is a set that starts with the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and are removed from `todo`.
   - `extra` is a set that starts with the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were not in `todo`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates until `j` is greater than `r`.
   - In each iteration, elements from `a` are checked and moved to `done` or `extra` based on their presence in `todo`.
   - The value of `ans` is determined based on the number of elements in `done` relative to `k`.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is `n - 1`, which is greater than `m - 1` (since `n > m`).
   - `a` contains `n`, `m`, and `k`.

5. **Set Initialization:**
   - `todo` is initially a set of integers not in `a`.
   - `done` is initially a set of integers from `a` that are in `todo`.
   - `extra` is initially a set of integers from `a` that are not in `todo`.

6. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 2` to `j < n - 1`.
   - During each iteration, the elements of `a` are checked and moved to `done` or `extra` based on their presence in `todo`.
   - The number of elements in `done` will be checked against `k` to determine the value of `ans`.

7. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - If `len(done) >= k` during the loop, `ans` will be the number of iterations where this condition is true.
   - If `len(done) < k` during the loop, `ans` will be the number of iterations where this condition is true.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the exact number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements in `todo`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise the number of iterations where `len(done) < k`)**
