You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, and arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of size n with elements ranging from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`), `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where low is the index of the element just less than or equal to k, and pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k is found, otherwise pos is -1)
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`), `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`), `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `pos` remains as it was determined earlier.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It returns the index of `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is found. If `k` is not found, the behavior is unspecified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
