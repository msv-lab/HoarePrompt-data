Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
- `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is a function call with `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments, and its result is multiplied by 2 to get `zeroInd`.
- The specific value of `zeroInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is expressed as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
