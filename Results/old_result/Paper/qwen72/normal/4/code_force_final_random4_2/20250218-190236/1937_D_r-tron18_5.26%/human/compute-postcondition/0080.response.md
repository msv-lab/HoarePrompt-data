Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- `oneInd` is assigned the value `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged.
