Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1.**

The code snippet `ans = 1` does not change the value of `ans` because it is already initialized to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
