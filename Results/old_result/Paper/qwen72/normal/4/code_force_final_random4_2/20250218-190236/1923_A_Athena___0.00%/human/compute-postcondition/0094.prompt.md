Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, representing the number of test cases. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    print(a)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a)`, and `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the new input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, and `res` is the number of zeros in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
