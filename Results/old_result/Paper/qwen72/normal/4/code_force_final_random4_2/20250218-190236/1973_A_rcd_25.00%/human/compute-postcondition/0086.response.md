The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it is implied that the function operates within a context where it uses or processes values `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The output of the function is not specified, so we can only infer that it processes these parameters in some way and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where it uses or processes integers `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` with the constraints 1 <= t <= 500 and 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
