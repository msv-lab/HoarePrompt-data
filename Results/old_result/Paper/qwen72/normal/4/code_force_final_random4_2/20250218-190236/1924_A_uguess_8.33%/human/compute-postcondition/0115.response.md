The only objects in the loop head are the string `s` and the variable `ss`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `ss` is the first character in `s`.
- `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
- If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at the position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `ss` must be the next character in the string `s`.
- `s` remains a non-empty string, but the next character in `s` will be used for `ss`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the next character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged unless the conditions specified in the loop body are met.**
