The code attempts to find the index of `i` in the list `b`. However, since `b` is not defined, a `NameError` is raised. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, and a `NameError` is raised because `b` is not defined.**
