Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r - l` must be greater than 1, `l` is now equal to `mid`.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `l`, which is now equal to `mid`. The other variables and conditions are still valid.
