Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first `i` elements of `a`, where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `n` if the loop completes all iterations, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, and `temp` is an index at which the loop breaks, which is not -1.**
