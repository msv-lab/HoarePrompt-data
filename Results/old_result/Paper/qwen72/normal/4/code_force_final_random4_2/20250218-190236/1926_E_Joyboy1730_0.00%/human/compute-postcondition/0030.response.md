Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (L[0] + a)`, `L` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L` + `a`, `pow` is 4. If `tot` < `k` and `k` <= `tot` + `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**
