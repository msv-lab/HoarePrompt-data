Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, when the print statement is executed, `i` will be replaced by the value of `n`.

2. **Formatted String `'1 %d' % i`**:
   - The `%d` in the string is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The value of `i` (which is `n`) will be inserted into this placeholder.
   - So, the string `'1 %d' % i` will become `'1 n'` where `n` is the actual value of `n`.

3. **Range Function `range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Unpacking the Range**:
   - The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - This means that each number in the sequence will be printed as a separate element.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will first print the string `'1 n'` where `n` is the value of `n`.
- Then, it will print the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` as separate elements.

### Example:
- If `n` is 3, the output will be:
  - `'1 3'` followed by `1 2 3`.

### General Output:
- For any value of `n` greater than 0, the output will be:
  - `'1 n'` followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n)**
