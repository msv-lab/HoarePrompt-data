### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will sink. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The program calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of attacks on the first ship and `b` is the number of attacks on the last ship. This is done using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will accumulate the total durability of the ships from the front and back respectively.

4. **Loop Through Ships**:
   - The program iterates through the list of ships from both ends simultaneously.
   - For each ship, it adds the durability to `s_a` and `s_b`.
   - If `s_a` (the accumulated durability from the front) is less than or equal to `a` (the number of attacks on the front), it increments `ans` by 1.
   - If `s_b` (the accumulated durability from the back) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of attacks on the back), it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Overcounting**: The program may overcount the number of ships sunk. For example, if a ship is attacked both from the front and the back, it will be counted twice in `ans`. This is incorrect because a ship can only be sunk once.
- **Incorrect Logic for Simultaneous Attacks**: The logic for determining which ships are sunk is flawed. The program should simulate the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and keep track of the remaining durabilities of the ships.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to use a more detailed approach. We can use a deque to simulate the ships and their durabilities, and then perform the attacks in the specified order.

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships and ships[-1] > 0:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
    
    return sunk
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Deque Initialization**: We use a deque to store the ship durabilities, which allows efficient popping from both ends.
- **While Loop**: The loop continues until either all attacks are performed (`k == 0`) or all ships have sunk (`ships` is empty).
- **First Ship Attack**: We decrement the durability of the first ship. If it sinks, we remove it from the deque and increment the `sunk` counter.
- **Last Ship Attack**: We decrement the durability of the last ship. If it sinks, we remove it from the deque and increment the `sunk` counter.
- **Break Condition**: If `k` becomes 0, we break out of the loop to avoid unnecessary operations.
- **Return**: Finally, we return the number of ships sunk.

This corrected program accurately simulates the Kraken's attacks and correctly counts the number of ships sunk.
