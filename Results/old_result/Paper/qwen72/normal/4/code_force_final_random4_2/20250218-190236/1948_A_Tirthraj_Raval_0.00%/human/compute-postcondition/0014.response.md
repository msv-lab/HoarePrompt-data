The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that is even and must be at least 4, and `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `n` is at least 4 and even, `n // 2` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 6 (so that `n // 2` is at least 3).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even and must be at least 6, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', `i` is 2**
