The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, and the number of test cases `t` should be an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
