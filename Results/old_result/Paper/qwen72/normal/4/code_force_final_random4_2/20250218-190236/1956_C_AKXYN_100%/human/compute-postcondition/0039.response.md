Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is defined as `n - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, so when the print statement is executed, `i` will be substituted with `n - 1`.
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted to include the value of `i`, resulting in `'2 [n-1]'`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will first output the string `'2 [n-1]'`.
   - Followed by the unpacked range from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-1] is the value of `n - 1` and `n` is the value of `n`)**
