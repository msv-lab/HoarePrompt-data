### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of parts, the number of colors, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

2. **Conditions for Output:**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color:
     - **Condition 1:** `n <= k`
       - If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
     - **Condition 2:** `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`
       - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color is less than `k`.
       - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.
       - If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the output should be 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

3. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 2:** `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true because `5 - 5 < 1` (since `math.ceil(5 / 1) = 5`), so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 3:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false because `5 - 3 < 1` (since `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`), so the output is 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 4:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true because `5 - 3 < 2` (since `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`), so the output is 'NO'.
   - **Test Case 5:** `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is false because `5 - 1 < 3` (since `math.ceil(5 / 5) = 1`), so the output is 'Yes'.
