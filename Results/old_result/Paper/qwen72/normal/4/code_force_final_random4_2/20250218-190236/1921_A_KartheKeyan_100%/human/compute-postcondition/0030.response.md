The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `4`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` is not relevant to the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
