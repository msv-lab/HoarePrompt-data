Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
3. `func_1(s[0:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
4. `x` is set to the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
5. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True. This means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1` to the end.
6. `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String `s` and Length `n`**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning the function returns True for the entire string `s`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, meaning the function returns True for the substring starting from index `x + 1` to the end of the string.

3. **Index `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to `s[0]`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

4. **Substrings**:
   - `s[:x + 2]` is the substring of `s` from the start to index `x + 1` (inclusive).
   - `s[x + 2:]` is the substring of `s` from index `x + 2` to the end.

### Example Scenario:
Let's consider an example string `s = "aabbcc"`. Here, `n = 6`.

- The first character `s[0]` is 'a'.
- The first character from index 1 to `n-1` that is not equal to 'a' is 'b' at index 2.
- Therefore, `x = 2`.

Given `x = 2`:
- `s[:x + 2]` is `s[:4]`, which is "aabb".
- `s[x + 2:]` is `s[4:]`, which is "cc".

### General Case:
- The substring `s[:x + 2]` will include the characters from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- The substring `s[x + 2:]` will include the characters from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

### Output:
The code will print the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.

Output: **s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start of the string up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of the string)**

### Example Output:
For `s = "aabbcc"`, the output will be:
Output: **aabb ' ' cc**
