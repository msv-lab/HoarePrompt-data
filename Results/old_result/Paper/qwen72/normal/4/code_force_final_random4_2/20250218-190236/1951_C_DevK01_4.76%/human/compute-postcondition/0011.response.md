Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the product of `m` squared and the sum of the first `n-1` integers.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`) remain unchanged.
