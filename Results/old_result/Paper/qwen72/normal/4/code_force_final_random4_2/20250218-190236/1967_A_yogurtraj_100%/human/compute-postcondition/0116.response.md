Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % 3`, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
