Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]` and then increased by `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, a[b] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * -1 + sp)`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- Since `k` is -1, `a[s] * k` is `a[s] * -1`.
- Therefore, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * -1 + sp)`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bm`, and `bp` remain unchanged, except for `bp` which is increased by `a[b]`.
- If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, `k` is -1, so this condition does not apply.
