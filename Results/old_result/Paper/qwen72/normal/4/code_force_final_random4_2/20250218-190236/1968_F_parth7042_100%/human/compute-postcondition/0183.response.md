Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 2`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` is a list with the last element being 'YES', and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
