Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true.**

Explanation:
- The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1.
- Therefore, `rem` is `k % 1`, which will always be 0 because any integer modulo 1 is 0.
- The values of the other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `y`, `i`) and the condition remain unchanged.
