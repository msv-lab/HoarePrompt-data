Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the value of `elements[-i]` from it.
- The other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus the integer at the position `elements[-i]`.
