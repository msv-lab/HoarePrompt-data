Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `n` must be greater than `r + 1`, `ans` is 0 or 2 depending on the number of elements in `done`, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`, and the state of `extra` and `done` remains unchanged based on the presence of `old` in these sets.**
