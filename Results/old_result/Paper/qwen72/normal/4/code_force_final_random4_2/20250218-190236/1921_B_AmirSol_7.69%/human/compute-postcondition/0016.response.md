Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `i` is increased by 2, `i` is less than `n`, `counter` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` is increased by 2, but it remains less than `n`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, and `counter` is still increased by 1.
