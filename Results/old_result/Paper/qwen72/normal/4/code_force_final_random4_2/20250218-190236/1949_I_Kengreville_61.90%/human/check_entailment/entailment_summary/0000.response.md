### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of the state of each disk.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component during the DFS.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - `dfs(i)` is a recursive function that marks the current disk `i` as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
   - It then checks all other disks `j` to see if they are tangent to disk `i` by verifying the condition \((r[i] + r[j])^2 = dx^2 + dy^2\), where \(dx\) and \(dy\) are the differences in the x and y coordinates of the disks.
   - If disk `j` is tangent to disk `i`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for disk `j` based on the values of disk `i` and recursively calls `dfs(j)`.

3. **Connected Components and Coefficients**:
   - For each unvisited disk `i`, `func_1` starts a DFS to explore the connected component of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - It initializes `coef0[i]` to 0 and `coef1[i]` to 1.
   - After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is not zero, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to change the radii in the desired manner. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Key Condition**:
   - The condition \((r[i] + r[j])^2 = dx^2 + dy^2\) ensures that disks `i` and `j` are tangent.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

5. **Checking the Sum of Coefficients**:
   - The sum of `coef1` for a connected component being non-zero implies that there is a way to adjust the radii of the disks in that component to achieve the desired result.
   - If all connected components have a sum of `coef1` equal to zero, it means that no such adjustment is possible, and the function prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. The use of DFS to explore connected components and the calculation of coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are appropriate for this problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
