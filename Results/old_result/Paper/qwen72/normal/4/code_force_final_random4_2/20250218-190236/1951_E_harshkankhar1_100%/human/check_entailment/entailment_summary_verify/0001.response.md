### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single part which is not a palindrome.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
     - It iterates through the string and sets `x` to the index of the first different character.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO".
     - This is correct because if all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
   - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because if `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the partition is valid.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
     - This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible partitions. For example, if `s` is "abba" and `x` is 1, the function will print "NO" even though "ab" and "ba" are valid non-palindromic partitions.
   - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is correct because if `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` will ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the condition where it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is indeed too restrictive and can lead to incorrect "NO" outputs for some valid cases. The suggested fix is also correct and will ensure that the string is partitioned into two non-palindromic parts whenever possible.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the condition that checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. The suggested fix in the original assessment is appropriate and should be implemented to make the program correct.
