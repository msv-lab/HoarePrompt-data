### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and validate the original assessment using the annotated code and the provided test case.

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input.

2. **Sum Check:**
   ```python
   if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
       print(-1)
       continue
   ```
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid, and the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total number of points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Simple Case:**
   ```python
   if p3 >= p1 + p2:
       print(p1 + p2)
   ```
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws can be the sum of the two smallest scores, as the third player can have all the remaining points from wins.

4. **Complex Case:**
   ```python
   else:
       low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
       cur = low
       while high >= cur:
           if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
               print(p1 - cur + p3)
               break
           else:
               cur += 1
       else:
           print(p3)
   ```
   - If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum of the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high`, checking if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

### Test Case Analysis:

Let's consider the test case `3 4 5`:

- **Sum Check:**
  - `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even), so the program proceeds.

- **Simple Case:**
  - `5 < 3 + 4` (true), so the program enters the complex case.

- **Complex Case:**
  - `low = min(5 - 3, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - `high = max(5 - 3, 5 - 4) = 2`
  - The loop iterates from `1` to `2`:
    - **Iteration 1:**
      - `cur = 1`
      - `p1 - cur = 3 - 1 = 2`
      - `p2 - (p3 - cur) = 4 - (5 - 1) = 0`
      - `2 > 0` (false), so the loop continues.
    - **Iteration 2:**
      - `cur = 2`
      - `p1 - cur = 3 - 2 = 1`
      - `p2 - (p3 - cur) = 4 - (5 - 2) = 1`
      - `1 <= 1` (true), so the program prints `p1 - cur + p3 = 3 - 2 + 5 = 6` and breaks the loop.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the test case `3 4 5` and prints `6`, which is the expected output. The original assessment's claim that the program outputs `8` for this test case is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the test case `3 4 5` and other provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
