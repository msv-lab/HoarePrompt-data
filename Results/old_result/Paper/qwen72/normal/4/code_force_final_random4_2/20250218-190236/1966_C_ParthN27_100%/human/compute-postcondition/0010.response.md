Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer that was provided initially.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged and contains the integers provided by the user.
- The set `s` now contains all the unique elements from the list `arr` up to the `n`-th index.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `arr` that was processed by the loop.
