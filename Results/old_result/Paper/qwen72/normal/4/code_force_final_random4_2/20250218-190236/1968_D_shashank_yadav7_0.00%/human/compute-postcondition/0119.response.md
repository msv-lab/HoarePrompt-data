Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, `k` is set to -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `b` is now `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`.**

The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`. All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.
