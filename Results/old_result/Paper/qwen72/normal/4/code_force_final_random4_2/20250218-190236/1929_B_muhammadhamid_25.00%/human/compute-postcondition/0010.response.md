Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). If `k` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 2 * n.***
