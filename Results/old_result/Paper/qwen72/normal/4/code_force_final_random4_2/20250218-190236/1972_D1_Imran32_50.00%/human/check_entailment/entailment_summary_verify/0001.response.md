### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Function Name and Parameters:**
     - The function `func_1()` should take \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters, but it is reading them inside the function. This is not a major issue but could be cleaner.
     - The variable \(k\) is used instead of \(m\), which is a mistake.
   - **Incorrect Logic:**
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The loop and the calculation of `cnt` and the update to `ans` do not seem to be related to the problem statement.
   - **GCD Calculation:**
     - The program does not use the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - **Pair Counting:**
     - The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Function Summary Evaluation:**
   - The function summary describes a function that calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of \(n\) and a series of terms derived from \(n\) and its square root. This does not align with the problem statement, which requires counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given condition.
   - The function summary does not mention the use of GCD or the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses an incorrect approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - The function summary confirms that the function `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem and the function summary confirms that the function `func_1` is not designed to meet the problem requirements.
