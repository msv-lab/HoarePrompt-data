Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks the relationship between these digits and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input integer `q` and the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are processed, and the final state of the program is that the results of the comparisons have been printed for all test cases. **
