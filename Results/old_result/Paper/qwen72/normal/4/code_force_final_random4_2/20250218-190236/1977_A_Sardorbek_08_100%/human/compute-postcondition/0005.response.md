Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
   - `a` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` and `c` are input integers.
   - `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.
   - `b` is equal to `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `b` is equal to `c` does not affect the `print` statement in any way.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and simply prints the string `'YES'`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
