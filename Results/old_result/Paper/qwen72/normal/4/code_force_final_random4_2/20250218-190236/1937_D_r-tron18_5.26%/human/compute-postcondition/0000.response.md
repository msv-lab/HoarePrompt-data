The code snippet `pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']` creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all characters in the string `s1` that are equal to `>`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`pre`**: This list is created by iterating over the string `s1` and collecting the indices (1-based) of characters that are `>`. For each character `el` in `s1` at index `i`, if `el` is `>`, then `i + 1` is added to the list `pre`.

2. **`s1` and `n`**: The values of `s1` and `n` remain unchanged. `s1` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters `<` and `>`, and `n` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^5\).

3. **Content of `pre`**: The list `pre` will contain the 1-based indices of all `>` characters in `s1`. If there are no `>` characters in `s1`, `pre` will be an empty list.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `<` and `>`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^5\), and `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all `>` characters in `s1`.**
