Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `not_mid` must be greater than 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now assigned the value `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `not_mid` must be greater than 2, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now assigned the value `big_element - 2`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
