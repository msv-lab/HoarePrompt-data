Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. Specifically, in the `if x > y` block, it prints `x, y` which is the maximum followed by the minimum, and in the `else` block, it prints `y, x` which is the minimum followed by the maximum. However, the problem description requires the output to always be the minimum followed by the maximum. This means the program will output the correct values in the wrong order for some cases.

For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will output `9 1` instead of `1 9`. This is incorrect according to the problem description.
