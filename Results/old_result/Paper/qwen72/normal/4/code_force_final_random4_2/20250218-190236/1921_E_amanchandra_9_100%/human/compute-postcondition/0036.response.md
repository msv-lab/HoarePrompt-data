Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is calculated as the maximum of 1 and the result of `b - x`. The value of `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
