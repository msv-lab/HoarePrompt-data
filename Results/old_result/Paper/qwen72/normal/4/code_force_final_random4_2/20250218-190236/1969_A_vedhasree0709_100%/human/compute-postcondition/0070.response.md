Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The initial value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `l` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing its previous state.
- The initial value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`.
- The initial value of `j` remains unchanged and is still 0.
