To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the state before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, which means `n` is already greater than 0. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted.

2. **Variable `i`:** The loop initializes `i` to 0 and increments it until it reaches `n-1`. The state before the loop indicates that `i` is `n-1`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.

The other variables (`max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`**
