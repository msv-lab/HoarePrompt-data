The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function is designed to handle test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.**
