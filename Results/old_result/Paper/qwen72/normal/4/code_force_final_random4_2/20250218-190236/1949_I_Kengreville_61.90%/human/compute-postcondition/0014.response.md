Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is the integer value of `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is the integer value of `y[i] - y[1]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `coef0[j]` to be the sum of `r[i]` and `r[j]`, minus the value of `coef0[i]`. Since `j` is 1, `coef0[1]` is now `r[i] + r[1] - coef0[i]`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
