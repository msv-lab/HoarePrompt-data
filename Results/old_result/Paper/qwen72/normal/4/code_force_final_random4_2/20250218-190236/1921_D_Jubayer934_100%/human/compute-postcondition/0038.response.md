Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, and `temp` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` updates the value of `b`.
- `input().split()` takes a space-separated string of integers and splits it into a list of strings.
- `map(int, input().split())` converts each string in the list to an integer.
- `sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)` sorts the list of integers in descending order.
- `[:m]` takes the first `m` elements from the sorted list.
- Therefore, `b` is now a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged.
