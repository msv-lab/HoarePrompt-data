### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for a pinball placed on the i-th cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`.
   - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`, where `l` is the length of `arr`.
   - This function is used to calculate the difference between the last element and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
   - It uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which is a prefix sum of the indices in `pre`.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element `0` and `ans` as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - It iterates over the string `s1` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters and updates the `ans` list.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

4. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters and their prefix and suffix sums.
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the necessary differences in the prefix and suffix sums.
   - The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated, and this list is printed to the console.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the grid is a single cell.
   - It also handles cases where the grid is entirely '<' or '>', and mixed cases.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes the string and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell, handling all edge cases and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
