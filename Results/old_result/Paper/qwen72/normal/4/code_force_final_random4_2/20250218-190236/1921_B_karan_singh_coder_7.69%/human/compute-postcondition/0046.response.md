Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is set to 0.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, `t1`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- `d` remains the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `_` is still incremented by 1.
