The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
