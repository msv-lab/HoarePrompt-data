Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is set to `n`.
   - Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, `i` will be equal to `n`.

2. **Value of `n`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is known to be a positive integer.

3. **Formatted String**:
   - The `print` statement uses the format `'2 %d' % i`, where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the formatted string will be `'2 %d' % n`, which will print `2` followed by the value of `n`.

4. **Range of Values**:
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the `print` statement will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - This means it will print all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will first print the string `'2 n'` (where `n` is the value of `n`).
- Then, it will print all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the range from 1 to n is printed)**
