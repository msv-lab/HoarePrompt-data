The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `x` is -1 or `k + 1` depending on the previous iteration's condition.**
