You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints the integers 1 and 0, each on a new line, and then returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` of integers such that the list has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` on a single line separated by spaces, and then returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to process the input \( X \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints 1 and 0, which is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and the empty subsequence.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into powers of 2. This is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length \( n \) can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each \( X \), it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \). It appends the exponent of this power to `subseq_lens`.
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum exponent found).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic of decomposing \( X \) into powers of 2 is correct. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` is also correct. The array is built such that it contains unique elements from 0 to `mx-1` and then the elements from `subseq_lens` to ensure the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program handles the special case \( X = 2 \) correctly by printing a single element array [0].

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently.
   - The program should ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. According to the problem, \( X \) is at least 2, so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, given the constraints and the way the array is constructed, the length should not exceed 200 for any valid \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented. It correctly decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array to match the number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:
**True**
