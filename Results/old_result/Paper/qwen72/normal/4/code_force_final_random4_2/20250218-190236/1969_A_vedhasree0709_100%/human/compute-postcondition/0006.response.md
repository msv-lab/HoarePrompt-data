Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is equal to the first element of `l`.**

The value of `p` is now the first element of the list `l`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
