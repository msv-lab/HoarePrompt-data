Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n - 1`. If `n` is 2, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop completed all iterations without breaking due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is 2, the program retains these conditions. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is updated to `n-2` and `ans` indicates the parity of the number of elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If `ans` is 1, it means the loop either broke early due to a difference greater than 1 or the number of such elements is odd. If `ans` is 0, the loop did not break early and the number of such elements is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 2, then `i` is 1 and `ans` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if there is at least one consecutive pair of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, or the loop did not break early due to a difference greater than 1. If `ans` is 0, it means there are no consecutive pairs of elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) where the difference is 1, and the loop did break early due to a difference greater than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
