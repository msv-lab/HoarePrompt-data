To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t):`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator. It will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration.
2. **Variable `t`**: This determines the number of times the loop will execute. The loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `func` is expected to take a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards.
- `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints.
- `c` is a list of length `n` with each element in the range `1 <= c_i <= 100`.
- `t` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will be incremented by 1 with each iteration.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
