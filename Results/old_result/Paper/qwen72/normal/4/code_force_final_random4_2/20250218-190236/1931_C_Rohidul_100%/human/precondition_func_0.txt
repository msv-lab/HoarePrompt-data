The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array for each test case. The length of each inner list n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
