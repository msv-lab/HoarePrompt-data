Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.**

The value of `r` is updated to the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and `l` is still the maximum of 1 and `d - x`.
