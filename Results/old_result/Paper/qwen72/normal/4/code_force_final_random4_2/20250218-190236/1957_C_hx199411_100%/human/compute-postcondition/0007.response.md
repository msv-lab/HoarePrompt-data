Postcondition: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid; `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**
