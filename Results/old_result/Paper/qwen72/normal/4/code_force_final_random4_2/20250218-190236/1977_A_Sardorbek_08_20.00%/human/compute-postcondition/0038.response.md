The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function internally uses or generates values for `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 for each test case. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not provided.**
