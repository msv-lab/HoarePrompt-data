You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, the program has printed 'YES' for all iterations. If `removed_count` is 0, the program has printed 'NO' for all iterations. Otherwise, the program has printed 'MAYBE' for all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of values `a` for the cubes.

2. **Sorting and Favorite Value:**
   - The program identifies the value of the favorite cube `favorite_value` by accessing `a[f - 1]`.
   - It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order to simulate the arrangement of cubes after Dmitry throws them.

3. **Counting Removed Cubes:**
   - The program initializes `removed_count` to 0, which will keep track of how many times the favorite value appears in the first `k` cubes after sorting.
   - It iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted list `sorted_a` and increments `removed_count` if the element is equal to `favorite_value`.

4. **Counting Total Favorite Cubes:**
   - The program counts the total number of cubes with the favorite value using `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`.

5. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it means all cubes with the favorite value were removed, so the program prints "YES".
   - If `removed_count` is 0, it means none of the cubes with the favorite value were removed, so the program prints "NO".
   - If `removed_count` is between 1 and `favorite_count - 1`, it means some cubes with the favorite value were removed, but not all, so the program prints "MAYBE".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly identifies the favorite value and sorts the list in non-increasing order.
- The program correctly counts the number of times the favorite value appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted list.
- The program correctly counts the total number of cubes with the favorite value.
- The program correctly determines the output based on the counts.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where the favorite value is unique and appears only once.
- The program handles cases where the favorite value appears multiple times.
- The program handles cases where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning all cubes are removed.
- The program handles cases where `k` is 1, meaning only the first cube is removed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided problem description and test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
