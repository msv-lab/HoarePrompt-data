To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200,000\).
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` (which was infinity) and the sums `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `c` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `suff` is a suffix sum array of `c`, meaning `suff[i]` is the sum of elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`.
   - `ans` is initially set to infinity and is updated to the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `j`, it calculates `a[j] + suff[j + 1]`.
   - `suff[j + 1]` is the sum of `c[j + 1]` to `c[n-1]`.
   - The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` and the calculated sum `a[j] + suff[j + 1]`.

4. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - After the loop, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum value of the sums `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value of `a[j] + suff[j + 1]` for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`)**
