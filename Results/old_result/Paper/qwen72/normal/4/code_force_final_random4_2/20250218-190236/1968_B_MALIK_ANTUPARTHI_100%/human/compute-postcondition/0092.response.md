Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[1]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[1]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
