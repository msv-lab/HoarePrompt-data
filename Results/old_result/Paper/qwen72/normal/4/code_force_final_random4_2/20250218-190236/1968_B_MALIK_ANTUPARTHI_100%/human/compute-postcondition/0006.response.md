To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(b):
```

The loop will execute if `b` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0
- `b` is an integer
- `c` is an integer
- The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `i` is 0
- `d` is an input value
- `e` is an input value
- `k` is 0

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, `j` is 0**
