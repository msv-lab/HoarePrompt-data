The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is set to 1. If `ans1` is '=', then `pair_idx` is set to 1 if `ans2` is '>', otherwise `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. If `ans1` is neither '<' nor '=', `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx` and `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**
