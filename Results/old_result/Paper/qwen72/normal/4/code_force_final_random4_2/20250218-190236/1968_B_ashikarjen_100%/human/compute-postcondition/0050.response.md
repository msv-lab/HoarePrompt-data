Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `n` and `m`, which are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function does not return any value.**
