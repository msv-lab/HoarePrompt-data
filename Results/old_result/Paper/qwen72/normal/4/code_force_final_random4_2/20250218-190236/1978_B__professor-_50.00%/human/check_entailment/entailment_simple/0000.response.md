Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would not be higher. The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is optimal to sell all `n` buns at the modified price. The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is the total profit from selling `n` buns at the modified price.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns at the usual price `a`. The formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of buns sold at the modified price and the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Correct Formula for Case 3**:
   - The correct formula should be:
     - `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a + 2) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a + 1)))`
   - This formula calculates the sum of the first `b - a + 1` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, and then adds the profit from the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `4 4 5`:
     - `b - a + 1 = 2`, so the modified price buns are sold for `5 + 4 = 9` coins.
     - The remaining `n - 2 = 2` buns are sold for `4 * 2 = 8` coins.
     - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17` coins. The program correctly outputs `17`.
   - For the test case `5 5 9`:
     - `b - a + 1 = 5`, so the modified price buns are sold for `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35` coins.
     - The program correctly outputs `35`.
   - For the test case `10 10 5`:
     - `b - a + 1 = 1`, so the modified price buns are sold for `5` coins.
     - The remaining `n - 1 = 9` buns are sold for `10 * 9 = 90` coins.
     - Total profit: `5 + 90 = 95` coins. The program incorrectly outputs `100`.

Given the incorrect formula in the third case, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
