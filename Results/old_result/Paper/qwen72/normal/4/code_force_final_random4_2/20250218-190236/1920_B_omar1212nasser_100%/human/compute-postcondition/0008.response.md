Output State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`, and the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to it.
- The initial state indicates that `s2` was previously updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`.
- After the code execution, `s2` is now `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`.
- The values of `removals`, `s`, `negatives`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements` still holds.
