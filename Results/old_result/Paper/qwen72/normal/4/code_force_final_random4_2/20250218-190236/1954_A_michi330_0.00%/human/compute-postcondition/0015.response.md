Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `itest` is 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- The condition is that if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is a simple statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides conditions that determine whether a certain condition is true or false, but it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` because the statement itself is not conditional.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
