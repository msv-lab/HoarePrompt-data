To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `high` and `cur`.

Given:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Since `cur` is set to `low`, the loop will execute if `high >= low`. This is always true because `high` is defined as the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is defined as the minimum of the same values. Therefore, `high` will always be greater than or equal to `low`.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
