Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `w` is the last element of the updated `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` is the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers.
- `n * m * mu` is the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `N`, `n`, `w`, `mu`) retain their values as described in the initial state.
