### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that the bitwise XOR of \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR operations between pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \( \text{ans1} \) such that \( p_{\text{ans1}} \) is the maximum element in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_0 \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( (p_0 \mid p_0) \) vs \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - Once \( \text{ans1} \) is found, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mx} \) such that \( p_{\text{mx}} \) maximizes the XOR with \( p_{\text{ans1}} \).
   - This is done by comparing \( (p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).

4. **Handling Ties:**
   - If multiple indices \( i \) have the same value of \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \), the program collects these indices in a list \( v \).
   - It then compares the elements in \( v \) to find the one that maximizes the XOR with \( p_{\text{ans1}} \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the indices \( \text{ans} \) and \( \text{ans1} \) as the final answer.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n):
         x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
         if x == '<':
             ans1 = i
     ```
   - This loop correctly finds the index \( \text{ans1} \) such that \( p_{\text{ans1}} \) is the maximum element in the permutation. This is because \( (p_i \mid p_i) = p_i \), and the maximum element will always be greater than or equal to any other element.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n):
         x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
         if x == '<':
             v = []
             mx = i
             v.append(i)
         elif x == '=':
             v.append(i)
     ```
   - This loop correctly identifies the indices \( i \) such that \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \) is equal to the maximum value found so far. The list \( v \) will contain all such indices.

3. **Resolving Ties:**
   - The loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, len(v)):
         x = func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])
         if x == '>':
             ans = v[i]
     ```
   - This loop correctly finds the index \( \text{ans} \) in \( v \) such that \( p_{\text{ans}} \) is the maximum element among the tied indices. This ensures that \( p_{\text{ans}} \oplus p_{\text{ans1}} \) is maximized.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The program uses \( n-1 \) queries to find \( \text{ans1} \).
   - It uses \( n-1 \) queries to find the list \( v \).
   - It uses \( |v|-1 \) queries to resolve ties, where \( |v| \) is the number of tied indices.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (|v|-1) \leq 3n-3 \), which is within the allowed limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, and it does so within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
