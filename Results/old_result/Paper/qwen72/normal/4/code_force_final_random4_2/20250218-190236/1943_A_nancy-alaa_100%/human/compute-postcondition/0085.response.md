Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 0, and `first` is False. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
