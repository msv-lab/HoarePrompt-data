### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Current Implementation of `func_15`**:
   - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where it increments `i` and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans` as long as \(i \le m\) and \(i * i \le n + i\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Analysis of the Loop**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) do not directly relate to the problem's requirement of \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop is iterating over `i` and treating `i` as `b`, but it does not correctly account for all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges.
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is not a valid way to determine if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. Instead, it performs a series of calculations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem description.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the function needs to be revised to correctly implement the problem's logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
