Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `k` is not 0, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[n-1]`.***
