### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is appropriate for the problem's input format.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is also correct for the permutation input.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == x`. This is necessary to determine where `x` is located in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the value at `arr[mid]`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search range is narrowed down to a single element.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the loop, it means the binary search would have found `x` correctly, and the program outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low] != x`, the program outputs `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is correct in the sense that it will narrow down the search range to a single element.
  - However, the binary search assumes the array is sorted, which is not the case here. The program is designed to handle the unsorted permutation by allowing up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - If `arr[low] != x` after the binary search, the program suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.
  - This swap ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

- **Handling Multiple Swaps:**
  - The problem description states that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the program only performs 1 swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - This might be a limitation, but the problem also states that 2 operations are always sufficient, and the program is not required to minimize the number of swaps. Therefore, performing a single swap is acceptable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
  - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by suggesting a single swap.

### Issues:

- **Binary Search Range Initialization:**
  - The original program initializes `high` to `n - 1`, which is correct for a 0-indexed array.
  - However, the problem description mentions `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, which suggests a 1-indexed array. This discrepancy is handled correctly in the program by using 0-indexing consistently.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, providing the number of swaps and the indices for the swaps.

### Conclusion:

- The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs a swap to ensure the binary search will find `x`. The program does not need to handle more than 1 swap in the given context, as it is not required to minimize the number of swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**

The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
