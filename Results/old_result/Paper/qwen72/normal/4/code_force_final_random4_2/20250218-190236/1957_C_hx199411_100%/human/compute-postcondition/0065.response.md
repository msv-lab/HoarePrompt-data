Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations. If `m` is 0, `m` is `n - k` regardless of whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. If `m` is 1, `m` is `n - k` if `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, otherwise `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers with the specified values if `m` is not 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `k` times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k-1`.
- For each iteration, the user provides two integers `c` and `r`.
- If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.
- After all `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of the increments based on the equality of `c` and `r` for each move.
- The variable `m` is determined based on the final value of `num` and the initial conditions:
  - If `m` is 0, it will be set to `n - k`.
  - If `m` is 1, it will be set to `n - k` if `c` was equal to `r` for all `k` moves, otherwise it will be set to `n - (2k - m)`.
- The list `dp` is only modified if `m` is not 1, and it will contain the specified values up to `dp[m]` based on the formula provided.
