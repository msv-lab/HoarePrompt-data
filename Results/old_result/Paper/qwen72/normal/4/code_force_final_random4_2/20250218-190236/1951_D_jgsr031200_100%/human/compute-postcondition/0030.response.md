Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \neq k\).
- \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Define `costs`**:
   - `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`

2. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - Let's denote the elements of `costs` as `costs[0]` and `costs[1]`.
   - `costs[0] = n - k + 1`
   - `costs[1] = 1`
   - The quotient of `n` divided by `costs[0]` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \).
   - The quotient of `n` divided by `costs[1]` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor = n \).
   - Therefore, `h` is:
     \[
     h = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n
     \]

3. **Update `n`**:
   - `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
   - The product of `costs[0]` and its quotient is:
     \[
     (n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - The product of `costs[1]` and its quotient is:
     \[
     1 \times n = n
     \]
   - The new `n` is:
     \[
     n = n - \left( (n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     (n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n
     \]
   - Let \( q = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \). Then:
     \[
     (n - k + 1) \times q + n
     \]
   - The remainder when `n` is divided by `n - k + 1` is:
     \[
     n \mod (n - k + 1)
     \]
   - Therefore, the new `n` is:
     \[
     n = n - \left( (n - k + 1) \times q + n \right) = n - (n - k + 1) \times q - n = - (n - k + 1) \times q
     \]
   - Since \( q \) is the quotient, it is a non-negative integer. The expression \( - (n - k + 1) \times q \) will always be non-positive, and since `n` is a positive integer, this implies that `n` will be set to 0 after the operation.

4. **Final State of `costs`**:
   - The `costs` list remains unchanged after the operations because the update to `n` does not affect the elements of `costs`.

### Output:
The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list, which are `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, n >= k, and n != k)**
