Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input minus `(n + 1) // 2`, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is `0`, `pow` is `1`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains the second integer input.
- `L` remains an empty list.
- `tot` remains `0` because `L` is still empty.
- `pow` remains `1` because `L` is still empty, and `2^0` is `1`.
- `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.
