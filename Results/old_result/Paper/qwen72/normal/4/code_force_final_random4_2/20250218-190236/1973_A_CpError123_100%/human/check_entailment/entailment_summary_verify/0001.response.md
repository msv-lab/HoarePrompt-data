### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and it prints `-1`.
   - This is correct because in every game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw) is always even. Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores `a + b`.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Understanding the Calculations:**
   - `x` represents the total number of games played, since each game awards 2 points.
   - `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores. This is because in the worst case, all games involving the two smallest scores could have ended in draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the scores are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given game rules.
   - For valid scores, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games or the sum of the two smallest scores.

6. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The function assumes that the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The calculation `x = (a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of games played.
   - The calculation `y = a + b` is also correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores.
   - The final output `min(x, y)` ensures that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games or the sum of the two smallest scores.

7. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0, which is even. `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so the output is `0`.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2, which is even. `x = 1` and `y = 1`, so the output is `1`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3, which is odd. The output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4, which is even. `x = 2` and `y = 2`, so the output is `2`.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9, which is odd. The output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12, which is even. `x = 6` and `y = 7`, so the output is `6`.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12, which is even. `x = 6` and `y = 2`, so the output is `2`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The function correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The calculations and conditions are consistent with the problem description.

Final: **True**
