Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, and the list at index `u` contains the integer `v` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 2, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 3`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so if it was initially `v - 2`, it is now `v - 3`.
- The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `_`, and `u` remain unchanged.
- The structure of `u2vs` remains the same, with the list at index `v` containing the integer `u` and the list at index `u` containing the integer `v`.
