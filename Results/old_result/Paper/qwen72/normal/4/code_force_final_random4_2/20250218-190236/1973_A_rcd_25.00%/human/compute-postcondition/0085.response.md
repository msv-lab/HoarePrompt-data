Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is true and `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` at any point, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and break. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` and the loop will print `p3`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times. The variable `_` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the input integers for the last iteration of the loop, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop will print `-1` and continue to the next iteration. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop will determine `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively. The loop will then iterate through values of `cur` from `low` to `high`. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and break. If the condition is never met, the loop will complete, and `cur` will be `high + 1`, and the loop will print `p3`.
