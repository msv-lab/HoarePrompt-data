Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n` with `visited[2]` being `True`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` and `coef0[2]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` and `coef1[2]` being 1, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes` plus 2, `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`, `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements.**

Explanation:
- The code `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the condition `c1 != 0`.
- If `c1` is not 0, `ok` becomes `True`.
- If `c1` is 0, `ok` remains `False`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
