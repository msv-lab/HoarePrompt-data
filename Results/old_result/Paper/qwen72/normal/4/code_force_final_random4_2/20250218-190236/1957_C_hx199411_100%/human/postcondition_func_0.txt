The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. It calculates the number of moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` and uses this to compute a value `m`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. If `m` is greater than 1, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` and prints the value of `dp[m]`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0.
