Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n - 3`, `suff[n - 1]` is `c[n - 1]`, `suff[n - 2]` is `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`, `suff[i]` is `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2] + c[n - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`.
- Given `i` is `n - 3`, `suff[i + 1]` is `suff[n - 2]`, which is `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.
- Therefore, `suff[i]` becomes `c[n - 1] + c[n - 2] + c[n - 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
