Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is (0 + n) // 2, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, and `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.**

The value of `r` is updated to `mid`, which is `(0 + n) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
