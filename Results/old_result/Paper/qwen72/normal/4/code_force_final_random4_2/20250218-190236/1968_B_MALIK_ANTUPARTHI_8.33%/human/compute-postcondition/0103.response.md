Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `a - 1`, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is the index where the loop was broken or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the last updated value of `k` based on the loop's execution.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, and the sum of all `n` and `m` values over all test cases remain unchanged.
- The loop runs `a` times, where `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a - 1`, as it increments from 0 to `a - 1`.
- For each iteration, `b` and `c` are integers greater than 0, and `d` and `e` are input strings.
- The variable `j` will be the index where the inner loop was broken, or it will be `b` if the inner loop completed without breaking.
- The variable `k` will be the last updated value based on the inner loop's execution, which could be the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the inner loop was broken.
