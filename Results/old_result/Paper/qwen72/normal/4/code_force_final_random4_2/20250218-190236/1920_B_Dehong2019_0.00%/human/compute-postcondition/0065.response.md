Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` minus `2 * a[j + x]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1` where `j + x < n`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations.**

The code snippet `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)` updates the list `a` to be a sorted list of integers in descending order, based on the input provided. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans` remain unchanged, but the list `a` now contains the sorted input integers.
