The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3. If `ans` is '<', `max_item_idx` is 2 and `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 2, 2)`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 0 and `ans` is not '<'.**
