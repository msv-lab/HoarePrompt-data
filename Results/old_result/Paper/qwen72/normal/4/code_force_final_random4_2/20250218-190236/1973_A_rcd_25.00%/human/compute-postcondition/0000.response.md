The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The constraints for `t` remain the same (1 <= t <= 500). The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected and still adhere to the initial constraints (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.**
