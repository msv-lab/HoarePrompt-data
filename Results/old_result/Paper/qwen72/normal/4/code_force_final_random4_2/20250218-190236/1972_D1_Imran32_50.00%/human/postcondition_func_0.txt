The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `n` is a positive integer. It then calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `n` and a series of terms derived from `n` and its square root. Specifically, `ans` is computed as `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each integer `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value.
