Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `target` is now assigned the value of `total_water` divided by `n` using integer division. This means `target` is the average value of the elements in the list `a`.
