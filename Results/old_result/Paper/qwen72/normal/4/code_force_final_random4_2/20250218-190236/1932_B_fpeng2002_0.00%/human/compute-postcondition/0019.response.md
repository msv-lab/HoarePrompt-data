The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is set to `len(nums) - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `x` should be initialized to 0, and `nums` must have at least 1 integer.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is 0**
