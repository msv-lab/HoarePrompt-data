Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= t), and `a` and `b` are integers. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`, and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` are not evaluated in this code snippet, so they remain unchanged if they were defined in the initial state.
- The initial state's conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` are still valid after the code has been executed.
