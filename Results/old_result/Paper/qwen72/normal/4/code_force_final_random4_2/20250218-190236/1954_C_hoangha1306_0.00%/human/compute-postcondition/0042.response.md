Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, and `i` is 1. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the second character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal), and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` (or `b` if they were equal) concatenated with the second character of `a`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then: if `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y` appended to its previous value; otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`, and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `x` concatenated to its previous value.***
