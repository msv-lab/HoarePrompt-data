Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the new input with the first two elements removed and the new first element must be 0, `i` is the length of the new `a` minus 1, `res` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed and the new first element must be 0.
- After executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of `a` (which was 0) is removed, so `a` now has the first two elements removed from the original input.
- The length of `a` is now reduced by 1, so `i` is the length of the new `a` minus 1.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
