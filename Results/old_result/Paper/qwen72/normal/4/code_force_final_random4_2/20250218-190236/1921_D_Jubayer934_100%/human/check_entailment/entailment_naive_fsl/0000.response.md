Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in array `b` is exactly equal to the number of elements in array `a`. In such cases, the program incorrectly uses `b[-(n - i)]` to access elements from the end of the array `b`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
The program will sort `a` to `[1, 2, 3]` and `b` to `[6, 5, 4]`. It will then calculate the differences as follows:
- `abs(1 - 6) = 5`
- `abs(2 - 5) = 3`
- `abs(3 - 4) = 1`

The total difference `D` will be `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.

However, the correct maximum difference `D` should be:
- `abs(1 - 4) = 3`
- `abs(2 - 5) = 3`
- `abs(3 - 6) = 3`

The total difference `D` should be `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, but the program does not guarantee that it will always find the optimal arrangement of elements in `b` to maximize `D`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it always uses the largest possible elements from `b` to maximize the difference, regardless of the length of `b`. The correct approach would be to sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, and then pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, the second smallest element of `a` with the second largest element of `b`, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
