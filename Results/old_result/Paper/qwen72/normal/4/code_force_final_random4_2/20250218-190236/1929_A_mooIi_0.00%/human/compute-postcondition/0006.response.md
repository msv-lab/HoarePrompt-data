Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 1, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than 1.**

The code `ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` updates the variable `ar` to be a map object that contains the string representations of the sorted integers from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged. The input is split into a list of integers, which is then sorted, and each integer is converted to a string. The resulting map object is assigned to `ar`.
