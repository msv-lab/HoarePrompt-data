Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
   - `i` is set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration.
   - The current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is set to 0, we are accessing the first elements of the lists `x` and `y`.
   - `x` is a list where each element is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`. Therefore, `x[0]` is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.
   - `y` is a list where each element is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`. Therefore, `y[0]` is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.
   - According to the precondition, `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `x[0]` and `y[0]` separated by a space.
   - Since `x[0]` is the integer value of the first element of `xylist` and `y[0]` is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, and `x[0]` is less than `y[0]`, the output will be the specific values of these elements.

Output: **x[0] y[0] (where x[0] is the integer value of the first element of `xylist` and y[0] is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, and x[0] < y[0])**
