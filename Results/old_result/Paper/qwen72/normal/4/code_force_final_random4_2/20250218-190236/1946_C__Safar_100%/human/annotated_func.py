#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least `k` tuples, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least `k` tuples, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1` if `check(l)` is true, or `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false if `check(l)` is false.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: - The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, and the function `check` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `r` in terms of the conditions given:
    #
    #- If `check(l)` is true, then `r` will be `l - 1`.
    #- If `check(l)` is false, then `r` will be the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.
    #
    #Therefore, the output will be:
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that the function `check` returns `False` for `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`. The function does not return any value.
