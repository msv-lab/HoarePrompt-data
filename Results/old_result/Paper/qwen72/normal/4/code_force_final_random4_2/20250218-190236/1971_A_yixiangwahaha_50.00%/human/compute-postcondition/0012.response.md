Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` twice, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` twice, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` updates the value of `xylist` to be a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces.
- The initial state already specifies that `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces, so this part of the state remains unchanged.
- The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the explicit confirmation that `xylist` is now a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces.
