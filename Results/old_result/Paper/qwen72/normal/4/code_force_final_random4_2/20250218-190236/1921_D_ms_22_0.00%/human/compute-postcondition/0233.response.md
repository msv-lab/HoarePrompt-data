Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]` based on future conditions, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is now `tp1 + 1`, `tp2` is an index in the list `b`, and if `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` or `tp2` will be adjusted based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
