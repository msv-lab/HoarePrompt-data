Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.
- `first` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
2. **Variable `first`**: The variable `first` is set to False in the initial state.
3. **Counter `mpp`**: The Counter object `mpp` contains the frequency count of each integer in the list `arr`. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `mpp` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.
4. **Condition Check**:
   - The code snippet checks if `i` is in `mpp.keys()`.
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the loop or if statement is broken.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Execution:
- The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state, the value of `i` is 1.

### Output:
Output: **1**
