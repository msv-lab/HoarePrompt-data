Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the values (s - 2 * n), (s - 2 * n), and (s - 2 * n) appended, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the previous value of `n` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value `(s - 2 * n)` is appended to the list `pos`.
- The list `pos` now contains the values `(s - 2 * n)`, `(s - 2 * n)`, and the newly appended `(s - 2 * n)`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `s`, and `n`) remain as they were, with `n` potentially updated based on the conditions provided.
