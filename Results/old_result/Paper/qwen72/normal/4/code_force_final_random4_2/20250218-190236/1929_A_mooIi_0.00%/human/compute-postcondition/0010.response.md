Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 2, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet updates the `ar` variable to be a map object that contains the string representations of the sorted integers from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged. The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
