Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the grid. The function should output "YES" or "NO" for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for the last test case, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `i` is `n-1`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions: if the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, or if the first row is composed of the same character repeated and this character is different from the character in the last row, then "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by examining the first and last rows and the first and last characters of the grid. If the first row or the first column contains only one unique character and this character is different from the corresponding character in the last row or last column, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` as described in the annotated code.
