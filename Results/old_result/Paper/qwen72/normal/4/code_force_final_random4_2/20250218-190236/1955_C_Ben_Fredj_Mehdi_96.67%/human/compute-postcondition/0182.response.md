An exception in the provided `try` block could occur at the following points:
1. When converting `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer using `int(a[g])` or `int(a[d])`. This might fail if the value at these indices is not a valid integer.
2. When decrementing the value at `a[g]` or `a[d]` by 1. This might fail if the value at these indices is not an integer or if the index is out of bounds (e.g., if `g` or `d` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`).

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs during these operations, the `except` block will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least `2 * (i + 2)`, `i` is `i + 2`. If no exception occurs, the value at index `d` in the list `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, and if `a[d]` was 0, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2 or minus 3 (depending on whether `a[d]` was 0). If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
