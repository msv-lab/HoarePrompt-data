Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1, and then this result is added to the original value of `k`.
- The original value of `k` was 0 if `d[j-1]` (which is `d[0]`) was not in `e[k:]` or the index of the first occurrence of `d[j-1]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 if `d[j-1]` was in `e[k:]`.
- Since `j` is 1, `d[j]` is `d[1]`.
- The new value of `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in `e[k:]` plus 1, and then this result is added to the original value of `k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
