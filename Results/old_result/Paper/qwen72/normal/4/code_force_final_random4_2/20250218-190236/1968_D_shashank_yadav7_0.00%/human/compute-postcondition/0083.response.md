The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is assigned the value `p[b] - 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then `bm` is further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.**
