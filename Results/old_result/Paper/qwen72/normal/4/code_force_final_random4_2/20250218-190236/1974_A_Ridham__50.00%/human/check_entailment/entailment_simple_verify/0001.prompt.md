You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`.
   - The combined total space required is `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The function calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (as 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and a screen has 15 cells), the calculation is:
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Cells:**
   - If the space required for 1x1 icons `space_x` is less than or equal to the remaining cells `remaining_cells`, then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
  - The calculation for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, so the formula `y // 2` for even `y` and `y // 2 + 1` for odd `y` is accurate.

- **Correctness of Remaining Cells Calculation:**
  - The calculation for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. The formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` correctly determines the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icons Placement:**
  - The function correctly checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells. If they can, it uses the same number of screens. If they cannot, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- **Output:**
  - The function correctly appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

### Correctness:
**True**
