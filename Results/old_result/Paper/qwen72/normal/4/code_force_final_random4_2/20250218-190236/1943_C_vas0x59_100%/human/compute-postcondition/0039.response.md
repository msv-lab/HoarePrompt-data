Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes from the `bfs` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values of `b`, `n`, and `n` (the last value being the appended `n`), `_` remains `n - 2`, `u` remains `u - (n - 1)`, `v` remains `v - (n - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
