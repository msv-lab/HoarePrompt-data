Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`).
   - `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`).
   - `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.
   - Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The value `1` is a constant integer.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, or `st`.

Output: **1**
