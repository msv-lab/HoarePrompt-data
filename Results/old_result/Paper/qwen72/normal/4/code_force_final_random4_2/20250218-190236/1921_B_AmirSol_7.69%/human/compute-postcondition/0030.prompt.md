Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1, and the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is different from `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is 2, the characters at index `i - 2` in `s1` and `s2` are different, and the character at index `i - 2` in `s1` is different from the character at index `i - 1` in `s1`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `s1[i]` is the same as `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 0, `i` is 1, and the characters at index `i-1` in `s1` and `s2` are the same.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i]` != `s2[i]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `i` < `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` != `s2[i + 1]` and (`s1[i]` != `s1[i + 1]`), then `i` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i]` == `s2[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is increased by 1, and `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `i` was less than `n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` was not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` was not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
