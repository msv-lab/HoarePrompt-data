Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `not_mid` must be greater than 1, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` is assigned the value `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is now assigned the value `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`.**

The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` assigns the value `clique` to the element at the index `left + mid + i` in the `cliquess` list. Since `i` is 1, the index `left + mid + 1` is updated to `clique`. All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
