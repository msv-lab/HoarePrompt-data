Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.**

The code snippet `zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]` assigns the value `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suffZero[-1]` is the last element of the list `suffZero`, and `zeroInd` is twice this value.
