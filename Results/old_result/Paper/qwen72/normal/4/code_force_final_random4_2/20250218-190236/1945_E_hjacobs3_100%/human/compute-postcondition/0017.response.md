Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r` is now `mid`, `r - l` must be greater than 1.**

The value of `r` is updated to be `mid`, which is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
