The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, `i` is already less than `n`. Therefore, the loop condition `i < n` is satisfied, and no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
