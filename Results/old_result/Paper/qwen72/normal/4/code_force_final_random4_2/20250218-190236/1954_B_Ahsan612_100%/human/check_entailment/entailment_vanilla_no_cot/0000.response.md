Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the logic for identifying the minimum segment of consecutive identical elements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the array and count consecutive identical elements.
   - However, the logic for updating `i` and `num` is flawed. The line `i += 1` is executed twice in some cases, which can skip elements and lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Segment**:
   - The program updates `minn` with the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found.
   - This approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the shortest segment of consecutive identical elements, which is not necessarily the correct solution.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same (`minn == len(ar)`), but it does not correctly handle other edge cases, such as arrays with a single element or arrays that are already non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no segment of the array allows the operation to be applied. This involves checking for the smallest segment where the operation can be applied and ensuring that removing elements from this segment makes the array non-beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        minn = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)
        
        # If no such segment is found, the array is already non-beautiful
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check for All Identical Elements**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, so we print `-1`.

2. **Find Minimum Elements to Remove**:
   - Iterate through the array and check for segments where `a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]`.
   - If such a segment is found, the minimum number of elements to remove is `1` (the middle element of the segment).

3. **Handle No Segments**:
   - If no such segment is found, the array is already non-beautiful, so we print `-1`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
