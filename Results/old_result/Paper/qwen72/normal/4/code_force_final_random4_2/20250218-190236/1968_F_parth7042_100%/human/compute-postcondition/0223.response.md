Output State: **_ is q, index is 7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n + 2*q, results is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length q.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `q` iterations, the following changes occur to the variables involved in the loop:

1. **_ (Loop Counter)**: The loop counter `_` will be equal to `q`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
2. **index**: The `index` variable, which is used to access the `data` list for the values of `l` and `r`, will have been incremented by `2 * q` (since `index` is incremented by 2 in each iteration). Therefore, the final value of `index` will be `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n + 2*q`.
3. **results**: The `results` list will contain `q` elements, each of which is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop.

All other variables that were not modified within the loop (such as `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `n`, and `q`) will retain their initial values.
