You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input by the user. For each iteration, `L` and `M` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of sale days, `m` is the minimum of the maximum tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought, `k` is the number of tickets to be bought, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`. If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, the last element `w` is removed from `N`, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and the cost is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `cost` for each test case is printed, and the loop continues to the next iteration until all `t` iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of sale days `n`, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each day. It returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
