Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^6 for all i in the range 0 <= i < len(a).
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `a` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^6 for all i in the range 0 <= i < len(a). `n` is equal to the length of `a`. `sorted_a` is a sorted version of `a` in ascending order. `concatenated_a` is a list that contains the elements of `a` repeated twice. `i` is equal to `n`. If any subsequence `concatenated_a[j:j + len(sorted_a)]` for 0 <= j < n is equal to `sorted_a`, the program returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'Yes' and the loop completes without finding such a subsequence.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers (with the constraints 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 1,000,000). It checks if any subsequence of the list `a` repeated twice (i.e., `a + a`) is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 * t + 1 + t * n`, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)` in the last iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result_1]\n[result_2]\n...\n[result_t] (where each result_i is the value returned by func_1(a) in the i-th iteration of the loop, and t is the number of iterations)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from standard input, processes them, and prints the results of calling `func_1` on each of the input lists. Specifically, it expects the first input to be an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1(a)` for each test case, one result per line. The function does not return any value.
