Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state specifies that `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'. These conditions remain unchanged. The value of `q + r` is computed and then the modulus operation with `n` is applied, and the result is added to `temp`. Therefore, `temp` now contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
