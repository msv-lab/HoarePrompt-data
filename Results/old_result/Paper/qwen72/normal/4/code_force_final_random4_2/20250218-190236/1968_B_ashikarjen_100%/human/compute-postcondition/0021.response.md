Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `j` must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The new value of `j` is `j + 1`, and it still must be less than `m`. The conditions that `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]` and `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]` are still valid.
