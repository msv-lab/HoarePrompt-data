The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function also implicitly uses a global variable `graph` (a dictionary or list of lists where each entry represents the adjacency list of a vertex) and a global variable `vis` (a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph and checks if the vertex has been visited. If the vertex has not been visited, it marks the vertex as visited and returns the list of adjacent vertices from the graph. If the vertex has already been visited, it returns an empty list.**
