Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement.

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in the list `a`.
2. **`a`**: `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. **`x`**: `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. **`inds`**: `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. Each key in `inds` is an element of `x`, and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
5. **`q`**: `q` is greater than 1.
6. **`i`**: `i` is 1.
7. **`l` and `r`**: `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. **`lower`**: `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
9. **`upper`**: `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.
10. **Condition**: If `upper` > `lower`, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` > `lower`. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` â‰¤ `lower`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Yes')` statement will always print the string `'Yes'`.
- The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. They are used to determine the flow of the program, but the `print` statement itself is unconditional and will always execute.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
