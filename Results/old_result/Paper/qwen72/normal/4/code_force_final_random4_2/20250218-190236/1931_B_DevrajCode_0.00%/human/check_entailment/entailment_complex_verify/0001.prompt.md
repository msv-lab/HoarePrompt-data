You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, and the loop has executed `n` times.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that each element becomes equal to the average of the elements in `a` (i.e., `total_water // n`). If at any point during the redistribution process, the cumulative difference between the elements and the target value becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the redistribution can be completed without any negative cumulative differences, the function returns 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `n` from the first element of the list.
   - The rest of the elements in the list are the water amounts for all containers across all test cases.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases separately. It only processes the first test case and then calls `func_1` with the total number of elements and the entire list of water amounts. This is incorrect because each test case should be processed independently.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - The function iterates through the water amounts and keeps a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it returns 'No' because it means it is impossible to balance the water without violating the condition \( i < j \).
   - If the loop completes without the running total becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic within `func_1` is correct for a single test case. It correctly checks if the water can be balanced by ensuring that the running total of the differences does not become negative.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It should parse each test case separately and call `func_1` for each one.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It processes all input as a single test case, which is not the intended behavior. The function `func_1` itself is logically correct for a single test case, but the overall program structure is flawed.
