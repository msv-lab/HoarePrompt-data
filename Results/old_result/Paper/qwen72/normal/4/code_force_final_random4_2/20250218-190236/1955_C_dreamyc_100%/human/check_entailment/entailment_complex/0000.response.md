Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining how many ships are sunk after the Kraken attacks them a certain number of times, following a specific pattern of attacking the first and last ships alternately. The function `func_1` is designed to handle this task. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Initial Check for Total Durability**:
   - The function first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities (`sum(nums)`). If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will be sunk. This is correct because if the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships, all ships will indeed sink.

2. **Calculating Attack Cycles**:
   - The program then calculates `a` and `b` as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively. These values represent the number of attacks on the first and last ships in a cycle. This is a correct approach because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, and the total number of attacks is split into two parts.

3. **Loop to Simulate Attacks**:
   - The loop iterates over each ship, updating the cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` for the first and last ships, respectively.
   - For each ship, it checks if `s_a` (cumulative sum of attacks on the first ship) is less than or equal to `a` and if `s_b` (cumulative sum of attacks on the last ship) is less than or equal to `b`. If either condition is true, it increments the `ans` counter.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks. The program should keep track of which ships are still in the list and update their durabilities accordingly, removing them from the list when they sink.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is supposed to be the number of ships sunk. However, due to the flawed logic in the loop, `ans` does not accurately represent the number of ships sunk.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Use a deque to efficiently remove ships from the front and back.
- Simulate the attacks by alternating between the first and last ships, reducing their durability, and removing them from the deque when their durability reaches zero.
- Count the number of ships removed from the deque.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk_ships = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
                sunk_ships += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships and ships[-1] > 0:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk_ships += 1
            k -= 1
    
    return sunk_ships
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and does not accurately count the number of ships sunk. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
