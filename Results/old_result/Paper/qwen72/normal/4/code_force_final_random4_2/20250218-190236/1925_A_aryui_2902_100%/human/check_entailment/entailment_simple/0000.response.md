Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. However, the current implementation simply repeats the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times. This approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets are: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`. The program generates the string `abcabc`, which indeed contains all these subsequences, but it does not necessarily generate the shortest possible string that contains all these subsequences.

A correct approach would involve generating a string that is the concatenation of all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` characters, but this would be very inefficient for larger values of `n` and `k`. A more efficient approach would be to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length exactly once.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), the current implementation does not always produce the correct output, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

Correctness: **False**
