The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
