Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling for Test Cases**: The program reads a single integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. However, it then proceeds to read exactly 10 lines of input, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should be determined by the value of `t`.

2. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the minimum and maximum values with an extra space between the numbers and the separating space. This is not necessary and can be simplified.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Loop for the number of test cases
        x, y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the two integers
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program reads the correct number of test cases and formats the output correctly.
