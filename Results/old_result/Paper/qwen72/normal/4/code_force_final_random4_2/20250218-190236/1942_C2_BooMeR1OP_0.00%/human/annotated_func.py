#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of sides of the polygon (n), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x), the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y), and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where t is the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, and chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is still assigned the value from the input, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the condition `((a[i] + 1) % n) not in present and ((a[i] + 2) % n) in present` was true for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing the values of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1` where `gap` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` for the last iteration, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[x - 1] - 1` for the last iteration.
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y

    #State: `a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1` where `gap` is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, and `y` is the remaining value after all iterations.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final value after all iterations involving the variables and objects described in the initial state)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. It processes these inputs to calculate and print the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the polygon with `n` sides, given the vertices Bessie has already chosen. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
