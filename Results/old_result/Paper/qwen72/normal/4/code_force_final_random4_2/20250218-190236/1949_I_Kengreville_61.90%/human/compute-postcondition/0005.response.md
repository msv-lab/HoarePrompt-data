Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `nodes` is a list that includes `i` at the end, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of numbers of length n, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`**

Explanation:
- `dy` is assigned the value of `y[i] - y[j]`.
- Since `j` is 0, `dy` becomes `y[i] - y[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
