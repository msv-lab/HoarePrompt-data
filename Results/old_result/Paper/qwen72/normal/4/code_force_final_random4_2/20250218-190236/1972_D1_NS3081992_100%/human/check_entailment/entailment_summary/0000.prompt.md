Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer value from the standard input and returns this integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object that converts each string in the input line into an integer. The map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns a list of integers. The function does not take any parameters. After the function call, the list of integers is available for further use, and the standard input stream is advanced to the next line.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns a list containing the results of `func_3()` called `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting line.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, decodes the bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of integers derived from the input provided.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of calling the function `func_7()`. The final state of the program is that it has a list containing `rows` number of results from `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns a value provided by the user through the `input` function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a string input by the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user through input. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which is the user's input converted to an integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input has been processed and returned as a list of substrings.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers (each element is either 0 or 1), a positive integer `da`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list `d[da]` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over each element in `d[da]`, and for each element `di` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, it sets `processing[di - 1]` to 1, recursively calls `func_12` with updated parameters, and then resets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. The function updates `rank[da - 1]` to be 1 more than the minimum value returned by these recursive calls. Finally, the function returns the updated value of `rank[da - 1]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. It returns a tuple of three values: the first value is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b`, and the second and third values are coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively computes the GCD and the coefficients.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference (`m` - `a[i]`). After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. The final state of the program includes the updated value of `k` and the return value of either 1 or -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It updates the values of `n` and `m` to the return values of `func_7()`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function then calculates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer `k` such that `k * k > n + k` or `k > m`. Finally, it returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the calculated sum.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10`. For each iteration, it prints the integer returned by `func_15` to the console, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the number of valid pairs for each test case (as determined by `func_15`) has been printed to the console, and the program state is unchanged except for the side effect of the console output.
