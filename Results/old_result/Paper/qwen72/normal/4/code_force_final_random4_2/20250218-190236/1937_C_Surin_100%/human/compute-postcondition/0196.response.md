Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string, `prev` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`.
- Since `i` is 2, `prev` is now 2.
- The values of `R`, `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged.
- The condition for setting `prev` based on the values of `r` and `r2` is not affected by this code, so the initial conditions for `r` and `r2` still apply.
- The output buffer being flushed remains unchanged.
