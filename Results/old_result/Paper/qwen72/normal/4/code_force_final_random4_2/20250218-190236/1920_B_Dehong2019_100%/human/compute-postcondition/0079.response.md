Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 0, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the value of `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.
- The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans2` is the maximum of the two values `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.
