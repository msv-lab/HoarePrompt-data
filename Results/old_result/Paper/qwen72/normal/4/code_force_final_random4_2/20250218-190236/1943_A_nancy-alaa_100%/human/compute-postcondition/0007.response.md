Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is False.
- The current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`. According to the precondition, `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, which means `i` is an integer that is not present in the list `arr`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **i (where i is an integer not present in the list `arr`)**
