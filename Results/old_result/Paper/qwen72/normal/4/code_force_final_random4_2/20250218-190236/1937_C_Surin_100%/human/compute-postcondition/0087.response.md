Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `v2` is explicitly defined as 2.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string where the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` are replaced with their respective values.

So, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
