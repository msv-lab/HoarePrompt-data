Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `i` is 4, `num` is the third integer in `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, `minn` was initially `inf` and `same` is 2. The minimum of `inf` and 2 is 2, but since `minn` is updated to 1 in the initial state, it remains 1.
- If `ar[1]` is not equal to the first integer in `ar`, `minn` was initially 1 and `same` is 1. The minimum of 1 and 1 is 1, so `minn` remains 1.
- Therefore, in both cases, `minn` is 1 after the code execution.
