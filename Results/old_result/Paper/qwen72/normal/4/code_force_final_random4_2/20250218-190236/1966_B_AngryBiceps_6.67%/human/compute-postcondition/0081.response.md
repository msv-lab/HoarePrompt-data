Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for the last test case, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `i` is `n-1`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions: if the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, or if the first row is composed of the same character repeated and this character is different from the character in the last row, then "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, and `a` will be a list of `n` strings representing the grid for the last test case. The `first_row` and `last_row` will be strings composed of the first and last characters of each string in `a` for the last test case, respectively. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating the last row of the grid was processed. For each test case, the function has evaluated the conditions and printed "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
