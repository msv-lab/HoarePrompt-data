You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where 0 <= `times` <= len(arr)). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`, where `l` is the length of `arr`. This means it calculates the difference between the last element and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`. If `times` is 0, it returns the difference between the last element and itself (which is 0). If `times` is greater than 0, it returns the difference between the last element and the element `times` positions before the last element.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string and computes a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific calculation based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements updated, and this list is printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for placing the pinball on the i-th cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to calculate the cumulative effect of movements and inversions.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters from the end.
     - `ans` is the list to store the results for each query.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and updates `preOne` and `totalOne`.
     - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums.
     - Finally, it prints the results for each query.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid for each cell is based on the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The function correctly handles the inversion of the characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `accumulate` and the cumulative sums ensures that the time complexity is efficient, which is crucial given the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle cases where the string is entirely '<' or '>'.
   - It should also handle the case where the string has a mix of '<' and '>'.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by using the cumulative sums and the logic to calculate the time to leave the grid.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the results for each query in a single line.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters correctly.

Correctness: **True**
