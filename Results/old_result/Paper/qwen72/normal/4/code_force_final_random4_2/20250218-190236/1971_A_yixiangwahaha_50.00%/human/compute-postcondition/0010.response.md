Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` twice, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` twice, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the integer value of the second element of `xylist` to the list `y` again. Therefore, `y` now contains the integer value of the second element of `xylist` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
