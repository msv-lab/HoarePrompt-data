An exception in the given `try` block could occur at the points where the program attempts to access or modify the elements of the list `a` using the indices `g` and `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the bounds of the list `a` (i.e., they are negative or greater than or equal to the length of `a`), an `IndexError` would be raised. Additionally, if the elements at indices `g` or `d` are not integers, a `ValueError` might be raised when attempting to convert them to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the integers at the specified indices `g` and `d` by 1. If the value at index `g` or `d` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. If any exception occurs, the `except` block is triggered, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If no exception occurs, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
