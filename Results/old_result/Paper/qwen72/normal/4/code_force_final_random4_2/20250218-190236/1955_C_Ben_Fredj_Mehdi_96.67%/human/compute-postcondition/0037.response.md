Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 1999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 9999999999.
- `n` is not equal to 101 or `k` is not equal to 100000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 199999999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 1000000000000.
- `k` is currently equal to 200000000000.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('200')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'200'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
