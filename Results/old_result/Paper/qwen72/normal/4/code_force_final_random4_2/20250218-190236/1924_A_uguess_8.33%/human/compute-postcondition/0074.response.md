Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `cnt` being 1 and `cur` being 0 is not affected by this code snippet, so `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` is updated as described.
