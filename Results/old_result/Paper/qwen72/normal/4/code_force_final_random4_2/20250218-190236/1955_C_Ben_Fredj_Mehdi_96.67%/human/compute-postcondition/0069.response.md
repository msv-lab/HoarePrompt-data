The code snippet `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` modifies the list `a` by decrementing the integer at index `g` by 1. The variable `g` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it is a valid index in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, the integer at index `g` in `a` is now `int(a[g]) - 1`, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**.
