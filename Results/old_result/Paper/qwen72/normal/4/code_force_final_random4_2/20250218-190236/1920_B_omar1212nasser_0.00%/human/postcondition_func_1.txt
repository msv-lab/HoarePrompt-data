The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, where each value in `pos` is calculated as the sum of all integers in `elements` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`, adjusted for the removal of the last `removals` integers. The final state of the program is that `elements` remains unchanged, `removals` and `negatives` retain their original values, and a new list `pos` is created containing the calculated values.
