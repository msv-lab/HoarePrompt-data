Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `graph[ver]` has been fully processed. For each element `node` in `graph[ver]`, if `vis[node]` was initially `False`, it is now `True`, and `node` has been appended to `q`. If `vis[node]` was initially `True`, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`. The list `q` now contains all the unvisited neighbors of `ver` that were processed during the loop, in the order they were appended.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop has checked every neighbor of the node `ver` in the graph.
- Any neighbor that was not visited (i.e., `vis[node]` was `False`) has been marked as visited (`vis[node]` is now `True`) and added to the queue `q`.
- Any neighbor that was already visited (i.e., `vis[node]` was `True`) remains unvisited and is not added to the queue `q`.
- The queue `q` now includes all the unvisited neighbors of `ver` that were found during the loop, in the order they were processed.
