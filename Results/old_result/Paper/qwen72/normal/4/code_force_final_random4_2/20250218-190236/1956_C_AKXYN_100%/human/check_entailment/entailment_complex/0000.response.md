Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: The matrix `mat` is initialized as an n√ón matrix where each row contains the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is not strictly necessary for the solution but is a valid step.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum of the matrix can be maximized by filling it with the largest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to n. The formula correctly computes the sum of all elements in the matrix if each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
4. **Output of Operations**: The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `2 * n` (which is `n << 1`). It then prints the operations in the required format, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations for each row and column. This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum.
5. **Operation Validity**: The operations are valid as they follow the constraints of the problem. Each operation is either a type 1 or type 2 operation, and the permutations used are valid (i.e., they contain all integers from 1 to n).
6. **Number of Operations**: The number of operations is `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit of `2 * n`.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem and meets all the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
