The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition that `j` must be less than `b` remains unchanged, so `b` is still an integer greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 1, `k` is 0.**
