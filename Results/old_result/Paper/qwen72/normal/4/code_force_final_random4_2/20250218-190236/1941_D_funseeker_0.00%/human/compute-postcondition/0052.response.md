The only object in the loop head is the variable `q` and the collection `ans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans` collection. If `ans` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`, and `temp` is an empty set, which means `ans` could be empty. To ensure the loop executes, `ans` must contain at least one element.

State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`**
