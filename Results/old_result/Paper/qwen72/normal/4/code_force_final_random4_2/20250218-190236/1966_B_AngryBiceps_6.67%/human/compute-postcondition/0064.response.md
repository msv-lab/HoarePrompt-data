Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value in `a`, `i` is 1, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a`**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(input())` adds a new input value to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contains one input value.
- After executing the code, `a` now contains two input values.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged.
- `first_row` and `last_row` still refer to the first and last characters of the first input value in `a`, respectively.
