Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation array using a binary search approach, with the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. However, the implementation of `func_1` in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is implemented correctly in terms of the loop and the midpoint calculation. However, the initial values of `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n`, respectively, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `l = 0` and `r = n` (or `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` if using 1-based indexing).

2. **Output of Swaps**: The function `func_1` is supposed to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, it only prints the number of swaps (either "0" or "1") and returns the indices as a list of strings. This is inconsistent with the problem's requirement to output the number of swaps on the first line and the swap indices on subsequent lines.

3. **Logic for Swapping**: The logic for determining whether a swap is needed is incorrect. The function checks if `l` (the index found by binary search) is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. This check is flawed because `l` might not be the correct position even if `array[l] == find`. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the binary search can correctly identify the position of `x` by potentially swapping elements to make the array partially sorted.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases, but the function `func_1` should return the number of swaps and the swap indices in a consistent format that can be printed correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
