You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where each list has length n. For each i in range(n), x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False, 0, and 1 respectively. nodes is an empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` remains an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, otherwise it remains `False`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef0[i]` is 0 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef1[i]` is 1 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements, and it will be populated with indices that were visited during the loop. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`. `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, otherwise it remains `False`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef0[i]` is 0 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef1[i]` is 1 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `nodes` is a list that contains indices that were visited during the loop. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`. If `ok` is `True`, then `c1` is not 0. If `ok` is `False`, then `c1` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the coordinates and radii of n disks, where n is an integer between 1 and 1000. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to `False`, `0`, and `1` respectively, and `nodes` is an empty list. The function returns a value based on the manipulation of these lists, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
