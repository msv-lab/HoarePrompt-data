The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'1000'`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **1000**
