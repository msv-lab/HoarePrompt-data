Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cur` is 0.
- The code snippet `cur = 0` does not change the value of `cur` from its initial state.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
