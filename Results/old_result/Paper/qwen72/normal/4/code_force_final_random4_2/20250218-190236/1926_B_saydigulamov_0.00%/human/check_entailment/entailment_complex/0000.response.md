Reasoning:

The provided function `func` is intended to determine whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square based on the pattern of '1's. However, the function has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Output**: The function prints the list `k` when the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is not the correct output format. According to the problem description, the function should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The function only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is not sufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should form a specific pattern (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

3. **State Variables**: The state variables `a`, `i`, and `k` are not correctly described in the comments. After the function concludes, `a` should be the number of test cases, `i` should be the last index of the loop (not 0), and `k` should be a list of counts for the current test case, not across all iterations.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The function does not handle each test case independently. The list `k` accumulates counts across all test cases, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
