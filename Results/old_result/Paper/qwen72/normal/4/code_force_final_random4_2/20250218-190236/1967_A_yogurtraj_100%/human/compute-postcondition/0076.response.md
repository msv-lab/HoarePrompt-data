Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 2, and `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, this becomes `k -= 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- The values of `ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `k` is now `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
