Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` and `c` are input integers.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.

### Conditions:
- If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).
- If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state and conditions provided do not affect the `print` statement in any way. They are simply describing the state of the variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output: **YES**
