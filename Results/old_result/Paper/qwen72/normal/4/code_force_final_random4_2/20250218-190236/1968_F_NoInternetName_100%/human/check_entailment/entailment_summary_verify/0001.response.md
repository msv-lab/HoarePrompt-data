### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - This can be simplified by checking if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are helper functions that perform binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match, respectively.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes".
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is zero by directly printing "Yes".
   - It also handles the case where the XOR is not zero by using binary search to check for matching indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient because it precomputes the prefix XOR array and uses binary search to handle queries, which is \( O(\log n) \) per query.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n + q \log n) \), which is suitable given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of Function 5:

- **Prefix XOR Array Construction**:
  - The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed correctly by iterating through the array `a` and computing the cumulative XOR.
  - The dictionary `inds` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears, which is essential for the binary search.

- **Query Handling**:
  - For each query, the program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it prints "Yes" because the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
  - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses binary search to find the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` and the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
  - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes" because it means there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Binary Search Implementation**:
  - The binary search functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to find the indices in the `inds` dictionary.
  - `func_4` finds the largest index less than `l` where the prefix XOR value matches `x[r]`.
  - `func_3` finds the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR value matches `x[l-1]`.
  - The logic for these functions appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Correctness of XOR Check**:
  - The initial check `if x[l-1] == x[r]` is correct because it directly checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
  - The subsequent binary search logic is also correct because it ensures that there are indices within the range where the prefix XOR values match, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases. The binary search functions and the prefix XOR array are used appropriately to ensure the correct behavior for each query.

Final: **True**
