Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n - 2`, and `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a non-negative integer.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` will be `5 - 2 = 3`.

2. **Format the String**:
   - The `print` statement uses the format `'1 %d' % i`, which will replace `%d` with the value of `i`.
   - For example, if `i` is 3, the formatted string will be `'1 3'`.

3. **Generate the Range**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the range will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Unpack the Range**:
   - The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range, so each element in the range is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the `print` function will receive the arguments `'1 3'`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.

5. **Print the Output**:
   - The `print` function will print the formatted string followed by the unpacked range elements, separated by spaces.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be `1 3 1 2 3 4 5`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1 i'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `i` is `n - 2`.

Output: **1 [i] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [i] is the value of `n - 2` and [n] is the value of `n`)**
