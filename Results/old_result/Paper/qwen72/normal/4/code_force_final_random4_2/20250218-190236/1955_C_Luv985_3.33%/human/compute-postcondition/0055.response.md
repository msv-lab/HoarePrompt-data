Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is now `l + 1`, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is now `ans + 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `k` is now `k - (mi * 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
