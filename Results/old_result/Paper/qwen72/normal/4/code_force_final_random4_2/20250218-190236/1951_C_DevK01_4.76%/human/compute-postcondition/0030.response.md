Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`.
- `k` is equal to the third element of `L`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `n` is the number of elements in `N`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`) remain unchanged.
