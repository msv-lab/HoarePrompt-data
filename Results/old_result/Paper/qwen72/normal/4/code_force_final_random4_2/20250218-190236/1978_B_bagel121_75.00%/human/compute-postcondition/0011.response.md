The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(t)` loop. This loop will execute `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time the loop iterates. Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop's continuation, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `n`. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is the integer value of `(n - k) * a`. `t` is now `t - 1`.**
