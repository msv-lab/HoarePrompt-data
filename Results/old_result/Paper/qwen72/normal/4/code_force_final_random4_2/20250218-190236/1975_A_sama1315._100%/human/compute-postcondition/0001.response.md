Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a string from the input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
