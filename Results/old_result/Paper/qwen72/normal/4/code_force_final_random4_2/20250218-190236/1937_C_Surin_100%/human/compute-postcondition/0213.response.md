Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is the final value of `n`.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
   - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - The value of `prev` depends on the input string `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `n-1`.
     - If `r` is '=', then `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', then `prev` is `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `prev` is 0.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `n-1`.
   - **Scenario 2:** If `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', then `prev` is `n-1`.
   - **Scenario 3:** If `r` is anything other than '>' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is anything other than '<', then `prev` is 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - In all scenarios where `prev` is `n-1`, the output will be:
     ```python
     f'! {n-1} {n-1}'
     ```
   - In the scenario where `prev` is 0, the output will be:
     ```python
     f'! 0 {n-1}'
     ```

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `r` is '>' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', the output will be:
     Output: **! n-1 n-1 (where n is the final value of n)**
   - Otherwise, the output will be:
     Output: **! 0 n-1 (where n is the final value of n)**

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we use the variable `n` in the output. The final output will depend on the value of `r` and `r2` as described above.
