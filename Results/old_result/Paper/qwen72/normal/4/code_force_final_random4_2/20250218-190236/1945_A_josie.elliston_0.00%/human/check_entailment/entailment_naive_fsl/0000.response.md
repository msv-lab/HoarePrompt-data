Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. 

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal. The introvert must be in a tent alone, which requires 1 tent. The extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others, but there are not enough participants left to fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. However, the program returns `1`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly check if it is possible to form tents with the given constraints. Specifically, it does not ensure that the number of extroverts can be perfectly divided into groups of 3, and it does not handle the case where there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts.
