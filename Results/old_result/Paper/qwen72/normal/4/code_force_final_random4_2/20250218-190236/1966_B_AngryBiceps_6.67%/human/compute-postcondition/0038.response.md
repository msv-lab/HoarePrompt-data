Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` concatenates the first character of the string at the last index of the list `a` to the variable `first_row`.
- `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of the string at the last index of the list `a`.
- The value of `first_row` is updated to include this additional character.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `last_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.
