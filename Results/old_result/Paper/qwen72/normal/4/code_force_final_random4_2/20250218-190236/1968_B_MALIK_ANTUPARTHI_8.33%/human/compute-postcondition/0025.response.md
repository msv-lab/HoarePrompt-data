The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `b` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `b` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[1]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` and `j` retain their updated values. If `d[1]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
