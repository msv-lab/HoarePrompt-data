The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'` to the console. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code is solely determined by the string literal `'No'`.

Output: **No**
