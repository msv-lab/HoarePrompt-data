Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 2, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`, and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer within the given range.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- `s_a` is still increased by the sum of the first three elements of the `nums` list (`nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`).
- `s_b` is now increased by the sum of the last three elements of the `nums` list (`nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 3]`).
- The condition `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` still holds.
- The condition for `ans` (if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is increased by 1) remains unchanged and is still valid.
