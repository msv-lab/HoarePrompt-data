Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`). If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).***
