You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers for each test case. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `n`. If `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is the integer value of `(n - k) * a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, it calculates and prints a value that is the sum of `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus `(n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the input variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If this condition is true, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. This is because the modified price sequence starts at `b` and decreases, so if `a` is already greater than or equal to `b`, there is no benefit in using the modified price.
   - If `a >= b`, the program prints `n * a`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the modified price sequence does not go below `a`.
   - The formula `k = min(b - a + 1, n)` is correct because:
     - `b - a + 1` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a price greater than or equal to `a`.
     - `n` is the total number of buns available, and `k` cannot exceed this.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price using the formula `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series:
     - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1` is given by `k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2`.
   - The program then calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` using the formula `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit `ans + p2`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a >= b` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is very large (up to `10^9`) and `b` is very large (up to `10^9`) by using integer division and ensuring the calculations do not overflow.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The conditions and calculations are accurate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
