Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `a` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` and `c` are input integers.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.
- If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is not equal to `c`, then `b` is less than `c` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c` with the same or different parities.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`.

Output: **YES**
