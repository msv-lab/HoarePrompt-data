The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It checks if `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or if `c` contains at least one character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are found in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
