Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, it is exactly equal to `x`.**
