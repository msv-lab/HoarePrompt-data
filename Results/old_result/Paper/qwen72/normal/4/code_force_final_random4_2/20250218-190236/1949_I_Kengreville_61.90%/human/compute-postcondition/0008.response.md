Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True` and `visited[j]` is `False`, `nodes` is a list that includes `i` at the end, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of numbers of length n, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` updates the value of `coef1[j]` to be the negative of `coef1[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
