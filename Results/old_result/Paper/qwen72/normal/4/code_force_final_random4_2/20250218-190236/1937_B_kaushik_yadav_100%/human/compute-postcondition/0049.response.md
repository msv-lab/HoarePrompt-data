To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are both strings that have been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. This means that `a` and `b` are the same string, just processed to remove any extra spaces at the beginning or end.
   - `ans` is a string that is constructed based on the loop logic. The exact loop logic is not provided, but we can infer that `ans` is built by combining characters from `a` and `b` in some way.
   - `i` is the length of the string `a`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - Since `a` and `b` are the same string after stripping, the loop logic will likely involve iterating over the characters of `a` and `b` and appending them to `ans` in some pattern. Without the exact loop code, we can't determine the specific pattern, but we can describe the general behavior.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which is constructed from the characters of `a` and `b` based on the loop logic. Since `a` and `b` are the same, the output will be a string that is a combination of the characters from `a` (or `b`).

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **ans (where ans is a string constructed from the characters of the input string `a` and `b` after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, based on the loop logic)**
