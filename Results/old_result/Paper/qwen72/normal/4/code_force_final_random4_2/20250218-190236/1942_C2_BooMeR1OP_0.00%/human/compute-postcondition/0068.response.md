Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. It processes these inputs to calculate and print the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by adding up to `y` additional vertices to the polygon with `n` sides, given the vertices Bessie has already chosen. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
