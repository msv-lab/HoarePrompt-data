Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list where each element has been decremented by 1, `n` is still assigned the value from the input, `x` is still assigned the value from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `present` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `gaps` is a sorted list containing the values of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1` where `gap` is greater than 0, `gap` is the second element in `gaps`, `pairs` is `gap // 2`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, `y` is updated to `y - pairs` and `ans` is increased by `gap`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
