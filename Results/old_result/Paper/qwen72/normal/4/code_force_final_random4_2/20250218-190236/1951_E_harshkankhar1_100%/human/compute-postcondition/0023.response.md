Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
   - All characters in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `s[0]`.
   - The current value of `x` is -1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a constant string `'NO'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s`, its length `n`, and the function `func_1`, but none of this information affects the `print` statement.
   - The value of `x` is -1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
