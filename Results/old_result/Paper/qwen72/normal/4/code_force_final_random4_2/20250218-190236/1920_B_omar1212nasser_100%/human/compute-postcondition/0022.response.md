Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `removals` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]` (and if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is also updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`), and `pos` is updated to include the value `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `i + 2`.
- The condition that `removals` must be greater than `i + 2` still holds.
- The value of `s` remains `s - elements[-(i + 2)]`.
- The value of `s2` remains `s2 - elements[-i]`, and if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is further updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
- The list `pos` is updated to include the value `s - 2 * s2`.
