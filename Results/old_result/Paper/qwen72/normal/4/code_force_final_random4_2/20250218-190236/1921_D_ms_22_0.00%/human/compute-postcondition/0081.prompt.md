Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. For each element `i` in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. For each element `i` in `a`, if `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is added to the max heap `max_heap`. The `max_heap` now contains `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was removed from `max_heap`. If the third element of `item` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2` and `tp2` is decreased by 1. If the third element of `item` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1 and `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 + 1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was removed from `max_heap`. If the third element of `item` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2` and `tp2` is decreased by 1. If the third element of `item` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1 and `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 + 1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was previously in `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then if `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
