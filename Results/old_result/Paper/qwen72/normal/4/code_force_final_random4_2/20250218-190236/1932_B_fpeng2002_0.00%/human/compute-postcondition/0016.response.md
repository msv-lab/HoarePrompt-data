Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
