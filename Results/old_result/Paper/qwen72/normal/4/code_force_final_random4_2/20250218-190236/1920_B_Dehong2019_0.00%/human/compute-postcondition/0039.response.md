Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1])`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is initially equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]`.
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[1]` from `ans1`.
- Therefore, `ans1` is now equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
