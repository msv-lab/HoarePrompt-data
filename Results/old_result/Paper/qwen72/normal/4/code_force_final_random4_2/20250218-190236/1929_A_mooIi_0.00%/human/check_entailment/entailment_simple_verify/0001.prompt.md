You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is `t-1`, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `n`, and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array elements.
   - It then converts the sorted array elements to strings and prints them joined by spaces.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements.
   - The problem requires the output to be the maximum beauty value, not the sorted array itself.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the program does not perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not solve the problem as described. It does not compute the maximum beauty of the array but rather prints the sorted array elements.

Correctness: **False**
