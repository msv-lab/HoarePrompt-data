Output State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 2, `b` is now `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is now `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is now `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation:
- `k` was initially decreased by 1. The code `k -= 1` further decreases `k` by 1, so `k` is now decreased by 2.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
