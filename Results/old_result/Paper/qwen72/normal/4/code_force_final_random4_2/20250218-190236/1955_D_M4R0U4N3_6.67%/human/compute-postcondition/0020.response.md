Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[2]` (which is `k`) removed, `done` is a set containing the values `a[0]` (which is `n`), `a[1]` (which is `m`), and `a[2]` (which is `k`), and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` which is `m`).**
