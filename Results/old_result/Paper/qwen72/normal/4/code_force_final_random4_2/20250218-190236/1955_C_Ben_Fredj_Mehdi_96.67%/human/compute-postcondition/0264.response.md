An exception in the given `try` block could occur at the points where the program attempts to access or modify elements of the list `a` using the indices `g` and `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the valid range of indices for the list `a`, an `IndexError` will be raised. Additionally, if `a[g]` or `a[d]` are not valid integers, a `ValueError` could be raised when attempting to convert them to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any exception occurs, the `except` block will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unknown.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `i + 1 < k // 2`. If the indices `g` and `d` are valid and the values at `a[g]` and `a[d]` are integers, the values at these indices are decremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1, and if `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of all variables remains unknown.**
