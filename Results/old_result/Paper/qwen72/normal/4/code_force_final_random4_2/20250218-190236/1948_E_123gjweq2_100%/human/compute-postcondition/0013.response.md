Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are assigned the values `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all assigned the value `clique`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions that `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1 remain unchanged.
- The variable `mid` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- The loop index `i` has reached `mid - 1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The elements in the array `arr` from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left` have been assigned the values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- The elements in the array `cliquess` from index `left` up to `left + mid - 1` have all been assigned the value `clique`.
