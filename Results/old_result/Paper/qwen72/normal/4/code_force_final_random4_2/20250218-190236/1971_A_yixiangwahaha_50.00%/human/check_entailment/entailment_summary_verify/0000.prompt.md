You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100). It then reads 10 pairs of integers (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the input, storing them in two lists `x` and `y`. For each of the 10 pairs, the function prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x` and `y` contain the 10 pairs of integers, and the input `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly for the number of test cases. The problem description specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program always reads 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This will cause the program to either read too many or too few test cases, leading to incorrect output for some inputs.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```
The program will still try to read 10 test cases, which will result in an error or incorrect output because there are only 3 test cases provided.
