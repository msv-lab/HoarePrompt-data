Based on the initial state provided:

- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `v2` is 1.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the print statement:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 1.

So, the print statement will format and print the following string:
```
'? 0 0 1 1'
```

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
