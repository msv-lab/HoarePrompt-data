Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `k` is not equal to 99999999999, 1999999999, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, or 200000000000, and either `n` is not 1, or `k` is not 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1. The current value of `k` is 2147483648 and the current value of `n` is 2.**
