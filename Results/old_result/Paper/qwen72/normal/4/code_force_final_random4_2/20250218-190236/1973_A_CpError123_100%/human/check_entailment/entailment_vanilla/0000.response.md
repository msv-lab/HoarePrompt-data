### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and it prints `-1`.
   - This is because in every game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw) is always even. Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores `a + b`.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Understanding the Calculations:**
   - `x` represents the total number of games played, since each game awards 2 points.
   - `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores. This is because in the worst case, all games involving the two smallest scores could have ended in draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the scores are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given game rules.
   - For valid scores, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games or the sum of the two smallest scores.

### Correctness:
The program is correct because it handles all the edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The calculations and conditions are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
