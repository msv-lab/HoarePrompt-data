Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. `_` is 1: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 0: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
3. `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user: This list contains integers, but the exact values and length of the list are not specified.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`: This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where the keys are the integers from `arr` and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
5. `first` is True: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
6. `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary, and the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1: This means `i` is an integer from the `arr` list that appears exactly once in `arr`.

Given the code snippet:
```
print(i)
```

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is a key in the `mpp` dictionary with a frequency count of 1. Since `i` is an integer from the `arr` list that appears exactly once, the output will be that specific integer.

Output: **i (where i is an integer from the arr list that appears exactly once)**
