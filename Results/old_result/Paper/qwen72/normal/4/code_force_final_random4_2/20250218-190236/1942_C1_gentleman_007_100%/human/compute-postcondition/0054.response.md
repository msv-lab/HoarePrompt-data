Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `q` is an empty deque, `ver` holds the value of the last node processed, and all nodes that were reachable from the initial `ver` and not previously visited are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The deque `q` is empty because all nodes that were added to it have been processed.
- The variable `ver` contains the value of the last node that was processed by the loop.
- The list `vis` has been updated such that every node that was reachable from the initial `ver` and not already visited has been marked as visited (i.e., `vis[node]` is set to 1 for all such nodes).
