Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `minn` is set to infinity, and `len(ar)` is greater than 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `same` is 2 and `num` remains equal to the first element of `ar`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 2.**
