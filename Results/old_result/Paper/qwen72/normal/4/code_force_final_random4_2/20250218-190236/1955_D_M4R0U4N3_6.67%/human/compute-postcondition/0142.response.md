Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution. The `todo` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were not in the initial `m` elements and were not added to `done` during the loop execution. The `done` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `done` during the loop execution. The `extra` set contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `r` is now equal to `n`.
- The variable `old` is the element at the position `a[n - m]`, which is the last element that was checked in the loop.
- The variable `ans` has been incremented by the number of times the length of the `done` set was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.
- The `todo` set contains elements from the input list `a` that were not in the first `m` elements and were not moved to the `done` set during the loop.
- The `done` set contains elements from the input list `a` that were either in the first `m` elements or were added to `done` during the loop.
- The `extra` set contains elements from the input list `a` that were either in the first `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop, but were not moved to `done`.
