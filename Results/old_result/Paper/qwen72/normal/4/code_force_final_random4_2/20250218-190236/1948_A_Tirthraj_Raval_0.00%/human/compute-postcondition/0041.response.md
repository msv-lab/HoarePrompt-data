Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is an empty list. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to the initial value, `i` is `n // 2 - 1` and `pattern` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pattern = []` initializes `pattern` as an empty list.
- The initial state specifies that `pattern` is a list containing certain characters based on the value of `n`. However, the code snippet overrides this by setting `pattern` to an empty list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `pattern` as an empty list, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
