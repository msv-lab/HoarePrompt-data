Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the matrix `mat` is an n×n matrix filled with integers from 1 to n in each row.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` remains unchanged**: The value of `n` is the same as it was when the loop started for each test case. This is because `n` is set at the beginning of each test case and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i` is 0**: The variable `i` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case, and it is used to iterate over the range `n`. After the loop completes, `i` is no longer in scope, but if we consider the state at the end of the loop, `i` would be 0 again for the next test case.
- **`res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**: The variable `res` accumulates the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This sum is calculated once per test case and printed.
- **The matrix `mat` is an n×n matrix filled with integers from 1 to n in each row**: The matrix `mat` is created at the beginning of each test case and is an n×n matrix where each row contains the integers from 1 to `n`. The matrix is not modified after its creation, so it remains in this state after the loop completes.
