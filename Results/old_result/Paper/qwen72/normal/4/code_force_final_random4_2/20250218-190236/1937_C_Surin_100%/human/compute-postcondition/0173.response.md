Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `prev` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `v1` will be a positive integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.
   - The string will be: `? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev]`.

5. **Substituting the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - Therefore, the string will be: `? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `n` is not provided, but we know it must be greater than 1. Let's denote `n-1` as `v1`.
   - The print statement will output: `? [v1] 1 [v1] 0`.

Output: **? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 0 (where n is an integer greater than 1 and [n-1] is the value of n-1)**
