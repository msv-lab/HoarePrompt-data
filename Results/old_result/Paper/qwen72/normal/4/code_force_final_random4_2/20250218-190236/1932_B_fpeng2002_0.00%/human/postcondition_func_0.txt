The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` representing periodicities. It calculates and prints the smallest year that is a multiple of each periodicity in `nums` and is greater than the previous calculated year for each periodicity in the list. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `num_tests` set to 0, and all input values processed. The function does not return any value.
