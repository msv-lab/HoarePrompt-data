Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` & 1 << `cur_ss` == 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
