Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
