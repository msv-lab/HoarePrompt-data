Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` representing the length of a permutation, the duration of a game, and the starting positions of two players, Bodya and Sasha, respectively. It also reads a permutation `p` of length `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The function then simulates a game where Bodya and Sasha move according to the permutation `p` and the array `a` for `k` steps. After the simulation, it compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. **
