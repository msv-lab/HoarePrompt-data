The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'No'`. The initial state describes various conditions and relationships between variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the conditions and relationships described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **No**
