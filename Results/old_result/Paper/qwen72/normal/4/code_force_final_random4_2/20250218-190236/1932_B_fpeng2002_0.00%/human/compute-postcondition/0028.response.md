Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`, and `num_tests` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num_tests -= 1` decreases the value of `num_tests` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `num_tests`.
