The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of the integer `i` in the list `b`. However, `b` is not defined in the initial state, which means this code will raise a `NameError` because `b` is not recognized. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, and a `NameError` is raised because `b` is not defined.**
