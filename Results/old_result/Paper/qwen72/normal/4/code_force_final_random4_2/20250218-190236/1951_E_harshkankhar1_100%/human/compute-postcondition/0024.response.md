Output State: **The program returns None.** 

The return statement is used without specifying any value or variable, so the program returns None. None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate that a function has completed its execution without returning any specific value. In this case, the function does not return any of the variables or values mentioned in the initial state.
