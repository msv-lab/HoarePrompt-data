The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 22, `i` is 4, `j` is `n`**
