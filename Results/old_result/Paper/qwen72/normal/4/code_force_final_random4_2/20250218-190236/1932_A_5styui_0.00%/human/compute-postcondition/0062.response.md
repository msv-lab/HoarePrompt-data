Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is 1. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '*', and the second character is also '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and the second character is not '*', or if the first character of `b` at index `j` is not '*', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` at index `j` is not '@' and not '*', then `s` is 0 and the program continues as is.**
