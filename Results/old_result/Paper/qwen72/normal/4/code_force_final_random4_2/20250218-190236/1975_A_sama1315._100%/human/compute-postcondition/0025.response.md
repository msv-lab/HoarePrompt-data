Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `4 + 3 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**

The code snippet `result = func_1(a)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. The list `results` already contains this returned value, as it was appended to `results` in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The variable `result` now holds the same value as the last element in the `results` list.
