The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.**
