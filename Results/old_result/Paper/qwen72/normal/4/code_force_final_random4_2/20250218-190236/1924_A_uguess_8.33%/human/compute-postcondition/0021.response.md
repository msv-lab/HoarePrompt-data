Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is 0 if `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged.***
