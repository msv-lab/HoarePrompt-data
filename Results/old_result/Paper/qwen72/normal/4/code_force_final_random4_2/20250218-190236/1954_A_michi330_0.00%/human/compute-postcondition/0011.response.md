Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `itest` is 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- The condition is evaluated based on the following:
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true.
  - Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides conditions that determine whether the code snippet will be executed, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement itself.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is given.
   - If this condition is true, the code snippet will be executed.
   - If this condition is false, the code snippet will not be executed (though the problem does not specify what happens in this case, we assume the `print` statement is part of a block that is executed when the condition is true).

2. **Output Determination**:
   - Regardless of the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, if the condition is true, the `print` statement will execute.
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` when it is executed.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes (where the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true)**
