Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]`, and `j` is either `m` or the index where `b[j]` equals `a[2]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
