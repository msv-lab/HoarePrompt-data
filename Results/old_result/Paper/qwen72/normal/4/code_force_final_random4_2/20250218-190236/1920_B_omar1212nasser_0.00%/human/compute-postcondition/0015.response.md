Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the value (s - 2 * n), `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `elements[-i]` from it.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`elements`, `removals`, `negatives`, `pos`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`.
- The value of `n` is updated based on the new value of `i`, but the exact new value of `n` depends on the validity of the indices and the specific values in `elements`.
