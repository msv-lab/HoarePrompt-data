Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least one character, and `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '*', and the second character of `b` is '*', the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
