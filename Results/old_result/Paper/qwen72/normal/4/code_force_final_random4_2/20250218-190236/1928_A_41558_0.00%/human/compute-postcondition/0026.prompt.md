Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` remain odd. Otherwise, either `a` is even, `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even. If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, this condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain odd, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `n` being greater than the new value of `i`. If either `a` or `b` is even, or both are even, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, `a` and `b` are assigned new values from the input, which are integers. If `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`, `a` and `b` are also assigned new values from the input, which are integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
