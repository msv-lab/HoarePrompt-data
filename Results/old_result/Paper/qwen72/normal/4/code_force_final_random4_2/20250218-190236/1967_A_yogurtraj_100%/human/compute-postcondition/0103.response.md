Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `y` is 0, and `r` is updated to `a[1]`.***
