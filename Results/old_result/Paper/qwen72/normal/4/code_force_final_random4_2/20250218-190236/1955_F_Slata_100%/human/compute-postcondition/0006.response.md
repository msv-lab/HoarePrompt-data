The loop head involves the variable `i` and the input integer provided by `int(input())`. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted as it is incremented with each iteration. The input integer, which is the upper limit for the loop, must be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and the input integer must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0, and the input integer for the loop must be greater than 2.**
