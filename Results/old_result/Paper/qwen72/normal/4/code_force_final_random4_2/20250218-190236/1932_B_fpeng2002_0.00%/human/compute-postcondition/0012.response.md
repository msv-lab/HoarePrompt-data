Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The list `nums` must have at least as many elements as the initial value of `num_tests`.
- The variable `x` will be equal to the index of the last element in `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
- The variable `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than `start_year + 1`, after all the iterations of the loop have been completed.
