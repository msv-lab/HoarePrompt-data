- The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses `func_1(a)` to determine the result for each test case, which is correct as per the analysis of `func_1`.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the problem. The concatenation approach in `func_1` ensures that all possible cyclic permutations are checked, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
