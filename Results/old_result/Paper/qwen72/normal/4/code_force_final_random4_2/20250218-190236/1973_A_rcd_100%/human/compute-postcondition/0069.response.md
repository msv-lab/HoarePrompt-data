Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 2.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Precondition Check**:
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. This means that the sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is divisible by 2.
   - If the sum is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. However, since the precondition states that the sum is even, this condition is satisfied.

2. **Variable Values**:
   - `p1` and `p2` are integers where \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq 30\).
   - The exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but they are known to be within the specified range and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(p1 + p2)` will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Output:
The code prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`, where `p1` and `p2` are integers provided by the user such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq 30\) and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is even)**
