Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `a`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- **`ar`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- **`num`**: `num` will be the last integer in `ar` because the loop updates `num` to the current integer in `ar` whenever it encounters a new integer.
- **`same`**: `same` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`. This is because the loop increments `same` for each consecutive occurrence of `num` and resets it to 1 when a new integer is found.
- **`minn`**: `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`. This is because the loop updates `minn` to the minimum value between its current value and `same` whenever it encounters a new integer.
