Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `index` is `index + 1`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the value `i` appended to its previous list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1.
- All other preconditions remain valid, including the updates to `a[i]`, `pf[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]`, as well as the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
