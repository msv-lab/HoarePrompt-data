Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, and the `index` of `item` (i.e., `item[2]`) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is `diff1`, `tp1` is 1, and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `tp1` is 0, and `tp2` is `m - 2`.***
