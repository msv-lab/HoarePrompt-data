Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`, followed by the permutation itself. This part is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The function `func_1` implements the binary search algorithm. The initial values for `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n` respectively, which is correct for a 0-indexed array. The loop continues until `r - l` is greater than 1, which is the standard termination condition for binary search. This part is also accurate.

3. **Middle Index Calculation**: The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, which is the correct way to find the midpoint in a binary search. This is accurate.

4. **Comparison and Update**: The program updates `l` or `r` based on whether the element at the middle index `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`. This is the correct logic for binary search. This part is accurate.

5. **Result Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `find`. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of `l` and the actual position of `find` in the array, indicating that a single swap is needed to make the binary search work correctly. This part is accurate in terms of identifying the need for a swap.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) and the indices for the swap if needed. However, the function `func_1` is designed to only handle a single swap, which is not sufficient for the problem statement that allows up to 2 swaps.

7. **Handling Multiple Swaps**: The problem statement requires that the program should be able to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The current implementation only checks for and performs a single swap, which may not always be enough to make the permutation suitable for binary search. This is a critical flaw in the program.

8. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where more than one swap might be necessary. For example, if the permutation is such that the target value `x` is in a position that requires two swaps to be correctly found by the binary search, the program will fail. This is a significant issue that the original assessment correctly identified.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the requirement of performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

Final: **False**
