To determine what will be printed by the `print('Sasha')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the initial value of `n`.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`.
- `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
- `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times).
- `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks and the final state is determined at that point.
- Additionally, `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`.
- The initial state and the variables described do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not use any of these variables or their values.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
