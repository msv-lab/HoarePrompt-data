Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]`**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]` with the new value of `j`.
