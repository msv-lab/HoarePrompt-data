To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `data`. The loop will execute if `data` is a non-empty list. The other variables (`times`, `_`, `n`, `dic`, `ans`, `check`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `times` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `data` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `dic` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is 0
- `check` is 2147483647

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `data` to ensure it has at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `data` when the loop starts.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first integer in `data`**
