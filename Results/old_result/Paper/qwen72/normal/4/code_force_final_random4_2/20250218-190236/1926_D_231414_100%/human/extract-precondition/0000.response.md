Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
