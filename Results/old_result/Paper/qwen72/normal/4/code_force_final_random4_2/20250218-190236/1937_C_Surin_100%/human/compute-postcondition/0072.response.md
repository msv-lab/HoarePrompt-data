Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid, and the output state is the same as the initial state.
