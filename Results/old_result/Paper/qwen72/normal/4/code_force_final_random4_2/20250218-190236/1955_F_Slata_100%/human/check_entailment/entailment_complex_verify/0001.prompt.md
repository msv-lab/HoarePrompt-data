You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the input integers, each greater than 0, and the loop has executed `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a value which is the sum of half the counts of each integer (rounded down) plus 1 if exactly three of the counts are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, and the final state includes the printed results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The numbers in the sequence are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative: \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4**:
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 7 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 6 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 5 \)

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Eve should remove pairs of numbers that result in a zero XOR to maximize Bob's wins.
   - If there are an even number of any number, removing pairs of that number will not change the overall XOR.
   - If there are an odd number of any number, removing pairs will eventually leave one number, which will affect the XOR.

5. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each number, count how many pairs can be removed: \( \text{pairs} = \text{count} // 2 \).
   - Sum the pairs for all numbers to get the total number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero.

6. **Handling Odd Counts**:
   - If there are odd counts of numbers, the remaining numbers will affect the XOR.
   - If there are exactly three odd counts, removing one of each will make the XOR zero, which is an additional win for Bob.

7. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed: \( a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 \).
   - It checks if there are exactly three odd counts and adds 1 to the result if true.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - It correctly handles the case where there are exactly three odd counts.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
