Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is now `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`).**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding the result of the left shift operation `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. The left shift operation `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions, effectively calculating 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
