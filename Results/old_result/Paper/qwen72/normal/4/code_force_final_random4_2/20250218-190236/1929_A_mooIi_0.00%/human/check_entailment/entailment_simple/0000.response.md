Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the problem described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, sorts the array and then prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string. This does not solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be rearranged to maximize the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). One way to achieve this is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program does not perform this calculation and instead just prints the sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_beauty():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array to maximize the beauty
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the beauty
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        
        # Output the result
        print(beauty)

# Example usage
max_beauty()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. It correctly outputs the maximum beauty for each test case.

Given the incorrectness of the provided program, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
