The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**
