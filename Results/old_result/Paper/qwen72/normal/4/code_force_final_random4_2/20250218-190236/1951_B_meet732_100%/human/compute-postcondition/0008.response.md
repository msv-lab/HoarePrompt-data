Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the integer `0`, `c` is 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. The current value of `c` is 2.**
