Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The problem description requires the program to output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the program incorrectly prints the larger number first and the smaller number second when `x > y`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed first, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`, which matches the problem description.
