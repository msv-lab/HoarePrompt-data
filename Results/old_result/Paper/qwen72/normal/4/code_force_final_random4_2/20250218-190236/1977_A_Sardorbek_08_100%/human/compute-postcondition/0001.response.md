The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`, but only `a` is relevant to the loop head. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
