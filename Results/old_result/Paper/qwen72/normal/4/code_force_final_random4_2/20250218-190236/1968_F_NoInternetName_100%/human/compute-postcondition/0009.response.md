Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30, `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has a new element appended which is the result of `x[-2] ^ a[1]`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is between 0 and 2^30.
- The variable `i` is still the second element of `a`, i.e., `a[1]`.
- The list `x` now has a new element appended, which is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` before the operation (`x[-2]`) and `i` (which is `a[1]`).
- The dictionary `inds` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` for the new last element of `x`.
