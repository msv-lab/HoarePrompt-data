Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `b`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is updated to `chr(ord('a') + i)`, which is `chr(ord('a') + 1)`, resulting in the character `b`.
- The values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
