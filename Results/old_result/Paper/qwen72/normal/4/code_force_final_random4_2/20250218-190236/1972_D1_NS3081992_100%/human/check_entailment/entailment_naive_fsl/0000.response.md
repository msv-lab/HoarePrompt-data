Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the logic in `func_15` does not correctly implement this condition. The loop and the condition inside the loop do not reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`. The valid pairs should be (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), but the current implementation does not correctly count these pairs. The function `func_15` needs to be revised to correctly implement the problem's logic.
