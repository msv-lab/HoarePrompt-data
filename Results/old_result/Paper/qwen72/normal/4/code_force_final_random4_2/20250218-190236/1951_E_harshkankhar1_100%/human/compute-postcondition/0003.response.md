The provided code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is within the range 1 to 10^6.
   - `x` is -1.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Determination of Output:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
