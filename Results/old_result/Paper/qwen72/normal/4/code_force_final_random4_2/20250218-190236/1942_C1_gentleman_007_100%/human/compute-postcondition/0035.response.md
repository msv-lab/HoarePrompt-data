Postcondition: ***`q` has one less element than before, `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes, `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` has the same number of elements as before, `node` is appended to `q`, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` retains its value.***
