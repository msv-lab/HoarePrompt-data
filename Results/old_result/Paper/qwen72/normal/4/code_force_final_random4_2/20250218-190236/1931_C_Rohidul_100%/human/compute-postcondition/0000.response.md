The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
