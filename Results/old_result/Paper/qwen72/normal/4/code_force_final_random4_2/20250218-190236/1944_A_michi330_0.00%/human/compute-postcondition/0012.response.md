Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, and `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program maintains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` as they were initially. Otherwise, the program also maintains the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` as they were initially.***
