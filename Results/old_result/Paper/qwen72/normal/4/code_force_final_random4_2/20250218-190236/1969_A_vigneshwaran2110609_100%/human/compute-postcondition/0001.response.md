The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is already within the range 2 to 50, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but the `range(n)` function will start `i` at 0 by default.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that `i` starts at 0, which is already the default behavior of `range(n)`. However, since `n` is already given to be within the range 2 to 50, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `i` is implicitly 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 0**
