The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `a` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1, or `j + 1` if the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`.**
