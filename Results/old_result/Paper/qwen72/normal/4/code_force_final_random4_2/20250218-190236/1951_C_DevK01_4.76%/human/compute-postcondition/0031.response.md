Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of elements in `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**

Explanation:
- The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`.
- The length of `N` is reduced by 1, so `n` (which is the number of elements in `N`) is now `n - 1`.
- The list `N` now contains the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
- The variable `w` holds the value of the last element that was removed from `N`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `m`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged.
