Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with the first element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was 0, the list `a` now starts from its second element. The length of `a` is reduced by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
