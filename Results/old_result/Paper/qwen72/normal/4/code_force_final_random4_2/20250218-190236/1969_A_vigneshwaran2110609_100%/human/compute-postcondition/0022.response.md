Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged.** 

The code snippet `x = int(input())` updates the value of `x` to a new input integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
