### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a` and adjusts the index `k` to be zero-based.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum number of matches your cow can win.
   - It initializes `x` to the rating of your cow at index `k`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and stores these indices in `ind`.
   - If fewer than two cows have higher ratings, the loop breaks after finding the first one or none at all.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating (`ind` is empty):**
     - If no cows have a higher rating, your cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The program correctly returns `n - 1`.

   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If the only cow with a higher rating is at index 0, your cow can win `k - 1` matches.
     - If the cow with a higher rating is after your cow (`ind[0] > k`), your cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If the cow with a higher rating is before your cow (`ind[0] <= k`), the maximum number of matches your cow can win is the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
     - The program correctly handles these sub-cases.

   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first cow with a higher rating is at index 0, your cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` matches.
     - If your cow is after the second cow with a higher rating (`k > ind[1]`), your cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
     - If your cow is before or at the second cow with a higher rating (`k <= ind[1]`), your cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` matches.
     - The program correctly handles these sub-cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `k` is 1 or `n` (the first or last cow) appropriately.
   - It also handles cases where there are no cows with higher ratings or only one cow with a higher rating correctly.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of matches your cow can win. The reasoning and the handling of different cases are sound and align with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
