Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd**: This means that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is an odd number. For the sum of three integers to be odd, one of the following conditions must be true:
   - Two of the integers are even, and one is odd.
   - All three integers are odd.

2. **Continuation to the next iteration**: The precondition states that if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. However, this does not affect the execution of the `print` statement within the current iteration.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are input integers and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
