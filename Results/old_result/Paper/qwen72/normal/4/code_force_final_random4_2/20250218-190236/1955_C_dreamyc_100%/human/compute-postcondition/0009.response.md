Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is 0, `s_a` is increased by `nums[0]`, `s_b` is increased by `nums[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` updates the value of `s_b` by adding the value of `nums[n - 1]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the `nums` list. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `s_a` retains its updated value from the initial state.
