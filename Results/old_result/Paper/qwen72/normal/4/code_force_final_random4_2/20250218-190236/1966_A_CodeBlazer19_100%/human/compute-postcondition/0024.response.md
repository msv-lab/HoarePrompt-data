Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n` and `k` will be the input integers from the last test case, and `l` will be the list of integers provided by the user for the last test case. The list `p` will contain the counts of each unique integer in the list `l` from the last test case. The loop will have printed `k-1` if the maximum count in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `n` if the maximum count in `p` is less than `k`, for each of the `t` test cases.
