    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cliques`. However, based on the given constraints and the formula, the print statement will output the ceiling of \(n / k\).

    #This is printed: 0 0 ... 0 [cliques] [cliques] ... [cliques] (where the number of 0s is \((cliques - 1) * k\) and the number of [cliques] is \(\min(cliques * k - 1, n - 1) - (cliques - 1) * k + 1\))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive). It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n` with all elements set to 0. It then calls the `make_array` function for each clique, which modifies the `arr` list by setting specific elements to non-zero values. After the loop, the function prints the `arr` list, which contains non-zero values in a specific range based on the number of cliques and the value of `k`. It also prints the number of cliques. Finally, it prints the `cliquess` list, which remains unchanged (all elements are 0). The function does not return any value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function modifies two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are filled with a sequence of integers. The first half of this range (from `left + mid - 1` to `left`) is filled with values starting from `left + 1` and increasing by 1, while the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) is filled with values starting from `right + 1` and decreasing by 1. All elements in the `cliquess` array from index `left` to `right` are set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.
