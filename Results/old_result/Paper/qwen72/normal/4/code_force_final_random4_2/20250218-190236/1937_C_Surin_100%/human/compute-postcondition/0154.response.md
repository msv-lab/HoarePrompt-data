Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new input string '<', `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`.
- Before the code execution, `v2` was 1.
- After the code execution, `v1` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
