Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j]` to the variable `dy`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. The new variable `dy` is now equal to the difference between the integer at index `i` in the list `y` and the integer at index `j` (which is 2) in the list `y`.
