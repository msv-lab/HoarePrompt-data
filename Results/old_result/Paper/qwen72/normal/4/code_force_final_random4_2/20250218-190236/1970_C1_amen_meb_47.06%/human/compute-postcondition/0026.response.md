Functionality: ** The function reads pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` from user input until the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. It returns a list `numbers` containing all the valid pairs of integers `[num1, num2]` that were input by the user, where each pair consists of integers `num1` and `num2` such that 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ n, and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `numbers` will include all the pairs up to the point where the user inputs a line that does not contain exactly two numbers. **
