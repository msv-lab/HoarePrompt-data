Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is `coef0[j]`, `c1` is 0, `ok` is `False`, and `nodes` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c0` is updated to `c0 + coef0[j]`.
- Since `c0` was initially 0, after the execution, `c0` will be equal to `coef0[j]`.
- The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a valid index for `coef0`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
