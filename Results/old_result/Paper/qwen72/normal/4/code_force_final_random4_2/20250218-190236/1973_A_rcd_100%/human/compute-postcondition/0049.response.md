Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `y` is set to `p3 - 1`, `x` is set to 1, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.***
