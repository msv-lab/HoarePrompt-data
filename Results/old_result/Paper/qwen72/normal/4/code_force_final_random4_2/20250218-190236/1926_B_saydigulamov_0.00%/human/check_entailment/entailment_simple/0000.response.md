### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` starts by reading an integer `a`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function maintains a list `k` to store the count of '1' characters in each row that contains at least one '1'.
   - After reading the grid, it checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints `k`.

3. **Output and Logic**:
   - The function is supposed to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - However, the function only prints `k` if the first and second elements of `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If the counts of '1' in all rows are equal, it is a square.
     - If the counts of '1' form a sequence where each count is 2 more than the previous count (or 2 less for an upside-down triangle), it is a triangle.
   - The current implementation does not perform these checks and simply prints the list `k` if the first two elements are equal.

4. **Missing Output**:
   - The function does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
   - It only prints the list `k` in certain cases, which is not the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the shape and does not produce the required output.

Correctness: **False**
