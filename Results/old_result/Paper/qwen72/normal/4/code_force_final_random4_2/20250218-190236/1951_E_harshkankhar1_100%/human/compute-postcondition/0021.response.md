Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters as input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `func_1(s[0:])` is True. If any character in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` is set to the index of the first such character. If all characters from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `s[0]`, `x` remains -1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The string `s` remains unchanged and consists of lowercase Latin characters.
- The length `n` of the string `s` must be greater than 1.
- The function `func_1(s[0:])` is still True.
- The variable `x` will be set to the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character `s[0]`. If no such character exists (i.e., all characters in `s` from index 1 to `n-1` are the same as `s[0]`), `x` will remain -1.
