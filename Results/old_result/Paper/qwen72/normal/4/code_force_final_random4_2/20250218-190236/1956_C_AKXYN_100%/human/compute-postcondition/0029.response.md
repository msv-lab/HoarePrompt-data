The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `res` is 1, the calculation is:

- `i + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2
- `2 * i + 1` = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3
- `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` = 2 * 3 = 6

So, `res` becomes 1 + 6 = 7. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is 7, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**
