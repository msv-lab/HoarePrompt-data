The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in the list `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`**
