Output State: **`t` is 0, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\) for each test case, `i` is `n + 1` for each test case, `j` is `n` for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run for `t` times, and `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the variable `sum` will be the result of the inner loop, which calculates the sum of the series \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\). The variable `i` will be `n + 1` for each test case because the inner loop runs from 2 to `n`, and `i` is incremented to `n + 1` after the last iteration. Similarly, the variable `j` will be `n` for each test case because the second inner loop runs from 1 to `n`, and `j` is incremented to `n` after the last iteration. The values of `n` for each test case will remain as they were input, and the loop will have printed the required output for each test case.
