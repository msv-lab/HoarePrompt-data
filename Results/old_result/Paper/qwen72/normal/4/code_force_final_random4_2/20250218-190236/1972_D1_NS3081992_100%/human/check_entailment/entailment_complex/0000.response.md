Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_10` to read the number of test cases `t` from the standard input. This function correctly reads an integer from the input.

2. **Test Case Processing**: The program uses `func_15` to process each test case. This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the standard input using `func_7`, and then calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Condition Checking**: The condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is checked by the loop in `func_15`. The loop iterates over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in the problem statement) and calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `i`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_15` for each test case, which is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the only valid pair is `(1, 1)`, and the program correctly returns `1`.

6. **Efficiency**: The loop in `func_15` runs up to `i * i <= n + i` or `i <= m`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6).

7. **Correctness of `func_13`**: The function `func_13` is used to compute the GCD and the coefficients for the equation `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)`. However, this function is not used in the main logic of `func_15` or `func_16`, so its correctness is not directly relevant to the problem.

8. **Relevance of Other Functions**: Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_11`, and `func_12` are not used in the main logic of the program, so their correctness is not directly relevant to the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The main functions `func_15` and `func_16` work together to read the inputs, process each test case, and print the results.

Correctness: **True**
