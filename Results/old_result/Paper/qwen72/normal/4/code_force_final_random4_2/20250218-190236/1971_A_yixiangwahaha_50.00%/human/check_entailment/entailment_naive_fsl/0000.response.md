Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly for the number of test cases. The problem description specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, but the program always reads 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This will cause the program to either read too many or too few test cases, leading to incorrect output for some inputs.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```
The program will still try to read 10 test cases, which will result in an error or incorrect output because there are only 3 test cases provided.
