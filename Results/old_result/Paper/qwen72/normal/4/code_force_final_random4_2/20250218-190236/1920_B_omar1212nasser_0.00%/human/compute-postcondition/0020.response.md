To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head: `i` and `removals`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `1` to `removals + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `removals` must still be greater than or equal to the current value of `i` for the loop to execute again.

Let's break it down:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the values (s - 2 * n) and (s - 2 * n) appended, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Given the loop head:
```
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
```

The specific adjustments are:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `removals` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`elements` is a list of integers, `removals` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `i`, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), `pos` is a list containing the values (s - 2 * n) and (s - 2 * n) appended, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `elements[-(i+1)]`, `n` is updated to the sum of the last `negatives` integers in the list `elements` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the indices are valid, otherwise `n` is set to 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
