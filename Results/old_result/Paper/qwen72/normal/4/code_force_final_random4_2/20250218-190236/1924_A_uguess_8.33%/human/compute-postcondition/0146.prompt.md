Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `b` if the bit at position `1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 2. If the bit at position 2 in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character `c`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
