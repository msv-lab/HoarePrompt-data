The code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, and the values of `dp` are `[0, 1, 3, 8, 26, 0]` (since `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, and `m` must be at least 4, the list has at least 5 elements, and the first four elements are given as 1, 3, 8, and 26).

The calculation for `dp[5]` is:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) \times dp[3] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (26 + 4 \times 8 \times 2) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = (26 + 64) \mod 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = 90 \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 90.**
