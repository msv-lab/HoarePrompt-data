Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.
   - `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of `ar`.
   - `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.
   - `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`.

4. **Determine the Value of `minn`:**
   - Since `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to `len(ar)`, it must be a finite integer.
   - The value of `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.
   - `minn` is updated to be the minimum of the original `minn` and `same`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will print the minimum value between the original `minn` and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.

Since the exact values of `ar` and the original `minn` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `minn`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the minimum value between the original `minn` and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the original minn and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in ar)**
