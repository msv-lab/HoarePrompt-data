Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k == 99999999999`, the list `a` and the variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `n == 1` and `k == 10000000000000` and `a[0] == 1`, the list `a` and the variables `t` and `z` remain unchanged. If `k` is 9999999999, 100000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 2000000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` is not 20, the first `g` elements and the last `d - g + 1` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is an odd integer, the `g`-th element of `a` has also been decremented by 1. If the `g`-th element of `a` was 1 before the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1. The loop will terminate either when `i` reaches `k // 2` or when an exception occurs due to `g` or `d` being out of bounds.***
