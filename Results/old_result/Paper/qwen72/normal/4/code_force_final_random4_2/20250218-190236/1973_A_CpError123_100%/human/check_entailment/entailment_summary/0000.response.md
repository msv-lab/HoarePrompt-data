Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - `x` is calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, assuming each game results in 2 points (either 2 points for a win or 2 points for a draw).
   - `y` is calculated as `a + b`. This represents the total points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned together.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is intended to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.

4. **Correctness of the Calculation**:
   - The maximum number of draws can be at most the total number of games played, which is `x`.
   - The maximum number of draws can also be at most the total points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned together, which is `y`.
   - Therefore, the minimum of `x` and `y` is a reasonable approach to find the maximum number of draws.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where all scores are zero (`0 0 0`), the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the case where the scores are `0 1 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one draw could have occurred.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws could have occurred.
   - For the case where the scores are `3 3 3`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case where the scores are `3 4 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because six draws could have occurred.
   - For the case where the scores are `1 1 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because two draws and some wins/losses could have occurred.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the test cases correctly and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
