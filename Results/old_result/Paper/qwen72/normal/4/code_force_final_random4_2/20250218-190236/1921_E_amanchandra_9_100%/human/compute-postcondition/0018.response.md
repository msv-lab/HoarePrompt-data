Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns new values to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on user input.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 1, which remain unchanged.
- The values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are now the integers provided by the user, replacing any previous values they might have had.
- No other variables or conditions are affected by this code snippet.
