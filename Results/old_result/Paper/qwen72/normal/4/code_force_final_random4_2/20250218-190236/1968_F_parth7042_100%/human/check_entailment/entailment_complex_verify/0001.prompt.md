You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries` where `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `queries` is a list of tuples representing the queries. Each `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `q` satisfies 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` with 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #This is printed: [t*q lines of 'YES' or 'NO' (where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' and t*q is the length of the results list)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of query tuples `queries`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero. If the XOR is zero, or if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`, the function appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the function prints the results, one per line. The final state of the program is that `index` is `7 + 2*t*q` and `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length `t*q`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to optimize input reading for large inputs.
   - The index variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The program processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1`.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is built such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - The dictionary `mp` is updated to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part has a XOR of 0, which is an interesting array. The program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values. It does this by:
     - Finding the first index `v1[it1]` in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l`.
     - Finding the last index `v2[it2]` in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
     - If `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, it means there is a way to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR values, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR array and uses it to efficiently answer the queries.
- The use of the dictionary `mp` to store indices of prefix XOR values allows for quick lookups and checks.
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is correct. If the XOR of the subarray is 0, it is trivially interesting. If not, the program checks if there are indices that allow for a valid split.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
