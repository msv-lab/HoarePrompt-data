Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 0. If `i + x` < `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[x]`, and `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` retain their original values as the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` and the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, respectively.***
