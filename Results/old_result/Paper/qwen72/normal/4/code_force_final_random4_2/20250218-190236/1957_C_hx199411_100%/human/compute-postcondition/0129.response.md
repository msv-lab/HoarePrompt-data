The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, as well as a list of moves represented by pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, representing the size of the board and the number of moves, respectively. Each move is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.

The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the given parameters and moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a board of size `n` and `k` valid moves. The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the given parameters and moves.**
