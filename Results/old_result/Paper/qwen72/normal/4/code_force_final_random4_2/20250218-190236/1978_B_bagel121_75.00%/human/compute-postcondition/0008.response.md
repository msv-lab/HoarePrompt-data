Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, `p2` is the integer value of `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- `p2` is now an integer value equal to `(n - k) * a`.
