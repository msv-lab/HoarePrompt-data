Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has completed.
- The variable `m` remains the same input integer as before.
- The list `a` contains `n` input strings, each added in the order they were input.
- The string `first_row` is composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, concatenated in the order the strings were added to `a`.
- The string `last_row` is composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, concatenated in the order the strings were added to `a`.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, which is the index of the last iteration of the loop.
