To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `b` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is an input string.
   - `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken.
   - `k` is the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.

2. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is determined by the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1.
   - If no character in `d` is found in `e`, `k` will be 0.
   - If a character in `d` is found in `e`, `k` will be the index of the last such character plus 1.
   - If the loop is broken before finding any character, `k` will be the index where the loop was broken.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k` as described above.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **k (where k is the index of the last character in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken)**
