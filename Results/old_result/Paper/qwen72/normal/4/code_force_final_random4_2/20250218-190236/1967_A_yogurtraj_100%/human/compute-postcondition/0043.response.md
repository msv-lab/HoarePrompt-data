The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the variable `ii`. The loop will execute one more time if `ii` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented by 1, so `ii` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `ii` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` remains not 0. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.**
