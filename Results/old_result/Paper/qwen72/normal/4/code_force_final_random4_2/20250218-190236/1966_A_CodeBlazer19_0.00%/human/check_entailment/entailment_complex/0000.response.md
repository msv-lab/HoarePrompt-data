Reasoning:
The provided function `func` does not correctly solve the problem described. The function simply reads the input and prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` cards with the same number. The function should count the frequency of each card number and then determine how many cards are left after performing the operations optimally. The optimal strategy involves repeatedly exchanging the largest possible groups of `k` cards with the same number until no more such groups can be formed.

The function provided does not perform any of these steps. Instead, it just prints `k - 1`, which is a fixed value and does not depend on the actual input data. This means the function will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

For example, in the first test case:
- Input: `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`
- The correct output should be `2` because you can perform one operation to exchange three `4`s and be left with two cards (one `1` and one `4`).

However, the function will print `2` for any test case where `k = 3`, regardless of the actual card numbers and their frequencies.

Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
