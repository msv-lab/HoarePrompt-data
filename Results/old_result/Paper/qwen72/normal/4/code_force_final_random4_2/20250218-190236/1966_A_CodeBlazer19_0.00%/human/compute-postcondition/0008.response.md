Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(k - 1)
```

This statement will print the value of `k` minus 1. Since `k` is an input integer provided by the user, the exact value of `k` is not known, but the output will be `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second integer input by the user)**
