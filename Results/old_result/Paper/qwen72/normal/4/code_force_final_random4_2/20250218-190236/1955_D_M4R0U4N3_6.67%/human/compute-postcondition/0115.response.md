Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.***
