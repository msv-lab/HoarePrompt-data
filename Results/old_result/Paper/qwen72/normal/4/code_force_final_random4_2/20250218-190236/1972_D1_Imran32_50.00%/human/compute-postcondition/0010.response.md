Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `ans` is equal to `n` + (`n` + 2) // 4 + (`n` + 3) // 9, `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1, `i` is 4, `cnt` is 16**

The value of `cnt` is updated to 16, which is the result of `i * i` where `i` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
