The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each inner list has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` with dimensions (n + 1) x (m + 1), where `n` is the number of inner lists in `l` and `m` is the length of each inner list. The element `p[i][j]` contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1). The first row and the first column of `p` are all zeros. The original list `l` remains unchanged.
