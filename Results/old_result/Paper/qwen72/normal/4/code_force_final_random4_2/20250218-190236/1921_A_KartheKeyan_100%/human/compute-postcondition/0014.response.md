Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 4 iterations, the variable `total` remains 0, the list `coord` contains 4 tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates `(x, y)` that were input during the loop's execution. The variable `res` remains 0, and the loop index `i` is 3 (since the loop index starts at 0 and increments up to 3). The variables `x` and `y` hold the last set of input integers that were read during the final iteration of the loop.
