You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). For each test case, the function removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list, prints the modified list, counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the results (modified lists and zero counts) have been printed. The function does not return any values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. Specifically, it prints the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros, and then counts the zeros in the middle, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
8
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```

The correct output should be `3`, because you can move the chips at positions 2, 4, and 6 to positions 3, 5, and 7, respectively, to form a single block of chips. However, the given program will output `4` because it counts the number of zeros in the middle of the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of operations, you should:
1. Identify the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips.
2. Count the number of chips in the segment between these positions.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to the left or right to form a single block.

This can be done by:
- Finding the first and last index of `1` in the list.
- Counting the number of `0`s between these indices.
- The minimum number of operations is the number of `0`s between the first and last `1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def min_operations_to_form_block(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first and last index of 1
        first_chip = a.index(1)
        last_chip = n - 1 - a[::-1].index(1)
        
        # Count the number of 0s between the first and last chip
        res = a[first_chip:last_chip].count(0)
        
        print(res)

# Example usage
# t = int(input())
# min_operations_to_form_block(t)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
