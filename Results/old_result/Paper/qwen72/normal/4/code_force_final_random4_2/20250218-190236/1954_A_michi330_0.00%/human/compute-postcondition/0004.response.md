Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `itest` is 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- Either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
