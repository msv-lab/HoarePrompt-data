To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `low + 1 < high`. Let's analyze the given state and the condition:

- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n-1`.
- `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` simplifies to `1 < high`. Since `high` is `n-1`, the condition becomes `1 < n-1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n-1`.
- `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low` is updated to `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.

Given that `n` is greater than 2, the condition `1 < high` (or `n > 2`) is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low` is updated to `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`.**
