Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s` and must have at least three keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` < `m`, otherwise `ans` remains the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not in `hmp`.**
