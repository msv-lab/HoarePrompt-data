### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem description specifies that the function should take two parameters `n` and `m`. The variable `k` is not used anywhere in the function, which suggests a misinterpretation of the input.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function calculates `ans` as `n` plus a series of terms derived from `n` and its square root. Specifically, it computes:
     \[
     \text{ans} = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left( \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right)
     \]
   - This calculation is entirely unrelated to the problem statement, which requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs \((a, b)\) are:
     - (1, 1): \(1 + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
     - (2, 1): \(2 + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
     - (2, 2): \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)
   - The total number of valid pairs is 3. However, the provided program would produce a different output because it is not implementing the correct logic.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
