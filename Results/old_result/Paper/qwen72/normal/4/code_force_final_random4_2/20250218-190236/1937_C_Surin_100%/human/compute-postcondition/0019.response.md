Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the same as the value of `v2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
