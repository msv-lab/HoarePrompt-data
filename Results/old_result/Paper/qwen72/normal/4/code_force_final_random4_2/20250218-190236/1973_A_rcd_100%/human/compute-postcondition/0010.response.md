Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is 0. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.**

The initial conditions for `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variable `x` is assigned the value 0, which was not previously defined. The conditions regarding the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd and `p3` being less than the sum of `p1` and `p2` still hold.
