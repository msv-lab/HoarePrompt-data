Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 * t + 1 + t * n`, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)` in the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `n` holds the integer value of the last `n` read from `data` (2 <= n <= 50).
- The variable `a` is a list of `n` integers, which were the last set of integers read from `data` and converted to integers.
- The variable `data` remains unchanged as it is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- The variable `idx` is now at the position `2 * t + 1 + t * n`, which is the index after all the integers for the last iteration have been read.
- The variable `results` is a list that contains the values returned by `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(a)` in the last iteration of the loop.
