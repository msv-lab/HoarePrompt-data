Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The check `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:` is incorrect. The first element of the prefix maximums list `L` should be 1, and the last element of the suffix maximums list `R` should be `N`, but the program incorrectly checks `R[0]` instead of `R[-1]`.
   - The check `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):` is also incorrect. It should check if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`, but the indices used are incorrect. It should be `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):`.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The initial combination calculation `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is incorrect. The correct initial combination should be `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 2)` because the maximum element `N` is already fixed at position `L[-1]`.

3. **Left and Right Multiplications**:
   - The logic for multiplying the number of ways to place elements on the left and right sides of the fixed maximum element is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` is applied correctly, but the overall logic for calculating the number of permutations is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def func_1():
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is N
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the second-to-last prefix maximum is the same as the second suffix maximum
    if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the initial combination
    ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 2)
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place elements on the left side
    cur = M1 - 2
    nums_left = L[-1] - 2
    i = L[-1] - 1
    while i > 1:
        if i == L[cur]:
            cur -= 1
        else:
            ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
        nums_left -= 1
        i -= 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place elements on the right side
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    cur = 1
    i = R[0] + 1
    while i < N:
        if i == R[cur]:
            cur += 1
        else:
            ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
        nums_left -= 1
        i += 1
    
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - `if L[-1] != R[0]:` ensures that the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum.
   - `if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:` ensures that the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `N`.
   - `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:` ensures that the second-to-last prefix maximum is not the same as the second suffix maximum.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 2)` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements on the left side of the fixed maximum element.

3. **Left and Right Multiplications**:
   - The while loops correctly calculate the number of ways to place the remaining elements on the left and right sides of the fixed maximum element.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
