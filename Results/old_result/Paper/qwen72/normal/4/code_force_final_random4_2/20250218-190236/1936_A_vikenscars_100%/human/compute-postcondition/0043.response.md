Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `pair_idx` is set to 2. If `ans1` is not '<' and `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is '>', then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `pair_idx` retains its previous value.***
