Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returned '<' for the last time, or 0 if `func_1` never returned '<' during the loop execution, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pair_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`.
- Since `i` is 1 in the initial state, `pair_idx` is now 1.
- The values of `n`, `max_item_idx`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `pair_idx` being set to 0 or remaining equal to `max_item_idx` based on the results of `func_1` is not affected by this code snippet.
