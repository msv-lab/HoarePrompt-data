Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The program does not correctly identify the shape (triangle or square) based on the pattern of `1`s in the grid.
2. The program only checks if the first and second rows have the same number of `1`s, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all rows should have the same number of `1`s, and for a triangle, the number of `1`s should increase or decrease by 2 for each subsequent row.
3. The program does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement. It should read the number of test cases, then for each test case, read the grid and output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape.
4. The program does not check the central alignment of `1`s for triangles or the equal distance from the left edge for squares.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the grid.
3. Check if the grid forms a square or a triangle based on the pattern of `1`s.
4. Output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for row in grid:
        if row.count('1') != grid[0].count('1'):
            return False
    return True

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    ones_count = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
    if ones_count == ones_count[::-1]:  # Check if it's an upside-down triangle
        ones_count = ones_count[::-1]
    for i in range(n):
        if ones_count[i] != 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")  # If not a square, it must be a triangle

func()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the grid forms a square or a triangle and outputs the appropriate result for each test case.
