Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `first` is True.
   - The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Therefore, based on the initial state, the value of `i` is 0.

Output: **0**
