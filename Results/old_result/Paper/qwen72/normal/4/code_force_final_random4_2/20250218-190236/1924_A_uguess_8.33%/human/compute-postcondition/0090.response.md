The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an input integer greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `k` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a'. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character 'a'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
