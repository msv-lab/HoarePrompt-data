Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, where `prog_cities[i]` is now equal to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` and `forward` retain their initial values. The absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**
