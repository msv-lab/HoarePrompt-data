### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is correct in its implementation and meets the requirement of identifying palindromes.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from user input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints `'YES'`, `1`, and the original string `s`, and then exits.
     - This is correct because if `s` is not a palindrome, the entire string itself is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from the first character of `s`.
     - If all characters are the same, it prints `'NO'` and exits.
     - This is correct because if all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints `'YES'`, `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because if `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, then `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` form a valid partition.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it prints `'NO'` if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
     - This is incorrect because it does not always ensure that there is no valid partition. For example, if `s` is `"abccba"`, `x` would be 1, but the string can still be partitioned into `"abc"` and `"cba"`, which are both non-palindromic.
   - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints `'YES'`, `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is correct because it ensures that the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are non-palindromic.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` has a logical error in the condition where it prints `'NO'` if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is too restrictive and does not always correctly determine the absence of a valid partition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
