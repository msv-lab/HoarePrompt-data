Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the updated `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the updated `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cost` is updated by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its previous value.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `mu` remain unchanged.
- The updated `cost` is now equal to the previous `cost` plus the calculated expression.
