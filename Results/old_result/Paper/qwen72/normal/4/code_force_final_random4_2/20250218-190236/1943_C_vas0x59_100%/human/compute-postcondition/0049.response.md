The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ci` must still be such that `i` is less than `ci + 1`. Since `ci` is a non-negative integer, the condition `i < ci + 1` will still hold as long as `ci` is at least 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is a non-negative integer (the middle index of `path_ba`), `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops` now includes the tuple `(c, 0)`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, `c` is the middle node in the reversed path from `b` to `a`.**
