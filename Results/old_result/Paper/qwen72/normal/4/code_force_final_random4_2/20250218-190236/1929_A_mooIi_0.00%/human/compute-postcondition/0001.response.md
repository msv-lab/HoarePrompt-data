Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 0**. 

The value of `n` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must be greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
