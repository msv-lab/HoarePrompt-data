The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the first integer input. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`**
