Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed in their positions, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`. The elements at odd indices remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the list `a` has been modified by reversing the elements at even indices, while the value of `n` remains the same.
