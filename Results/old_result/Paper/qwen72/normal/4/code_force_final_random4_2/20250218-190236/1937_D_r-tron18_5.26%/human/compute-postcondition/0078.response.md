Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains `n - 3`.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `el` remains the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`.
- `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`.
- `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` remains `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `oneInd` remains `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
