The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where 0 <= `times` <= len(arr)). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`, where `l` is the length of `arr`. This means it calculates the difference between the last element and an element near the end of the list, depending on the value of `times`. If `times` is 0, it returns the difference between the last element and itself (which is 0). If `times` is greater than 0, it returns the difference between the last element and the element `times` positions before the last element.
