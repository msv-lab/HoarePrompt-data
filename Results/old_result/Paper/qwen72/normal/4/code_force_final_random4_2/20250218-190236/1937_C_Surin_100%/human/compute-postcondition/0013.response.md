Postcondition: ***`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', then the variables retain their initial values.***
