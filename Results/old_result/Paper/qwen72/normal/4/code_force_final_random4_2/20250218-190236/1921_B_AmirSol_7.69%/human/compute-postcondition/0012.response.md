Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 1, and the characters at index `i-1` in `s1` and `s2` are the same.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The characters at index `i-1` (which is 0) in `s1` and `s2` are still the same. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
