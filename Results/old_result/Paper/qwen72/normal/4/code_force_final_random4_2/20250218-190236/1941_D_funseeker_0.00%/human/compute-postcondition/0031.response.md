The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of the expression `(q + r) % n`.

- `q` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `temp` is an empty set before the code is executed.

The output state will include the updated `temp` set with the new element added, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, and the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.**
