Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, `i` remains 0, `work` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, `work` is True, and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`. If `work` is False, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.***
