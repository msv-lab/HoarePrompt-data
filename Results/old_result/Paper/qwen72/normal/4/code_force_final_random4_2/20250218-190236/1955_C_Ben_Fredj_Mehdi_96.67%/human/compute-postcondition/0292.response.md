The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. The parameters include `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here is the detailed description:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, representing the input list for each test case.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
