Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.***
