Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This statement is a bit confusing because it seems to be defining `t` in terms of itself. However, for the purpose of this task, we can ignore this as it does not directly affect the variables used in the print statement.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans + p2)`.

3. **Calculating `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This means `k` will be the smaller of the two values: `b - a + 1` or `n`.

4. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses: `b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1`.
   - So, `ans` becomes `(2b - k + 1) / 2 * k`.
   - This can be further simplified to `((2b - k + 1) * k) / 2`.

5. **Calculating `p2`:**
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

6. **Combining `ans` and `p2`:**
   - The final value to be printed is `ans + p2`.
   - Substituting the expressions for `ans` and `p2`:
     - `ans + p2 = ((2b - k + 1) * k) / 2 + (n - k) * a`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the sum of `ans` and `p2`.
   - Since `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` and `p2` are calculated based on this value, the exact numerical output depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **((2b - k + 1) * k) / 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of b - a + 1 and n, and n, a, and b are input integers)**
