Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`, `pos` is 0, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is equal to the value of `k`.**
