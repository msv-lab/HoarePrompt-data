The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply prints the constant value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
