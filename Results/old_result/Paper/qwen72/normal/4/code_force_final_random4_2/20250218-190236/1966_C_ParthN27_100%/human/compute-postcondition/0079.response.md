Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1. If `n` is 2, the program retains these conditions. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is updated to `n-2` and `ans` indicates the parity of the number of elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If `ans` is 1, it means the loop either broke early due to a difference greater than 1 or the number of such elements is odd. If `ans` is 0, the loop did not break early and the number of such elements is even.***
