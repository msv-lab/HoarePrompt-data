Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is `m - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input that were not in `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`, `done` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were initially in `todo`, `extra` is a set of integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not initially in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k` else `ans` is 0.** 

The value of `ans` is determined based on the length of the set `done`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
