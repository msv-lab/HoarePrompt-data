Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
- If `a` is 1, the previous value of `bx` was `max(x, -1)`, so `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and `max(x, -1)`, which simplifies to `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is 2, the previous value of `bx` was -1, so `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and -1.
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, the previous value of `bx` was -1, so `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and -1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, and `ax` remain unchanged.
