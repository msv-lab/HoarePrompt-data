Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `p` is equal to the first element of `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1), then `j` is set to 1, `q` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and `q` remains equal to the element in `l` at the index `p - 1`.**
