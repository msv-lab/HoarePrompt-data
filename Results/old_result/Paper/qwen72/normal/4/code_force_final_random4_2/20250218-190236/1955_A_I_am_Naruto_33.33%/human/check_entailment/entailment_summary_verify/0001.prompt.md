You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two values: `ans1` as `a * n` and `ans2` as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of yogurts) is greater than 1. This is necessary because the promotion only applies when buying two or more yogurts.
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints the price of one yogurt `a`, which is correct because there is no promotion to consider.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price `b` and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price `a`. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is even or odd by using the integer division `n // 2` and the modulus operator `n % 2`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case `2 5 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10` and `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`. The minimum is 9, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15` and `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`. The minimum is 14, which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15` and `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`. The minimum is 15, which is correct.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20` and `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`. The minimum is 20, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
