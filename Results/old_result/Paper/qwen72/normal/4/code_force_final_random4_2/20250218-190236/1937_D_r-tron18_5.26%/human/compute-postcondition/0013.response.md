Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except the last element which is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is '>', `ol` is 0, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is updated.
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged.
