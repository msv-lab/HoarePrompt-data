Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user. It then prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `b` and `c` have different parities, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q`, where `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a-1`, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` from the last test case. The variables `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationships (equal, less than, or greater than) and parities throughout the function execution. **
