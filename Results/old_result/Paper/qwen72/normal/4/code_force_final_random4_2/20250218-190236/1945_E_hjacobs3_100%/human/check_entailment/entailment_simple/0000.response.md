Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search on Permutation**: The problem statement mentions that the array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. However, binary search is typically used on sorted arrays. The program attempts to use binary search on an unsorted permutation, which is not guaranteed to work correctly without additional operations.

2. **Swapping Operations**: The program allows for up to 2 swapping operations to rearrange the permutation before performing the binary search. The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `array[l]` is equal to `x`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**: The binary search loop is implemented correctly. It initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively, and then repeatedly narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element `array[mid]` with `x`.

4. **Final Check**: After the binary search loop, the program checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints 1 and returns a list of two indices to swap. If `array[l]` is already equal to `x`, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.

5. **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic is designed to place `x` at the correct position `l` by swapping `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]`. This ensures that after the swap, `array[l]` will be `x`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than the first element or greater than the last element in the permutation. In such cases, the binary search will still correctly identify the position `l` where `x` should be placed.

7. **Output Format**: The output format is correct. It prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, as required by the problem statement.

However, there is a potential issue in the program:

- **Indexing Issue**: The binary search loop uses 0-based indexing for `l` and `r`, but the problem statement requires 1-based indexing for the output. The program correctly adjusts the indices by adding 1 when printing the result, but it should also ensure that the binary search loop and the final check are consistent with 0-based indexing.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its logic and handling of the problem requirements. The only minor issue is the consistency of indexing, but the program correctly adjusts for this in the output.

Correctness: **True**
