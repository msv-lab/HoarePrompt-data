### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is also correct.

3. **Stall Setup**:
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - The first element `n - k + 1` is the price of the first stall. This is chosen such that Alice can buy exactly `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
   - The second element `1` is the price of the second stall. This is chosen such that Alice can buy exactly 1 jewel from this stall.

4. **Greedy Buying**:
   - The program then iterates over the `costs` list and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought from each stall.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels bought.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`.
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and the stall setup with the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.

### Analysis:

- **Case 1: `n == k`**:
  - This is a straightforward case where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with a price of 1 coin. The program handles this correctly.

- **Case 2: `n < k`**:
  - This is also straightforward. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible. The program handles this correctly.

- **Case 3: `n > k`**:
  - The program sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
  - The first stall is designed such that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from it.
  - The second stall is designed such that Alice can buy exactly 1 jewel from it.
  - This setup ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in total, but it always prints 2 stalls, which is not always correct. For example, if `k` is 1, Alice can buy exactly 1 jewel from a single stall with a price of `n` coins. In this case, the program should print 1 stall, not 2.

### Issues:

- **Stall Count**:
  - The program always prints 2 stalls, which is not always the correct number of stalls. For example, if `k` is 1, Alice can buy exactly 1 jewel from a single stall with a price of `n` coins. In this case, the program should print 1 stall, not 2.
  - If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible for Bob to set up more than 60 stalls, so the program should print "NO".

- **Generalization**:
  - The program does not generalize well for all possible values of `k`. For example, if `k` is 3 and `n` is 7, the program sets up stalls with prices 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 and 1. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 2 jewels, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

- **General Solution**:
  - Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible for Bob to set up more than 60 stalls, so the program should print "NO".

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > 60:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(str(1) for _ in range(k)))
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible values of `k` and always prints 2 stalls, which is not always the correct number of stalls. The corrected program addresses these issues and provides the correct solution.

Final: **False**
