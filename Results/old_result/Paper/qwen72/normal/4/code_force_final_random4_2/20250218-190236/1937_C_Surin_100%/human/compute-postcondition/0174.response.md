Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. `prev` is 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
