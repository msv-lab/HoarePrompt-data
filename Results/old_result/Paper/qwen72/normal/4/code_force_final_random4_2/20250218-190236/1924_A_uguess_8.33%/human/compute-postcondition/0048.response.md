Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0, or `tmp` remains an empty string if all bits in `cur` are set to 1, `ans` is updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `k-1`.
- The value of `tmp` remains the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0, or it remains an empty string if all bits in `cur` are set to 1.
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to it. This means that `ans` now includes the original value of `ans` plus the additional 'a' characters.
