Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program always prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect. The program does not consider the actual numbers on the cards or the number of cards with each number. It should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `5 3`
- Cards: `4 1 1 4 4`

The correct output should be `2` because you can perform the operation once by choosing the three `4`s and exchanging them for two new cards, leaving you with `1 1` and the two new cards. However, the program will output `2` for any input with `k = 3`, regardless of the actual card numbers and their counts. This is clearly incorrect for many cases.

Another example:
- Input: `7 2`
- Cards: `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`

The correct output should be `1` because you can perform the operation multiple times to reduce the number of cards to one. However, the program will output `1` for any input with `k = 2`, which is not always correct.

The program fails to handle the logic of the problem correctly and does not consider the actual card numbers or the number of cards with each number. Therefore, it is incorrect.
