To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k` (or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`).
   - `high` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just greater than `k` (or the first index if all elements are less than or equal to `k`).
   - `st` is a set containing the indices that were checked during the binary search process.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible values of `low` and `pos`:

- **`pos` Value:**
  - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k`.
  - If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1.

- **`low` Value:**
  - `low` is the index of the element in `arr` that is just less than or equal to `k`.
  - If all elements in `arr` are greater than `k`, `low` is the last index of `arr` (i.e., `n-1`).
  - If all elements in `arr` are less than or equal to `k`, `low` is the first index of `arr` (i.e., 0).

Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it means that `k` is not found in `arr` or `k` is not exactly equal to `arr[low]` but `arr[low]` is the closest element less than or equal to `k`.

Now, let's consider the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement:

- **`low + 1`:**
  - If `k` is not found in `arr` or `k` is not exactly equal to `arr[low]`, `low` will be the index of the element just less than `k` or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`.
  - Adding 1 to `low` will give the position just after the element that is less than or equal to `k`.

- **`pos + 1`:**
  - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be the position just after `k`.
  - If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1, and `pos + 1` will be 0.

Given these conditions, the output will be:

- If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k`, and `low` will be the index of the element just less than or equal to `k`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will be -1, and `low` will be the index of the element just less than or equal to `k` or the last index if all elements are greater than `k`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where low is the index of the element just less than or equal to k, and pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k is found, otherwise pos is -1)**
