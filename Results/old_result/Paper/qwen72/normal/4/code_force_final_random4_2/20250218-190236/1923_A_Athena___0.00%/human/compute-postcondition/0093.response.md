To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`a`**: This is a list of integers where all leading zeros and trailing zeros have been removed. For example, if the original list was `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0]`, after removing leading and trailing zeros, `a` would be `[1, 2, 0, 3]`.

2. **`i`**: This is the length of the list `a` minus 1. If `a` has 4 elements (as in the example above), `i` would be `3`.

3. **`res`**: This is the number of zeros in the list `a` after leading and trailing zeros have been removed. In the example `[1, 2, 0, 3]`, there is 1 zero, so `res` would be `1`.

Given these definitions, the `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros in the list `a` after the leading and trailing zeros have been removed.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a` after leading and trailing zeros have been removed)**
