To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `result` step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
2. `t` is defined as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. This implies that `t` is initially some positive integer.
3. `v` is a list of integers input by the user. The length of `v` is at least 3, as we are accessing `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]`.
4. `result` is calculated as \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\).

### Calculation of `result`:
1. **Sum of the first three elements**: \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]\).
2. **Difference term**: \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\).
3. **Max function**: \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\). This function returns 0 if \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\) is negative, otherwise it returns \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\).
4. **Subtraction**: \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\).
5. **Integer division by 2**: The result of the subtraction is then divided by 2 using integer division.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Sum of the first three elements**: This is straightforward and is simply the sum of the first three elements of the list `v`.
2. **Difference term**: This term checks if \(v[2]\) is greater than the sum of \(v[0]\) and \(v[1]\). If it is, the term \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\) is positive, and \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\) will be \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\). If \(v[2]\) is less than or equal to the sum of \(v[0]\) and \(v[1]\), the term \(v[2] - v[0] - v[1]\) is negative or zero, and \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\) will be 0.
3. **Subtraction**: 
   - If \(v[2] \leq v[0] + v[1]\), then \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) = 0\), and the subtraction becomes \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - 0 = v[0] + v[1] + v[2]\).
   - If \(v[2] > v[0] + v[1]\), then \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) = v[2] - v[0] - v[1}\), and the subtraction becomes \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - (v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - v[2] + v[0] + v[1] = 2(v[0] + v[1])\).
4. **Integer division by 2**:
   - If \(v[2] \leq v[0] + v[1}\), then \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) // 2\).
   - If \(v[2] > v[0] + v[1}\), then \((2(v[0] + v[1])) // 2 = v[0] + v[1}\).

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will output the value of `result` based on the conditions described above. Since the exact values of `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the values of these elements.

Output: **result (where result is calculated as \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\))**
