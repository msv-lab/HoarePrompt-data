Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `water` is the third element in the list `a`, `container` is `2 * (water - target) + (water - target)`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` is greater than or equal to 0.***
