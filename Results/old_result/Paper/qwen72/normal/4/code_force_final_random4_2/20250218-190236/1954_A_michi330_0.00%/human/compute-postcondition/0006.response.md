Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `itest` is 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
   - `n` is greater than `k`.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions that must be true for the program to reach this print statement. However, these conditions do not affect the content of the print statement itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the print statement is a simple string literal, it will always print `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` as long as the program reaches this point.

Output: **Yes**
