Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 2 if `cnt` >= `n` or `i` is `k` if `cnt` < `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, and if `cnt` < `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it, followed by `n - cnt - 1` characters 'a'.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at the position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.), `cnt` remains unchanged unless `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
