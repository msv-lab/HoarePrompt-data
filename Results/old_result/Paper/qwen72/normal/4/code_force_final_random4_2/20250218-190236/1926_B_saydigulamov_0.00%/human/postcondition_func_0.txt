The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and then reads `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1' characters in each string that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `a` is 0, `i` is `a` (which is 0), and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1' characters for each input string that contained at least one '1' across all iterations.
