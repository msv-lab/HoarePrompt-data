Postcondition: ***`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007. `bx` remains -1 if `a` is 2 or not 1, otherwise `bx` is `max(x, -1)`.***
