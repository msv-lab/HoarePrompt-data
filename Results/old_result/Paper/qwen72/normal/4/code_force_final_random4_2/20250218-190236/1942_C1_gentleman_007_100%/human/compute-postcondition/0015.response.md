The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the next element in `graph[ver]`, and `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.

For the loop to execute again:
- The next `node` must be the next element in `graph[ver]`.
- `graph[ver]` must still have at least one more element.

State: **`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`**
