Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `b` is an integer input value, `c` is an integer input value, `i` is 1, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input value, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.**

Explanation:
- `d` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `e`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and the sum constraints for `n` and `m` are still valid.
- The values of `j` and `k` are still determined by the conditions provided in the initial state.
