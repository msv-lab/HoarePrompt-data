Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
     - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1.
     - If `r2` is not '<', `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `prev`:**
   - The value of `prev` depends on the input string `r`.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values of `prev`:**
   - `prev` can be either 0 or 1 based on the input strings `r` and `r2`.

5. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'? 2 2 {prev} {prev}'`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the first two values in the print statement are `2`.
   - The last two values are `prev`, which can be either 0 or 1.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `r` is '>', the output will be `'? 2 2 1 1'`.
   - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', the output will be `'? 2 2 1 1'`.
   - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is not '<', the output will be `'? 2 2 0 0'`.
   - If `r` is neither '>' nor '=', the output will be `'? 2 2 0 0'`.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **'? 2 2 {prev} {prev}' (where {prev} is 1 if `r` is '>' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', otherwise {prev} is 0)**
