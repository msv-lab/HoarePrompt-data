Output State: **`t` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a new input string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of the new `t`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in the new `s` and the string representation of the new `t` differ, and `_` is incremented by 1.**
