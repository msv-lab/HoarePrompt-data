Postcondition: ***`removals` must be greater than 0. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]` and `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`.***
