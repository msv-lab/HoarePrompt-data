You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It also initializes two sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that are already matched and elements that are not in `b`, respectively.

3. **First Window**:
   - The program checks the first subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each element in this subsegment, it checks if the element is in `todo`.
     - If it is, the element is moved from `todo` to `done`.
     - If it is not, the element is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and initializes `ans` accordingly.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check all subsegments of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (from position `m` to `n-1`), it updates the sets:
     - It removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`old`) from either `extra` or `done` and, if necessary, moves it back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element to `done` if it is in `todo`, otherwise, it adds it to `extra`.
   - After updating the sets, it checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if so.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
  - It correctly updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of the elements and their matches.
  - The logic for determining if a subsegment is good (i.e., if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`) is implemented correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (i.e., the entire array `a` is considered as a single subsegment).
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 1, which means any subsegment with at least one matching element is good.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, and check membership) are efficient, typically O(1) on average.
  - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. It correctly implements the sliding window approach and efficiently tracks the elements to determine the number of good subsegments.

### Correctness:
**True**
