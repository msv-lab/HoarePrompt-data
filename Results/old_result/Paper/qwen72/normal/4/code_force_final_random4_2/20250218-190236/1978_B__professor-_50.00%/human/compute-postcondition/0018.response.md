Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from the previous iteration), `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the condition `b - a < n` holds.***
