The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0 or 1.**
