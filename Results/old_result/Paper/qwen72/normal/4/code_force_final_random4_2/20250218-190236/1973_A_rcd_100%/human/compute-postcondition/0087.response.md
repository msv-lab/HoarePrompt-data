To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user.
   - The constraints are: 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `p1` and `p3` are directly used in the print statement.
   - `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` involves the subtraction of `x` from `p1` and then adding `p3`.
   - Without knowing the value of `x`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the expression.

Given the constraints and the lack of information about `x`, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, p3 is an integer such that p3 ≥ 4, and x is an undefined variable)**
