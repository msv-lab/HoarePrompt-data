Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, and `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
