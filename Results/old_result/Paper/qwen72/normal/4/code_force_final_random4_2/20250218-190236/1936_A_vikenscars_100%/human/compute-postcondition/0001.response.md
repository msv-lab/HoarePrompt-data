The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified by the range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0**
