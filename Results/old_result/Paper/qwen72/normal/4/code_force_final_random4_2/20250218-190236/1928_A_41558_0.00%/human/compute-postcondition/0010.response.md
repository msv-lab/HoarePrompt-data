Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input. Either `a` is even, or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even. If `a` is exactly half of `b` or `b` is exactly half of `a`, then this condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.***
