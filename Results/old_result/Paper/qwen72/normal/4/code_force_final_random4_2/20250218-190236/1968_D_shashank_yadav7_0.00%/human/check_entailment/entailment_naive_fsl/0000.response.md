Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

These lines are incorrect because they do not follow the rules of the game. According to the problem description, on each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in the array `a`, and then they can either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`. The program incorrectly adds a maximum value that seems to be a mix of the current score and the value at the new position, which does not match the game rules.

A correct implementation would involve updating the scores based on the current position and then deciding whether to stay or move based on the permutation. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        bodya_pos = b
        sasha_pos = s
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[bodya_pos]
            sasha_score += a[sasha_pos]
            
            # Decide whether to stay or move
            bodya_pos = p[bodya_pos] - 1
            sasha_pos = p[sasha_pos] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

This version correctly updates the scores based on the current position and then moves to the next position according to the permutation. The original program's logic for updating scores is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
