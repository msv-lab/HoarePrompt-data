Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
