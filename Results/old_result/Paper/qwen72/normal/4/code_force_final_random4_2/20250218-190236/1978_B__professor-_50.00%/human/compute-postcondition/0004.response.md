The code snippet `print(n * a)` will print the product of the variables `n` and `a`.

Based on the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and is less than or equal to `a`.
- `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not used in the print statement.

Since `n` and `a` are input integers, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. However, the print statement will output the result of multiplying `n` by `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are input integers)**
