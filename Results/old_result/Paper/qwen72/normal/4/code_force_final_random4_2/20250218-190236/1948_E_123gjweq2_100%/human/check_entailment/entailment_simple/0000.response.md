### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each one. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Clique Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of groups where each group can potentially form a clique.

3. **Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with zeros. This is correct as these arrays will be used to store the assigned integers and the clique assignments, respectively.

4. **Function `make_array` Calls:**
   - The program calls `make_array` in a loop, which is supposed to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values for each clique.
   - The function `make_array` is called with the correct arguments: `left` and `right` are calculated to ensure that each clique is processed correctly, and `clique` is the current clique number.

5. **Function `make_array` Logic:**
   - Inside `make_array`, the program calculates `small_element` and `big_element` to determine the range of integers to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - The program then divides the range into two parts, `mid` and `not_mid`, and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - The first loop assigns the smaller elements to the end of the current range, and the second loop assigns the larger elements to the start of the current range. This ensures that the values are distinct and within the range from 1 to `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the `arr` array, which should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The program prints the number of cliques, which is `cliques`.
   - The program prints the `cliquess` array, which should contain the clique assignments for each vertex.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where `k` is very large (e.g., `k >= n`). In such cases, the graph might be fully connected, and the program should still output a valid partition.
- **Clique Assignment:**
  - The program assumes that the cliques are formed by dividing the vertices into groups of size `k`. However, the problem states that the goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques. The current approach might not always achieve this minimum, especially for certain values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is generally correct for the problem description, but it might not always produce the minimum number of cliques, especially for edge cases where `k` is large. However, the program does produce a valid partition and meets the constraints of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is not guaranteed to produce the minimum number of cliques, which is a key requirement of the problem. For example, if `k` is large enough to make the graph fully connected, the program should output a single clique, but the current logic might not achieve this.
