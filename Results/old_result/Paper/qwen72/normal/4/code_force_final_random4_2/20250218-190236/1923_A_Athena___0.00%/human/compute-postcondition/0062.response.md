Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed. This means that any zeros that are present in `a` are only in the middle of the list.
   - `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a` after the leading and trailing zeros have been removed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed, the only zeros that remain in `a` are those that are not at the beginning or the end of the list.
   - Therefore, `res` will be the number of zeros that are present in the middle of the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of zeros in the list `a` after leading and trailing zeros have been removed)**
