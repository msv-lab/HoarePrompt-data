### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches, where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (cow `k`) with another cow once or choose to do nothing.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of Cowdeforces ratings `l`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list `l`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` as input.
   - It extracts the rating of our cow `x` from the list `a` at index `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of such cows.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and appends their indices to `ind`.
   - If no cows have a higher rating than `x`, it returns `n-1` (our cow wins all matches).
   - If only one cow has a higher rating than `x`:
     - If this cow is at index 0, it returns `k-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces this cow).
     - If this cow is after our cow, it returns `ind[0]-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces this cow).
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` (our cow wins all matches until it faces this cow) and `ind[0] - 1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces this cow, but we might swap it to a better position).
   - If two cows have higher ratings than `x`:
     - If the first cow is at index 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1]-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces the second cow) and `k-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces the first cow).
     - If our cow is after the second cow, it returns the maximum of `ind[0]-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces the first cow) and `ind[1] - ind[0]` (our cow wins all matches between the two higher-rated cows).
     - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0]-1` (our cow wins all matches until it faces the first cow) and `k - ind[0]` (our cow wins all matches until it faces the first cow, but we might swap it to a better position).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **No cows with higher ratings:**
     - If `ind` is empty, the program returns `n-1`, which is correct because our cow wins all matches.
   - **One cow with a higher rating:**
     - If the higher-rated cow is at index 0, the program returns `k-1`, which is correct because our cow wins all matches until it faces the first cow.
     - If the higher-rated cow is after our cow, the program returns `ind[0]-1`, which is correct because our cow wins all matches until it faces this cow.
     - If the higher-rated cow is before our cow, the program returns `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`, which is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve by either staying in its position or swapping to a better position.
   - **Two cows with higher ratings:**
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, the program returns `min(ind[1]-1, k-1)`, which is correct because it considers the minimum number of wins our cow can achieve by either staying in its position or swapping to a better position.
     - If our cow is after the second higher-rated cow, the program returns `max(ind[0]-1, ind[1] - ind[0])`, which is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve by either staying in its position or swapping to a better position.
     - If our cow is between the two higher-rated cows, the program returns `max(ind[0]-1, k - ind[0])`, which is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve by either staying in its position or swapping to a better position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
