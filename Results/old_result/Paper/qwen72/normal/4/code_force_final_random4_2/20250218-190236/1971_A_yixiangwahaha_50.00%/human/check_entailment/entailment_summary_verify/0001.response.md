### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
   - However, the program does not use `t` in any meaningful way. Instead, it assumes that there are always 10 test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description where `t` can vary from 1 to 100.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program uses a fixed loop `for i in range(10)` to read 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`. This will cause issues if `t` is not exactly 10.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`.

3. **Output**:
   - After reading the inputs, the program uses another fixed loop `for i in range(10)` to process and print the results.
   - For each pair `(x[i], y[i])`, it prints the minimum and maximum values in the correct order.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the number of test cases `t`. It always reads and processes 10 test cases, which is incorrect if `t` is not 10.
- The program should use `t` to determine the number of test cases to read and process.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 100).
- It then reads 10 pairs of integers (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the input, storing them in two lists `x` and `y`.
- For each of the 10 pairs, the function prints the two integers in ascending order.
- The function does not return any value.
- After the function concludes, the lists `x` and `y` contain the 10 pairs of integers, and the input `t` remains unchanged.

### Evaluation:
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func` as it is currently implemented.
- However, the function summary does not reflect the correct behavior as per the problem description, which requires the program to handle a variable number of test cases `t`.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases `t` properly.
- The program will fail if the number of test cases is not exactly 10.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
