Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0, and `temp` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between the first element of `a` (which is `a[0]`) and the first element of `b` (which is `b[0]`) to the list `ans`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
