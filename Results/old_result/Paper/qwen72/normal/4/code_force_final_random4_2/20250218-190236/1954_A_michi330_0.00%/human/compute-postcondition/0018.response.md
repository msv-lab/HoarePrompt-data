Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `itest` is `t`, and for each test case from 0 to `t-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` were input integers. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than `k`, the output was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output was 'Yes'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 0. The loop index `itest` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has finished running. For each test case from 0 to `t-1`, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` were read as input integers, and the loop checked the condition for each test case. If the condition `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` was true for a test case, the output for that test case was 'NO'. Otherwise, the output for that test case was 'Yes'.
