Output State: **`N` is greater than `R[0] + 2`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[0] + 3`, `cur` remains 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `R[0] + 3`.
- Since `i` was initially `R[0] + 2` and is now `R[0] + 3`, it is not equal to `R[cur]` (which is `R[1]`).
- Therefore, `cur` remains 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
