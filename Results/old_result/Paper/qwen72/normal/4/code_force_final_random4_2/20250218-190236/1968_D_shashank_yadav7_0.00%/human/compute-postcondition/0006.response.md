Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `s` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is `s - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
