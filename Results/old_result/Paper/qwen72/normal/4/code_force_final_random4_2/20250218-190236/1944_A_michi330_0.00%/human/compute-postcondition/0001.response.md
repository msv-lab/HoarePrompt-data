The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
