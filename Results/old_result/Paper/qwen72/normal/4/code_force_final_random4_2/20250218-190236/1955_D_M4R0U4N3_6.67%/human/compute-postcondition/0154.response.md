Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`**
