Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a'. `cur` is 0. `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. The other variables `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.
