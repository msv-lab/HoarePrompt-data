Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = [0] + s` adds a 0 at the beginning of the list `s`.
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.
- After adding 0 to the beginning of `s`, the new list `s` will have an additional element at the start, making it a list with `n + 1` elements.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
