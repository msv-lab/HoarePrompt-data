Output State: **`index` is `5 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[5 + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `index` has been incremented by `2 * q` because the loop increments `index` by 2 for each of the `q` iterations.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is defined based on the initial state and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `pf` also remains unchanged as it is derived from `a` and is not modified within the loop.
- The dictionary `mp` remains unchanged as it is derived from `pf` and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is defined in the initial state and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains `n + 1` as it is defined in the initial state and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `q` remains greater than 0, but the loop has completed `q` iterations.
- The list `results` contains a string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each of the `q` iterations, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop body were met for each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, the loop checks if the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` is zero or if there exist indices in `mp` that satisfy certain conditions, and appends `'YES'` or `'NO'` to `results` accordingly.
