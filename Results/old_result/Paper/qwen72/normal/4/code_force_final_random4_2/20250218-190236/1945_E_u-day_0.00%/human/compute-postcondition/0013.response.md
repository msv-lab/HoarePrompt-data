Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially, indicating the size of the list `arr`.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`.
- The variable `k` is still the value returned by `func_1()`, which was set at the beginning.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged, containing the permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- The variable `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1.
