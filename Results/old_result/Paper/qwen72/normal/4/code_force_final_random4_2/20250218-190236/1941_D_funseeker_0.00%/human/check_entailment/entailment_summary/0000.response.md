Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the possible positions of a ball after a series of throws in a circle of players. The functions are structured to handle input and process the game's logic correctly. Let's break down the reasoning for each function:

1. **`func_1`**: This function reads a single line from the standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. It is used to read input lines one by one, which is appropriate for the problem's input format.

2. **`func_2`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer. This is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

3. **`func_3`**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case. This is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

4. **`func_4`**: This function processes each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. For each of the `m` throws, it updates the set `ans` based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or the possibility of both directions if `c` is '?'). The function correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure that the player indices wrap around the circle. After all throws, it ensures that the player index `0` is converted to `n` if it appears in the set, and then prints the number of possible players and the players themselves.

The logic in `func_4` is correct:
- It correctly updates the set of possible positions for each throw.
- It handles the modulo operation to wrap around the circle.
- It correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown by considering both possible directions.
- It ensures that the player index `0` is converted to `n` if it appears in the set, which is necessary because player indices are 1-based.

Given that all functions are correctly implemented and the program follows the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
