Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, the condition `m < a or m < b` holds. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers.
   - `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`.
   - `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`.
   - `2` is a constant integer.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, the condition `m < a or m < b` holds.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the condition `m < a or m < b` does not hold.

3. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will be evaluated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, `m // a` and `m // b` will be 0 because integer division of a smaller number by a larger number results in 0.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, `m // a` and `m // b` will be the integer quotients of `m` divided by `a` and `b` respectively.

### Final Output:
- If `m` is less than `a` or less than `b`, the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` simplifies to `0 + 0 + 2`, which is 2.
- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will be the sum of the integer quotients of `m` divided by `a` and `b`, plus 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2 (if m is less than a or less than b) or (m // a + m // b + 2) (if m is greater than or equal to both a and b)**
