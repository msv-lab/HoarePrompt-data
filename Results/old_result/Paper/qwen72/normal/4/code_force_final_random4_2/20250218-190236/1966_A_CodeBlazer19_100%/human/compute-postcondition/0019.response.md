Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**

The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `l` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `p`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding the maximum value in `p` and its relationship to `k` is still valid, but `l` now contains the new list of integers.
