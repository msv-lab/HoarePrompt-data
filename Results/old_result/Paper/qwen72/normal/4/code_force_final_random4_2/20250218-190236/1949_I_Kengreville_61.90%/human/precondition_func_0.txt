n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where each list has length n. For each i in range(n), x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized to False, 0, and 1 respectively. nodes is an empty list.
