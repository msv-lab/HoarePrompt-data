Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The value of `q` is the next element in the list `ans`.
- The value of `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- The value of `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- If `c` is '?', this code snippet adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`, in addition to the previously added `(q + r) % n`.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than `m` for the loop to continue executing.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The state of `ans` remains unchanged, but `q` is now the next element in `ans`.
- The set `temp` now contains the element `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?'.
