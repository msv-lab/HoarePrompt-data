Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1, or `j + 1` if the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`**: These variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be the index at which the loop breaks, or it will be `b` if the loop completes without breaking.
- **`k`**: `k` will be the index of the last matching element in `e` plus 1, or `j + 1` if the loop breaks due to `k` reaching `c` or `j` reaching `b - 1`.

This means that the loop will continue to execute until it either finds a match in `e` that causes `k` to reach `c` or `j` to reach `b - 1`, or it finds an element in `d` that is not in `e[k:]`, at which point it will break out of the loop. The final value of `k` will reflect the last successful match or the point where the loop broke.
