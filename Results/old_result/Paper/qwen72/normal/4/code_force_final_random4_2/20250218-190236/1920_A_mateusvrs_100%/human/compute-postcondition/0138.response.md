Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop and must have at least 2 integers, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the second integer in `cx`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Initially, `tmp` could be either 0 or 1 based on the conditions provided in the initial state. After the increment, `tmp` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
