Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` to be a new list of integers provided by the user, where the input is split by whitespace and each element is converted to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged, but `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is still `len(a) - 1` because it is defined based on the length of `a`.
- `res` is still the number of zeros in the list `a`, but the list `a` has been updated, so `res` will be recalculated based on the new list `a`.
