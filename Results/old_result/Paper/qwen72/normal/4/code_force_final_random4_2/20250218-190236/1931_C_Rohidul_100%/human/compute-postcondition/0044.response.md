Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the first element of `a` must be equal to the second element of `a`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 4`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, and `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
