Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (i.e., `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`), and additional elements for each `i` from `temp` to `n-1` where each element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a valid index (0 ≤ temp < n).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain the initial absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` (from the initial state), followed by the absolute differences between each element of `a` from index `temp` to `n-1` and the corresponding element of `b` in reverse order. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, and `temp` will still be a valid index within the range of `a`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
