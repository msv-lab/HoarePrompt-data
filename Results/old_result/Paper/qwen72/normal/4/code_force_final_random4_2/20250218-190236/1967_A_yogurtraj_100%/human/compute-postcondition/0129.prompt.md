Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i initially available. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` remains not 0. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is the index at which the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` at the point where the loop breaks, `k` is 0 or the remaining value of `k` after the loop completes, and `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks. If `k` is non-zero, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` at the point where the loop breaks, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `k` is not 0, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[n-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
