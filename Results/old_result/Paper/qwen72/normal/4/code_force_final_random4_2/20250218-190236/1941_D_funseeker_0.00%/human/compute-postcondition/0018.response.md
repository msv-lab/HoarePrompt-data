The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which is an element of the set `ans`. For the loop to execute one more time, the set `ans` must contain at least one more element in addition to the current `q`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a set containing at least one more integer in addition to `x`. The variable `q` is the current element being iterated over in `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `ans` will be the new `q`. Since `ans` contains at least one more integer, the next `q` will be the next integer in the set.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is a set containing at least one more integer in addition to `x`. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the integers `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains a set containing the integer `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next integer in the set `ans`.**
