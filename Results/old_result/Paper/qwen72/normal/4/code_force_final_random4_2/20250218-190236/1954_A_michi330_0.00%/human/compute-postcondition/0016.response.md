Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `itest` is 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- There are two conditions:
  1. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true.
  2. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Yes')` statement is inside a block of code that is executed based on the conditions provided.
- The conditions are structured as an "if-else" statement, but the code snippet only shows the `print('Yes')` statement, which implies that the conditions are true.

### Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.
   - If either of these sub-conditions is true, the overall condition is true.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition is true.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the condition is true.

2. **Condition 2**: `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - This condition is the negation of Condition 1.
   - If both `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is true.

### Conclusion:
- Since the `print('Yes')` statement is executed, it means that the conditions are true.
- Therefore, either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`.

### Final Output:
The `print('Yes')` statement will print the string "Yes" because the conditions provided in the initial state are true.
Output: **Yes**
