Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1, `first` is True. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
