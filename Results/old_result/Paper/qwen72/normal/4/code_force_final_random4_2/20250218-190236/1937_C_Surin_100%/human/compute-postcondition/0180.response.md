Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - The current value of `r` is '='.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The `print` statement will format the string using the values of `i` and `prev`.
   - The string will be `'? 1 1 0 0'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 1 1 0 0**
