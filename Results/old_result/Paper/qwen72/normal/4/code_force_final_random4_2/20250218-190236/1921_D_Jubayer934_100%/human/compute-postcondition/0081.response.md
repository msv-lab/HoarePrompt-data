Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
