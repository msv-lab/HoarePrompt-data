Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.***
