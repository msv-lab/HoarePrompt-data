Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 1, and `temp` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
