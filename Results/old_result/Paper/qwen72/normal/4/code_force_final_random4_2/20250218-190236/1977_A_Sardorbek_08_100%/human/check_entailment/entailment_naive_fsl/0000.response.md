Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than `m`, it should always output "No" because Nikita cannot make more moves than the number of cubes he wants to end up with. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. For example, if the input is `2 3`, the program will output "Yes" instead of "No". 

Additionally, the program has a minor issue with the output format. The problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive), but the program outputs "YES" and "No" with inconsistent capitalization. This should be standardized to either all uppercase or all lowercase to match the problem description. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('No')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
This version correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m` and ensures consistent output formatting.
