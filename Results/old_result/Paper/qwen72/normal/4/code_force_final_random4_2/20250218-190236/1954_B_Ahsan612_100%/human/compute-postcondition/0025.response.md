To ensure the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(ar)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

From the given state:
- `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4.
- `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` can either be 3 or 4, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 4 to guarantee that the loop condition `i < len(ar)` holds true in both cases.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(ar)` is greater than 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `len(ar)` is greater than 4, `i` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4, `minn` is set to infinity if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is updated to `ar[2]` if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or `num` is updated to `ar[3]` if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1**
