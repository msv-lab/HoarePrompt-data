Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n`, `b` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is the initial value of `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times), `bm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `sp` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `bp` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks and the final state is determined at that point. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program follows the if part. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the program follows the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is the first input integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is the second input integer minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations, `s` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[s] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations, `bm` is the initial value of `a[b] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the initial value of `a[s] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial value of `a[s]` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the initial value of `a[b]` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `k` is 0 at any point, the loop breaks and the final state reflects the values at that point. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
