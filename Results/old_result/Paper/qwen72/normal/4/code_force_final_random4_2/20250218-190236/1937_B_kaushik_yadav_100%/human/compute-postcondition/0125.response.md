Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 characters, and the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`.**
