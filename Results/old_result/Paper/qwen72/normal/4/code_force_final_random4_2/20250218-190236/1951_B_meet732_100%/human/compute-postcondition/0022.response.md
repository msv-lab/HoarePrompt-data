Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `i` is 2. `n` is at least 3. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `c` is 4. If `c` is not 2, `ind` contains only the integer 1, and `c` remains 1 or 2.***
