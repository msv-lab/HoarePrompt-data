Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial and final configurations of cats in the boxes are the same, but there are multiple '1's in the strings. According to the problem description, if the initial and final configurations are the same, the output should be 0. However, the current implementation of `func_1` may incorrectly count operations in such cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3
110
110
```
The initial and final configurations are the same, so the correct output should be 0. However, the program will output 1 because it incorrectly increments the counter when it encounters the first '1' in `s1` and `s2` that are the same.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where no operations are needed, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
