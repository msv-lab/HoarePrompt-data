The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples. Each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates (x_i, y_i) are within the range -1000 to 1000, and the number of test cases t is between 1 and 100. Each test case guarantees the existence of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the area of each square for the given test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of each square, ensuring the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and the area is positive.**
