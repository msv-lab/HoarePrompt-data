Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
     - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
   - If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `v1` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `v1` is a positive integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` is determined by the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - `v1` is `n - 1`, which is a positive integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` can be either 0 or 2 based on the value of `r` and `r2`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- If `r` is '>', the output will be `? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 2`.
- If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', the output will be `? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 2`.
- In all other cases, the output will be `? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 0`.

Since the exact value of `r` and `r2` is not provided, we need to consider all possible scenarios.

Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [prev] (where [n-1] is the value of `n - 1` and [prev] is 0 if `r` is not '>', and not '=', or 2 if `r` is '>', or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<')**
