### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` reads the integer \( X \) and initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences.
   - It also initializes a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length of the subsequences.
   - If \( X \) is 2, it prints 1 and 0, which is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and the empty subsequence.
   - The program then enters a loop to decompose \( X \) into powers of 2. This is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each \( X \), it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( X \) and subtracts it from \( X \). It appends the exponent of this power to `subseq_lens`.
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 0.
   - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1` (where `mx` is the maximum exponent found).
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic of decomposing \( X \) into powers of 2 is correct. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the sum of powers of 2.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` is also correct. The array is built such that it contains unique elements from 0 to `mx-1` and then the elements from `subseq_lens` to ensure the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program handles the special case \( X = 2 \) correctly by printing a single element array [0].

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently.
   - The program should ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200. Given the constraints and the way the array is constructed, the length should not exceed 200 for any valid \( X \).

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem statement specifies that \( X \) is at least 2, so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, the construction method ensures that the length will not exceed 200 for any valid \( X \).

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and constructs the array `ansv` based on the decomposition of \( X \) into powers of 2.
   - The final state of the program ensures that `ansv` is constructed correctly and printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented. It correctly decomposes \( X \) into powers of 2 and constructs the array to match the number of increasing subsequences. The special case \( X = 2 \) is handled correctly, and the array length does not exceed 200 for any valid \( X \).

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
