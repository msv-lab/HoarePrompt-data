Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the integer values of the characters are not equal, `flag` is 0, indicating there are no pairs of adjacent characters in `s` where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character. `i` is `len(s) - 2`.**
