Functionality: ** The function `func_22` accepts two non-empty lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a string representing the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b`, with the elements of the LCS converted to strings and concatenated in reverse order. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. **
