Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly considering all possible scenarios for optimal swapping.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
```
Here, `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the ratings are `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.

- The initial position of cow `k` (with rating 30) is 3.
- The program should determine the optimal swap to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

The correct output should be `2` because:
- If we do nothing, cow `k` will win 1 match (against the cow with rating 20) and then lose to the cow with rating 40.
- If we swap cow `k` with the cow in position 2 (rating 20), the new order will be `[10, 30, 40, 50, 20]`.
- Cow `k` will win 2 matches (against the cows with ratings 10 and 40) and then lose to the cow with rating 50.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it incorrectly handles the logic for determining the optimal swap and the number of wins.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the number of wins cow `k` can achieve without swapping.
2. Consider the optimal swap to maximize the number of wins.
3. Return the maximum number of wins between the two scenarios.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
