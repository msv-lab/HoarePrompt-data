Output State: **`v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `_` is 2, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])` and must be greater than 2, `l` is `int(data[index])`, `r` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 6`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[r]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. If `x` is 0, 'YES' is appended to `results` and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `v1 = mp[pf[r]]` assigns the value of `mp[pf[r]]` to `v1`.
- Since `v1` was already `mp[pf[r]]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `v1`.
- The values of `_`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged.
- The condition for appending 'YES' to `results` and continuing to the next iteration is still dependent on the value of `x` being 0, which is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
