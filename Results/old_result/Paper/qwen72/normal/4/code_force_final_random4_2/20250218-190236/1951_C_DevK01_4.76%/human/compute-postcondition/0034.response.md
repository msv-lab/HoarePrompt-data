Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is equal to `mu * w`, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the length of the list `N`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, `cost`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
