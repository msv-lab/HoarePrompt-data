Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi` (and has been decreased by `2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`), `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi` (or `0 - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[l]` was 0), `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi` (or `a[r] - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` was not 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `l` is updated to 2 or 3. If `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k` and `mi - (k % 2) - (k // 2) == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains undefined.***
