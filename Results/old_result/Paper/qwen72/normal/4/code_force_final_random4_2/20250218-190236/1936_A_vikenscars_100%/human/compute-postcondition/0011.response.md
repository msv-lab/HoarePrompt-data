Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 3, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, and `max_item_idx` is either 2 or 0 depending on the initial value of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `i` remains 3 as it is not modified by the code.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
- The value of `max_item_idx` remains either 2 or 0, depending on the initial condition of `ans`. If `ans` was initially '<', `max_item_idx` is 2. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` is 0.
