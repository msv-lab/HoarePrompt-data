Postcondition: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - k` if `m` is 0 and `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `m` is `n - k` if `m` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers with the specified values if `m` is not 1, and `c` is equal to `r`.**
