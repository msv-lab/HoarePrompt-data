Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in the list `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in the set `done`, `old` is added to the set `todo` and removed from the list `done`. Otherwise, the variables and list `a` remain unchanged.***
