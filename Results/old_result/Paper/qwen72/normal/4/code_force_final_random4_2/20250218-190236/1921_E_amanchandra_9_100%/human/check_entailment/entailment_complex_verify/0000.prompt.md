You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where the input is provided in the form of multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The integers satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The function should handle the input and output as described in the problem statement.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a` > `c`, the variables retain their initial values. If `a` ≤ `c`, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. The function then determines and prints the outcome of a game based on the values of these integers. If `a` is greater than `c`, it prints 'Draw'. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, it calculates `x` as the integer division of `abs(a - c)` by 2. Depending on whether `abs(a - c)` is odd or even, it further calculates `l` and `r` and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on specific conditions involving `l`, `r`, `b`, and `d`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the input variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` being in their final states as determined by the input and the conditions within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 10 1 6 10 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
In this test case, Alice starts at (1, 6) and Bob starts at (10, 8). Alice can move her chip to (2, 5), (2, 6), or (2, 7). Bob can move his chip to (9, 7), (9, 8), or (9, 9). If Alice moves to (2, 7), Bob can move to (9, 7). Alice can then move to (3, 6), (3, 7), or (3, 8). Bob can move to (8, 6), (8, 7), or (8, 8). If Alice moves to (3, 8), Bob can move to (8, 8). Alice can then move to (4, 7), (4, 8), or (4, 9). Bob can move to (7, 7), (7, 8), or (7, 9). If Alice moves to (4, 9), Bob can move to (7, 9). Alice can then move to (5, 8), (5, 9), or (5, 10). Bob can move to (6, 8), (6, 9), or (6, 10). If Alice moves to (5, 10), Bob can move to (6, 10). Alice can then move to (6, 9), (6, 10), or (6, 11). Bob can move to (5, 9), (5, 10), or (5, 11). If Alice moves to (6, 10), Bob can move to (5, 10), and Alice wins because she can move to (7, 9), (7, 10), or (7, 11) on her next turn, and Bob cannot move to (7, 10) without losing.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case. The logic in the program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and the optimal moves for both players, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
