The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and two strings `s` and `f`, both of length `n`, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the integer `n` is constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two strings `s` and `f` of length `n`, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two strings `s` and `f` of length `n`, and returns a result for each test case.**
