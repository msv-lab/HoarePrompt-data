Output State: **`index` is `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + i - 1])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `i` is `n`, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`index`**: After the loop completes, `index` will be `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + n`. This is because `index` starts at `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q` and is incremented by 1 for each of the `n` iterations of the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` will have its first `n` elements filled with the integers from the `data` list starting at the initial `index` and continuing for `n` elements. The rest of the list will remain zeros.
- **`pf`**: The list `pf` will have its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that index. For example, `pf[1]` will be `a[1]`, `pf[2]` will be `a[1] ^ a[2]`, and so on.
- **`mp`**: The `defaultdict` `mp` will have keys corresponding to the values in `pf`, and each key will map to a list of indices where that value appears in `pf`. For example, `mp[0]` will still contain `[0, 0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` will contain `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the last index processed in the loop.
- **`q`**: The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.
- **`results`**: The `results` list will contain the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body.
- **`_`**: The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1 after the loop completes, and it must still be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
