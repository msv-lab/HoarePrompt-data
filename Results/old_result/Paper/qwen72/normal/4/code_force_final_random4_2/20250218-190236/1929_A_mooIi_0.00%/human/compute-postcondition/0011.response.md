Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) from 1 to `n`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input list `a`.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(ar))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The list `a` contains `n` integers, each within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - The map object `ar` is created by applying the `str` function to each element of the sorted list `a`. This means `ar` contains the string representations of the integers in `a` in ascending order.
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of the map object `ar` with a space (' ') and prints the resulting string.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from `a`, the `print` statement will output these strings separated by spaces.
   - The exact values of the integers in `a` are not provided, but we know they are sorted and converted to strings.

Therefore, the output will be the sorted integers from the list `a`, each converted to a string and separated by spaces.

Output: **sorted integers from the list `a` (each converted to a string and separated by spaces)**
