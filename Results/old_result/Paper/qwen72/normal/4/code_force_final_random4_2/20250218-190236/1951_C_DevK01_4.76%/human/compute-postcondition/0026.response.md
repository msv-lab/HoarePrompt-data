Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the updated `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

Explanation:
- The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, `cost`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state is updated to reflect that `M` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
