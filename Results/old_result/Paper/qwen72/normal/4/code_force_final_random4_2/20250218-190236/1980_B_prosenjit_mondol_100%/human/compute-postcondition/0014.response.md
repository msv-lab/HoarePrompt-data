Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is `f - 1`, `k` is an integer provided by the input minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `a`, and the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the integer at index `k` of the list `a` is exactly equal to `x`.***
