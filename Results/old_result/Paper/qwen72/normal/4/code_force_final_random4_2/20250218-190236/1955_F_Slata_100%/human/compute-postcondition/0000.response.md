The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function. The state of `t` and `p_i` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
