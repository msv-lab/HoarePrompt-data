### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`. This is a valid and efficient way to determine how many times each element appears in the array.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob are building.
   - It checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` object `mpp`. If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not in the array `arr`, and thus, it is the MEX. The program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its frequency is 1, the program checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it means that a previous element with frequency 1 has already been encountered, and the current element `i` is the MEX. The program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its frequency is 1, and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This indicates that the first element with frequency 1 has been encountered.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic of the program is designed to simulate the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in the array, which is the MEX. If there is an integer with a frequency of 1, it ensures that it is considered as the MEX if it is encountered after another integer with a frequency of 1, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array `arr` might contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` exactly once, in which case the MEX would be `n`.
   - It also handles the case where the array `arr` might contain duplicates, ensuring that the MEX is correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob build, considering their optimal strategies. The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
