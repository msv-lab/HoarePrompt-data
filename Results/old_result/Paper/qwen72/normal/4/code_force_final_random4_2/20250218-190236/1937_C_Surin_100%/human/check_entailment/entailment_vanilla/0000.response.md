### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries, where each query provides a comparison between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \(v1\) such that \(p_{v1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is done by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_0\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - The query `"? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}"` is used to compare \(p_{v1}\) with \(p_i\). If \(p_i\) is greater, \(v1\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - Once \(v1\) is determined, the program then tries to find the index \(prev\) such that \(p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1}\) is maximized.
   - The program iterates over all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), \(prev\) is updated to \(i\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), the program makes an additional query to compare \(p_i\) with \(p_{prev}\) directly.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop to find \(v1\) makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop to find \(prev\) makes up to \(2(n-1)\) queries (one for each comparison and potentially one more for the equality check).
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(n-1 + 2(n-1) = 3n - 3\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\) queries.

5. **Output and Flushing:**
   - The program correctly prints the queries and the final answer in the required format.
   - It also flushes the output after each query and the final answer, ensuring that the interactor receives the input in a timely manner.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it adheres to the query limit and interaction rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
