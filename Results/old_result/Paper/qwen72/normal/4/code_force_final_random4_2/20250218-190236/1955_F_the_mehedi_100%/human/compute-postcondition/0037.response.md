Output State: **`_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third element in `a`**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` updates the value of `cnt` by adding the floor division of `x` by 2 to its current value. The value of `x` is the third element in the list `a`. The values of `_` and `a` remain unchanged. The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`.
