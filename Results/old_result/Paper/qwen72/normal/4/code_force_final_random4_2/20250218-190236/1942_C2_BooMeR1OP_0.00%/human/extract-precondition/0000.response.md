Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of sides of the polygon (n), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x), the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y), and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where t is the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, and chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
