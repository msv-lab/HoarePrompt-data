Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.***
