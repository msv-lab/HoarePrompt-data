The code snippet `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. The new value is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` (denoted as `suffZero[-1]`), the value of `i`, and 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5
- `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`

The value of `i` is `n - 3`, and the new element appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5
- `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`
- `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`

Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the sequence `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended, which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`.**
