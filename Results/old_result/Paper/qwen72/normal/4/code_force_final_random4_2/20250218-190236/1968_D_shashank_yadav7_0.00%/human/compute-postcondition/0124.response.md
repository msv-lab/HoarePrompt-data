The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is now `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(0, a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp)` if `bm` is less than `a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp`, otherwise `bm` remains unchanged, `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `sm` is less than `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp`, otherwise `sm` remains unchanged, `sp` is now `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`**
