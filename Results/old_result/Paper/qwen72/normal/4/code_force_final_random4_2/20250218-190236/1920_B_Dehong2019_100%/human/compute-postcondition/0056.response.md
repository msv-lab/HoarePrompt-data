Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 2, `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1 + a[1]` and the original `ans2`, and `ans1` is now equal to the original `ans1` plus `a[2]`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is now equal to the original `ans1` plus `a[2]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is now equal to the original `ans1` plus `a[2]`.** 

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is increased by the value of `a[2]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its new value. Otherwise, `ans1` remains as the original `ans1` plus `a[2]`.
