### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is a helper function that assigns values to the vertices and determines the clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the starting index, ending index, and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It assigns values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and the number of elements not in the middle `not_mid`.
   - It fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays accordingly:
     - For the first half of the range, it assigns increasing values from `small_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.
     - For the second half of the range, it assigns decreasing values from `big_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.
   - **Vertex Assignment:**
     - The `make_array` function ensures that the values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range [1, n]. However, there is a potential issue with the way the values are assigned. Specifically, the values are assigned in a way that may not ensure the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is always met.
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - **Edge Condition:**
     - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The way vertices are assigned and partitioned into cliques should ensure that this condition is met, but the current implementation may not always do so. For example, if `k` is small, the values assigned to vertices in different cliques may not satisfy the edge condition, leading to incorrect results.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format. However, the correctness of the output depends on the edge condition being met.

### Detailed Analysis of `make_array` Function:
- The function `make_array` assigns values to the vertices in a specific pattern:
  - For the first half, it assigns increasing values.
  - For the second half, it assigns decreasing values.
- This pattern ensures that the values are distinct and within the range [1, n], but it does not necessarily ensure that the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - Output: `2 1`, `1`, `1 1`
  - The edge condition \( |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2 \le 3 \) is met, so this is correct.
- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 5`, `k = 4`
  - Output: `3 1 5 2 4`, `2`, `1 1 2 1 2`
  - The edge condition \( |1 - 2| + |3 - 1| = 3 \le 4 \) is met.
  - The edge condition \( |1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 5 \not\le 4 \) is not met, which means the vertices 1 and 3 should not be in the same clique. This is incorrect.
- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `k = 16`
  - Output: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`, `1`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 16 \) is always met because \( k \) is large enough. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always ensure that the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when `k` is small. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
