The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `max_item_idx` is 0 if `ans` is not '<'. If `ans` is '<', `max_item_idx` is 1 and `ans` remains the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**
