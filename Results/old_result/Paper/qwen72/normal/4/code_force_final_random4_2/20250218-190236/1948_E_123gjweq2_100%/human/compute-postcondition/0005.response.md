Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is assigned the value `small_element`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i` modifies the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid - i - 1`.
- Given that `i` is 0, the index becomes `left + mid - 1`.
- The value assigned to this index is `small_element + 0`, which is simply `small_element`.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` >= 1, and `mid` is greater than 0, still holds true.
