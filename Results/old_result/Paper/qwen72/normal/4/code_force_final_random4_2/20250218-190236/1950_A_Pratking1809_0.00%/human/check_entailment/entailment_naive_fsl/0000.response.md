Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both conditions for a stair and a peak are met, which is logically impossible but the program does not explicitly check for this. However, the main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case where neither condition is met. Specifically, the program will print 'NONE' if the first condition (a < b < c) is not met, even if the second condition (a < b > c) is true. This can be seen in the following example:

Input:
```
1
3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
PEAK
```

Actual Output:
```
NONE
```

The program should check both conditions and only print 'NONE' if neither condition is satisfied. The current implementation prints 'NONE' after checking the first condition, which can lead to incorrect output if the second condition is true but the first is false.
