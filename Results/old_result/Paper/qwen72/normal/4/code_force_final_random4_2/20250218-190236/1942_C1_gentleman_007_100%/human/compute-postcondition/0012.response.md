Output State: **`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed and `node` appended to the right, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`**

Explanation: The code appends `node` to the right end of the deque `q`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
