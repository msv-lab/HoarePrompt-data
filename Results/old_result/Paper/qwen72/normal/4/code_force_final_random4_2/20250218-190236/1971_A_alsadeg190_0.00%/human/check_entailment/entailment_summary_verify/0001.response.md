Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is appropriate for processing the specified number of test cases.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `x` is greater than `y` and prints the integers in the order `x, y` if `x` is greater, and `y, x` otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect because the problem description requires the minimum of `x` and `y` to be printed first, followed by the maximum. The current logic prints the maximum first and the minimum second when `x` is greater than `y`.

5. **Correct Output**: The correct output should be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The program should use `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))` to ensure the correct order.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic for the problem.

Final: **False**
