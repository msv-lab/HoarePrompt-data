The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints the integers 1 and 0, each on a new line, and then returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` of integers such that the list has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` on a single line separated by spaces, and then returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.
