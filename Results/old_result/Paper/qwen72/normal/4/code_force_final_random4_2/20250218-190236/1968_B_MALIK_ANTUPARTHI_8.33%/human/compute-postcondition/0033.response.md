Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is `b` or the index where the loop was broken, `k` is the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range defined by `b`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all.
- The variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, stopping at `b - 1`.
- The variable `k` is updated based on the presence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the loop breaks.
- If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.
- After the loop completes all iterations or is broken, `j` will either be `b` (if the loop completed all iterations) or the index where the loop was broken.
- Similarly, `k` will either be the index of the last occurrence of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1, or the index where the loop was broken.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
