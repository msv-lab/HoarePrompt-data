The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `water`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `water` was the second element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `water` will be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is `2 * (water - target)`, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `water` is the third element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` is greater than or equal to 0.**
