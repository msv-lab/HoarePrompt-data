The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers representing the scores of three players, and they are sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30).

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players, sorted in non-decreasing order, and returns a value based on these scores.**
