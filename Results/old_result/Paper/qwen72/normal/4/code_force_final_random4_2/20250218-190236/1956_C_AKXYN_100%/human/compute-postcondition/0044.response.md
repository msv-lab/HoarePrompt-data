The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as an implicit variable, let's call it `iterations`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the value of `iterations`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. However, since `i` is not used in the loop head and the loop variable `_` is not tracked, we only need to consider the state of `iterations`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `iterations` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is incremented implicitly by the `range` function, we don't need to adjust `_` explicitly. The state of `n` and `i` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `iterations` must be greater than 0**
