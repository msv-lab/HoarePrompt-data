The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`.**
