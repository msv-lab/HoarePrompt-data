The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2, and `temp` remains 0.**
