Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant integer value. It will be printed as `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `i`**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is 3. It will be printed as `3`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(n, 0, -1)`**
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the sequence will be `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n = 3`, the sequence generated by `range(3, 0, -1)` is `[3, 2, 1]`.
- If `n = 4`, the sequence generated by `range(4, 0, -1)` is `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- If `n = 5`, the sequence generated by `range(5, 0, -1)` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the constant integer `2`, followed by the value of `i` which is `3`, and then the unpacked sequence of integers from `n` down to 1.

Output: **2 3 n (n-1) (n-2) ... 1 (where n is the value of n and is greater than or equal to 3)**
