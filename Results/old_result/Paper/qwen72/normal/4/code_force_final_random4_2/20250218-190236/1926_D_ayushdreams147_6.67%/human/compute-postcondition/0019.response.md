Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is the transformed value of an element in `a` and the value is the count of how many times the original element appeared in `a` minus the number of times the transformed value appeared in `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the initial number of elements in the list `a`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `res` is the count of unique elements in the list `a` after each element has been transformed using the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`.
- The dictionary `count` contains keys that are the transformed values of the elements in `a`, and the value associated with each key is the difference between the count of the original element and the count of the transformed value in the list `a`.
