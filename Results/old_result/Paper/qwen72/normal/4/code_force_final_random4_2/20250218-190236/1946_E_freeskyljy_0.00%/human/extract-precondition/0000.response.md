Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, and m1 and m2 are the number of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, p and s, where p contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and s contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The values of n, m1, and m2 must satisfy 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5. The lists p and s must contain distinct integers within the range [1, n] and must be sorted in increasing order.**

Note: The function definition provided in the example is incorrect as it does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
```
def func_1(n, m1, m2, p, s):
```
