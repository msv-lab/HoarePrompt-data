The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is within the range of the length of `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is 1, and `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `nums` must still have at least 2 integers (since the loop condition is `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is 2, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`**
