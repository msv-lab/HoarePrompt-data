Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after accounting for the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the calculation of `extra_screen` is incorrect. The program should calculate the total number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons together, rather than separately and then adding them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns)
        cells_per_screen = 15
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y * 4 + cells_per_screen - 1) // cells_per_screen
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * cells_per_screen - y * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons
        if x <= remaining_cells:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_cells + cells_per_screen - 1) // cells_per_screen
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        result.append(total_screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons**: 
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons is `(y * 4 + cells_per_screen - 1) // cells_per_screen`. This ensures that any remaining cells after a full screen is used are accounted for by adding an extra screen if necessary.

2. **Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons**:
   - The remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons are `screens_for_2x2 * cells_per_screen - y * 4`.

3. **Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons**:
   - If the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) can fit into the remaining cells, no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons are `(x - remaining_cells + cells_per_screen - 1) // cells_per_screen`.

4. **Output the total number of screens**:
   - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and any additional screens required for 1x1 icons.

This corrected version should handle all test cases correctly.
