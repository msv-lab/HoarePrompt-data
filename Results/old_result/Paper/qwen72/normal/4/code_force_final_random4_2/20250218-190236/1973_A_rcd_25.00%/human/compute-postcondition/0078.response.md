To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `high` and `cur` since they are the only variables in the loop head condition `while high >= cur`.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 2
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`
- If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 2`

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

### Current State:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `cur` is set to `low + 2` (if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not met)

### Adjustments:
- The only variables that can be adjusted are `high` and `cur`.
- Since `high` is already the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it cannot be adjusted further.
- `cur` is set to `low + 2` in the loop body, so we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `low + 2` for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute one more time if `high` is greater than or equal to `low + 2`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`**
