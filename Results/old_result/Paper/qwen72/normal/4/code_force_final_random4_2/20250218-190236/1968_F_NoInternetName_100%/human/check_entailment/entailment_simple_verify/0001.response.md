### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be split into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - This can be simplified by checking if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

2. **Prefix XOR Array**:
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the indices where the prefix XOR values match.
   - `func_4` and `func_3` are helper functions that perform binary search to find the largest index less than `l` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` where the prefix XOR values match.
   - However, the binary search logic in `func_2` is designed to find the largest index where the predicate is true, and the smallest index where the predicate is false. This is used to find the indices in `inds` where the prefix XOR values match within the range.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes".
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there are indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
   - Specifically, it checks if there exists an index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and an index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` such that `upper > lower`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is zero by directly printing "Yes".
   - It also handles the case where the XOR is not zero by using binary search to check for matching indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient because it precomputes the prefix XOR array and uses binary search to handle queries, which is \( O(\log n) \) per query.
   - The overall complexity is \( O(n + q \log n) \), which is suitable given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function reads input and splits it into a list of integers. It is correctly used to read the number of test cases, the number of elements and queries, and the elements of the array and the queries.
  - The state before the function call is correctly described.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function performs a binary search to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
  - The state before and after the function call is correctly described.
  - The function correctly returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is true, or `None` if no such index exists.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
  - This function is a simple wrapper around `func_2` and is correctly used to find the largest index where the predicate is true.
  - The state before and after the function call is correctly described.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
  - This function is a wrapper around `func_2` that returns the largest index where the predicate is true, plus one.
  - The state before and after the function call is correctly described.
  - The function correctly returns the largest index `l` where `predicate(arr[l])` is true, plus one, or `None` if no such index exists.

- **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
  - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
  - It reads the number of elements `n` and queries `q`, and the array `a`.
  - It constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
  - For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero.
  - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes".
  - If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR values match within the range.
  - The state before and after each key point in the function is correctly described.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases. The binary search logic is correctly applied to find the necessary indices, and the program handles the XOR checks and queries as expected.

Final: **True**
