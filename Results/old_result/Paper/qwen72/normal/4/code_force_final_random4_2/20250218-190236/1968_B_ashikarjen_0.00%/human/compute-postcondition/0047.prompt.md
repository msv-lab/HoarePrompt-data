Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: a list of test cases and the test cases themselves. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The integers `n` and `m` satisfy 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the total sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The binary strings `a` and `b` consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. `n` and `m` are now specific integers provided by the input. `a` is now a binary string input by the user. `b` is now a binary string input by the user. `k` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
        j += 1
    if j < m:
        k += 1
        j += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, `j` remains `m` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[2]`, and `j` is either `m` or the index where `b[j]` equals `a[2]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
