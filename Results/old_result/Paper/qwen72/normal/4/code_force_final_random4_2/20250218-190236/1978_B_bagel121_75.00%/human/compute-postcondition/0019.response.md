The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly stated in the state.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no changes are made to `k`, `ans`, or `p2`. Otherwise, `k` is set to the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is set to the integer result of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, and `p2` is set to `(n - k) * a`.**
