To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 2
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`

The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` was updated to `low + 1`, and the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)` was true. This implies that `cur` is now `low + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` after this update. Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of these two values, `high` should be greater than or equal to `low + 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur` (which is now `low + 1`).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is `low + 1`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`**
