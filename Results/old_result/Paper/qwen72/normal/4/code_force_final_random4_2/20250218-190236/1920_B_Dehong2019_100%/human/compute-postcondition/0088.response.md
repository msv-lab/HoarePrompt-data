Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 2, `ans1` is now `a[1] + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains `a[1] + a[2]`. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.***
