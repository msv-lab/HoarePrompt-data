Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
1
10
```

For the third test case, the input is:
```
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is `3` because you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1 and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1, until there are 3 cards left. However, the program outputs `10`, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the main loop. The program incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and does not correctly handle the reduction of cards based on the frequency of each number. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
