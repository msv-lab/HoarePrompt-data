Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2. If `p1 - 1` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - 1)`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is set to `p3 - 2`, and `x` is set to 2.***
