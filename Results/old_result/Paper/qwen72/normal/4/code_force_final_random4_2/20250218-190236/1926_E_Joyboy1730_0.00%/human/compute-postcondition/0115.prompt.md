Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - sum(L)`, `L` has all its elements, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - sum(L)`, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` for any element `a` in `L`, the loop prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations without printing or breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `a` is the last element in the list `L`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, `m` is 1, `_` is 1, and `k` is `k - tot` if the loop did not break early. If the loop breaks early, `k` is updated to `2 * k - 1` and the value `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
