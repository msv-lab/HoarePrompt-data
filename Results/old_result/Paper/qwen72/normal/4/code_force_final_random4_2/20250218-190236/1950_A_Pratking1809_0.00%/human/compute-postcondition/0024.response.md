Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\) and are assigned values from the input.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `mn` is 100.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true.
- Otherwise, if `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` is true.
- If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, then both conditions are false.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'NONE'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement does not use any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` or any other conditions in the initial state.

Output: **NONE**
