Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` is the final value of `n`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. `prev` is 0.**

The code snippet `prev = 0` explicitly sets the variable `prev` to 0, which is already the case according to the initial state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
