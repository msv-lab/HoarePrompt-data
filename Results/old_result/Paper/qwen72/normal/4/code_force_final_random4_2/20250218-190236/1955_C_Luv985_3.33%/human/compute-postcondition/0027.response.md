Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The value of `t` is now `k % 2`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
