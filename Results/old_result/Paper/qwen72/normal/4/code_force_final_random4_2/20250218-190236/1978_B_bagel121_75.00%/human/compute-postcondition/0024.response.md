Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`, `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are still input integers.
- `k` is still `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
- `ans` is still `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is now assigned the value `(n - k) * a`.
