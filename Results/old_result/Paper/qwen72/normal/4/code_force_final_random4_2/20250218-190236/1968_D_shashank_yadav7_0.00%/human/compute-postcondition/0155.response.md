The function `func` accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the permutation.
  - `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the duration of the game.
  - `P_B` and `P_S` are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the elements of the permutation `p`.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array `a`.

The function returns the results for each test case, which are not explicitly defined in the provided output. However, based on the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function returns some form of result or outcome for each test case, likely related to the positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a permutation `p` of length `n`, an array `a` of length `n`, a game duration `k`, and starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` for Bodya and Sasha. The function returns the results for each test case, which are likely related to the positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.**
