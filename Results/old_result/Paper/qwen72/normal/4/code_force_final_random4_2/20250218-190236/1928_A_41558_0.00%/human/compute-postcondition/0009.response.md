The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several conditions and constraints on the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
- Either `a` is even, or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are even.
- `a / 2` is not equal to `b` and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`.

The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **YES**
