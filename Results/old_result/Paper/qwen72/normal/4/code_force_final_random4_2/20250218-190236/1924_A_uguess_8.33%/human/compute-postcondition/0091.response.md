Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo `(1 << k)`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', `tmp` is the character 'b'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the value of `tmp` to be the character obtained by adding the value of `i` to the ASCII value of 'a'.
- Given that `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes the character 'b' (since `ord('a')` is 97 and `97 + 1` is 98, which corresponds to 'b').
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
