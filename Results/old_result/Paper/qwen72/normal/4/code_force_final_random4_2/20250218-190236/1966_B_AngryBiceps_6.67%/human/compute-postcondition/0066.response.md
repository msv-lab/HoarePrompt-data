Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second input value in `a`, `i` is 1, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second input value in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the second input value in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- Initially, `last_row` was the last character of the first input value in `a`.
- After execution, `last_row` now contains the last character of the first input value in `a` followed by the last character of the second input value in `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
