Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is `k - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `k-1`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The initial state of `a` being a sorted list of integers in descending order remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `t` being an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k` remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `_` being a placeholder variable remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is still `k - 1`.
- The expression for `ans1` and `ans2` remains the same, but `n`, `k`, and `x` are now specific values provided by the input.
