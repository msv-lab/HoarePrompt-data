Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ans` is 1.
- `n` is currently equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
