Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is `k + x - 1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])`, and `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans2 = ans1` assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `_`, `i`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans2` is now the same as the value of `ans1`, which is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k+x-2])`.
- The initial conditions and the values of the other variables are still valid and unchanged.
