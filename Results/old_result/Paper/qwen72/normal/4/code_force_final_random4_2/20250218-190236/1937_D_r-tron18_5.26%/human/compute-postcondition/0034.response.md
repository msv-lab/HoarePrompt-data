Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, 1) + n + 1`. If `zr` > `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
