Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has reset `cur` to 0 because `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
- `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', modulo \((1 << k)\).
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is a straightforward command that outputs the string `'NO'` to the console.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
