To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `a`:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed in their positions.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Construction**:
   - The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]`.

2. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices**:
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed in their positions.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The elements at even indices are 1, 3, and 5. Reversing these elements gives the list `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

3. **General Pattern**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will have the first half of the even-indexed elements reversed and placed at the even indices, while the odd-indexed elements remain in their original positions.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - The elements at even indices are 1, 3, and 5. Reversing these elements gives the list `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The list `a` will have the elements at even indices reversed and placed back at those indices, while the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions. The output will be the elements of the list `a` printed in this modified order.

Output: **[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6] (for n = 6, the elements at even indices are reversed, resulting in the list [5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6])**.

For a general `n`, the output will be a list where the elements at even indices are reversed and placed back at those indices, while the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions. The exact values will depend on the value of `n`.

Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1, n (if n is odd)] or [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., n-1 (if n is even)]**.
