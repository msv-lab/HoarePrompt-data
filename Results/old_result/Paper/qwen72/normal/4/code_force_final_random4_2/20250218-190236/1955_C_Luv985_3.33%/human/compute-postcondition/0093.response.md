Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `a[r]` is not 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 2`. `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 2. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. The first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, the second-to-last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is also 0.***
