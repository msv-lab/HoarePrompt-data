You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array for each test case. The length of each inner list n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        le = len(a)
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 1, 1
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` have been updated according to the logic of the loop. Specifically, for each test case, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is the list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the result of the computation `le - max(st, end)` unless the first and last elements of `a` are equal, in which case `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. The final output for each test case is the value of `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `arrays`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is determined based on the elements of the array for that test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
