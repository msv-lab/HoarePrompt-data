### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k > n`, it prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations if `k` is greater than the number of cards.
   - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange all `n` cards for `k - 1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` and updates the frequency of each number.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it caps it at `k`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After calculating the frequency table, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If any frequency is `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one operation to exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards.
   - If no frequency is `k`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the frequency of any number is greater than `k`. It caps the frequency at `k`, but this does not reflect the actual number of cards that can be exchanged.
- The program does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further. It only checks if there is a single frequency that is exactly `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each card number, calculate how many full operations can be performed (i.e., how many times `k` cards of the same number can be exchanged).
- The number of cards left for each number after performing the operations should be the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k`.
- The total number of cards left is the sum of these remainders.

### Correctness:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the frequency capping correctly and does not consider multiple operations.

### Correctness: **False**
