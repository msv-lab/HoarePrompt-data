Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the first element of `a` is 1. If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. If no exception occurs, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least 2, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1. If `a[d]` is 0, `d` is updated to `d - 1`, and the last integer in the list `a` is 0. If `a[0]` is 0, `g` is 1. Otherwise, `g` remains 0. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `a`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least 2, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or minus 2 (depending on whether `a[d]` was 0), `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` must be at least `2 * (i + 1)`. The value at index `d` in the list `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `a`, `g`, and `d` may remain unchanged or partially updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus 1, `k` is the second integer in the list `a` and must be at least `2 * (i + 2)`, `i` is `i + 2`. If no exception occurs, the value at index `d` in the list `a` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, and if `a[d]` was 0, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 2 or minus 3 (depending on whether `a[d]` was 0). If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
