Let's break down the print statement step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the integer `1`.
   - The second argument is the variable `i`, which is explicitly given as 1.
   - The third argument is the result of the `range(n, 0, -1)` function, which generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

4. **Range Function:**
   - `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, the sequence will be `[3, 2, 1]`.

5. **Unpacking the Range:**
   - The `*` operator before `range(n, 0, -1)` unpacks the sequence generated by `range` into individual arguments for the `print` function.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` function will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `i` (which is 1), and then the sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **1 1 [n] [n-1] ... 2 1 (where [n] is the value of n and the sequence is from n down to 1)**
