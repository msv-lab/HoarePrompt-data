Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]` and then increased by `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, a[b] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is 0, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- Since `bm` is initially 0, and `k` is -1, the expression `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to `a[b] * -1 + bp`.
- Therefore, `bm` becomes `max(0, a[b] * -1 + bp)`.
- The value of `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, so `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
