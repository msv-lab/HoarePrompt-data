### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line of input.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` from the second line of input.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The function ensures that `m` is the minimum of the maximum tickets purchasable each day and the number of tickets to be bought (`k`), which is a valid constraint based on the problem description.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices `a` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows the function to buy the cheapest tickets first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days**:
   - The function calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, given the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The function selects the first `q` elements from the sorted list `a` and stores them in `N`. These are the days with the lowest ticket prices.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the exact number of tickets can be bought by purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n` days. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the increasing prices due to the tickets bought on previous days.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the last day might require buying fewer than `m` tickets. The function calculates the cost for the last day separately and then adds the cost for the remaining days.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cost Calculation for the Last Day**:
  - The formula for the cost when `n * m != k` seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the term `n * m * mu` is added, which is not necessary. The correct formula should be:
    - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w`
  - The term `n * m * mu` incorrectly adds an extra cost that is not justified by the problem constraints.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
- If `n * m != k`:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w`

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct but has a small mistake in the cost calculation for the last day when `n * m != k`.

### Correctness:
**False**
