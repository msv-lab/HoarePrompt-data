Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `prev` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`.
- Since `i` is 3, `prev` is now 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
