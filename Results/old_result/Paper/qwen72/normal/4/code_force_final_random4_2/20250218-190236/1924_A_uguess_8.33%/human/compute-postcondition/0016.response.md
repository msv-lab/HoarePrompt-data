Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the ASCII value of the second character of the string `s` and subtracts the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This result is stored in `cur_ss`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- `ss` is still the second character of `s`.
- `cur_ss` is now the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
