The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the for loop. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
