Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is updated based on the condition: if `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the larger of `diff1` and `diff2` (where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b`); if `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of the first element of `item`. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated as follows: if `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is set to 1 if `diff1` > `diff2` and `tp2` remains `m - 1`, or `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2` if `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`; if `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is set to 1 if `item[2]` is 0, otherwise `tp1` remains 0, and `tp2` is set to `m - 2` if `item[2]` is `m - 1`, otherwise `tp2` remains `m - 1`. `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and its index in `b` (i.e., `item[2]`) is either outside the range `[tp1, tp2]` or within the updated range `[tp1, tp2]` but not equal to the original `tp1` if the else part executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`max_heap` now contains `n - 2` tuples, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
