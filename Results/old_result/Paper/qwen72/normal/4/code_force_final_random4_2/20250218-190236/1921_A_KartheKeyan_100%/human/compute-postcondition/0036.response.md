Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the value of `p2` based on the elements of the `coord` list. `p2` is assigned the value of the squared difference of the x-coordinates of the third and fourth tuples plus the squared difference of the y-coordinates of the third and fourth tuples. The values of `total`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `p1` retains its previous value, which is the difference between the x-coordinates of the first and second tuples.
