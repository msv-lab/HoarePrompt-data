Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be defined with parameters to accept the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, the number of cards to exchange `k`, and a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards. However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not include these parameters. A correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, k, c):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `p` is a list containing the counts of each unique integer in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
