Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 1, `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - a`, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is 1, `_` is 1, and if `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 1, `_` is 1, `k` is `k - tot`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a + a`, `pow` is 8, `m` is 1, `_` is 1. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` is updated to `k - tot` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables and list remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
