The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, so it needs to be set to 0 for the loop to begin. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) are not in the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
