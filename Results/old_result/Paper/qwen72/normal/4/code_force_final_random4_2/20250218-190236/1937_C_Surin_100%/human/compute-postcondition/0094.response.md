Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - `r` is the new input string.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively.
   - If `r` is '<', `v1` is updated to 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is initially 1.
   - `v2` is 3.
   - If `r` is '<', `v1` is updated to 2. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, so we need to consider both cases:
     - If `r` is not '<', `v1` remains 1.
     - If `r` is '<', `v1` is updated to 2.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `r` is not '<':
     - The print statement will use `v1 = 1` and `v2 = 3`.
     - The output will be: `? 1 1 3 3`.
   - If `r` is '<':
     - The print statement will use `v1 = 2` and `v2 = 3`.
     - The output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both possible outputs. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 3 3 (where [v1] is 1 if `r` is not '<', and 2 if `r` is '<')**
