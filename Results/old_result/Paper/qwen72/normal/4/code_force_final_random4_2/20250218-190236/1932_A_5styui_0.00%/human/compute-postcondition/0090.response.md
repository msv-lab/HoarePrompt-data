Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character. If the character at index `j` in `b` is `@`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0, and the character at index `j` in `b` is not `@`. If the character at index `j` in `b` is `*`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is also `*`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
