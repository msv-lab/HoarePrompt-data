You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters (either '0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` is 0, `i` is `a` (which is 0), `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1' from all iterations, and the length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1' across all iterations. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this relationship holds true.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It returns "triangle" if the shape in the grid is a triangle, and "square" if the shape in the grid is a square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
