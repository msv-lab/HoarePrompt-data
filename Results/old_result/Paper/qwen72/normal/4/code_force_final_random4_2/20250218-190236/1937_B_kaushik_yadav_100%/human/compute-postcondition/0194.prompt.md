Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is either the first character of `a` or `a[0] + b[0]` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False. `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met. If `work` is True and `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])` is true, `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` remains True, and if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is `a[0] + b[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 1. If `work` is False, `i` is 1 and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have a length greater than 1, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty. If `work` is True, `ans` is either the first character of `b` if `work` was False, or `a[0] + b[0] + a[1]` if `work` was True and `i + 1 < len(a)`, or `a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1]` if `work` was True and `i + 1 == len(a)`. `i` is 1 if `i + 1 == len(a)`, or 2 if `i + 1 != len(a)`. `j` is `len(a) - 2`. `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met. `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True. If `work` is False, `ans` is now `ans + b[1]` if `work` was True, or `b[0] + b[1]` if `work` was False, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met, `work` is False if `work` was True and `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])` is true, otherwise `work` remains True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty and have a length greater than 2, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met. If `work` is True, `ans` is `a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1] + a[2]`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1] + a[2] + b[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is 3 and `j` is `len(a) - 2`. If `work` is False, `ans` is `a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1] + b[2]`, `i` is 3, and `j` is `len(a) - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
