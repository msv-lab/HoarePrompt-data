Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, and the list at index `u` now contains the integer `v` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 2`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the integer `v` to the list at index `u` in the `u2vs` list.
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, and the list at index `v` already contains the integer `u`.
- After executing the code, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will now contain the integer `v` in addition to its previous contents.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from the initial state.
