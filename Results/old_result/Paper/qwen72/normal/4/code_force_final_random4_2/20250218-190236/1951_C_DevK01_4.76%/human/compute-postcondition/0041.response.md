Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. In both cases, `n` is the number of elements in the updated `N`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `M` to a new list of integers provided by the user input.
- The initial state specifies that `M` was already a sorted list of integers provided by user input, but this initial value is now overwritten by the new user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, `mu`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged or are dependent on the new value of `M` and the existing values of other variables.
- The specific values and conditions for `k`, `q`, `N`, `cost`, `w`, `mu`, and `n` are still based on the initial state and the new value of `M`.
