Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `n` is 1 and `k` is 10000000000000, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied, and the first element of `a` is 1. If `n` is not 1 or `k` is not 10000000000000, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. Additionally, if `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs at any point, the state of all variables remains unchanged.***
