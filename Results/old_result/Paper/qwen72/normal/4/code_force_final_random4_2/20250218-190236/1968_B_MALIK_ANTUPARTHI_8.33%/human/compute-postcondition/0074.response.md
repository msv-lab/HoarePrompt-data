To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `b` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, and it will iterate from 0 to `b-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `b` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State of `j`**: `j` will be 0 at the start of the loop.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `k`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `b` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `j` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is 0, `k` is 0, `b` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input.**
