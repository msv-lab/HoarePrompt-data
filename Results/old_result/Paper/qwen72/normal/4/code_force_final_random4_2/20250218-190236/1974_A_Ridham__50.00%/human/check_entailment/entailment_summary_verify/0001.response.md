### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`, which is correct.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`, which is also correct.
   - The combined total space required is `total_space = space_y + space_x`, but this variable is not used in the further calculations, so it is not necessary.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The function correctly calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
   - This is accurate because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and the remaining cells on the last screen (if `y` is odd) are 7 cells, which is sufficient to hold additional 1x1 icons.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This formula ensures that the total number of cells used for 2x2 icons is subtracted from the total number of cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

5. **Check if 1x1 Icons Fit in Remaining Cells:**
   - The function correctly checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells:
     - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
     - If `space_x > remaining_cells`, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
       - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
       - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

6. **Output:**
   - The function correctly appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
  - The calculation for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, so the formula `y // 2` for even `y` and `y // 2 + 1` for odd `y` is accurate.

- **Correctness of Remaining Cells Calculation:**
  - The calculation for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. The formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` correctly determines the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icons Placement:**
  - The function correctly checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells. If they can, it uses the same number of screens. If they cannot, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - The logic for calculating the additional screens is correct, ensuring that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

- **Output:**
  - The function correctly appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results for all test cases.
