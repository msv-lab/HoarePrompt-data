Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was removed from `max_heap`. The third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in `b`. `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. Additionally, `diff1` is greater than `diff2`. `tp1` is increased by 1.**
