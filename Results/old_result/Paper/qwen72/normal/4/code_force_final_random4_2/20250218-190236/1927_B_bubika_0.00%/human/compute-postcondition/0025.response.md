Output State: **`s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is assigned the value of the index of `i` in the list `b`.
- The list `s` and the variable `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is the position (index) of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`, assuming `b` is a list that contains `i`. If `b` does not contain `i`, a `ValueError` will be raised, but this is not part of the output state.
