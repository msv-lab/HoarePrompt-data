You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 means the cell is free and 1 means the cell contains a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases, each consisting of two lines as described. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1` (which is the last iteration index), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the last input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the length of the last `a` minus 1, and `res` is the number of zeros in the last `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the state of the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Trimming the List**:
   - The program trims the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done using two `while` loops:
     - The first loop removes leading zeros.
     - The second loop removes trailing zeros.
   - This step is crucial because it focuses the problem on the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and the free cells between them.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) using a simple loop.
   - The count of zeros represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step:

- **Trimming the List**:
  - Removing leading and trailing zeros is correct because it isolates the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and the free cells between them. This ensures that the problem is reduced to the relevant part of the ribbon.
  - However, the program prints the trimmed list `a` using `print(a)`, which is not necessary for the problem and should be removed for a cleaner solution.

- **Counting Free Cells**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of free cells (zeros) in the trimmed list. This count is indeed the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.
  - The logic of moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left is implicitly handled by this count, as each zero represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which is the correct output.

However, there is a minor issue with the program:

- **Unnecessary Print Statement**:
  - The line `print(a)` after trimming the list is unnecessary and should be removed. It does not affect the correctness of the solution but is not part of the required output.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of solving the problem, but it includes an unnecessary print statement.

Correctness: **True** (but with a minor improvement suggestion to remove the unnecessary print statement).
