### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `t` to the number of test cases, which is correctly read from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of constraints) and initializes `cx` (a set to store values that `k` must not be equal to), `ax` (the minimum upper bound), and `bx` (the maximum lower bound).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program correctly updates `bx` for constraints of type 1 (`k >= x`), `ax` for constraints of type 2 (`k <= x`), and adds `x` to `cx` for constraints of type 3 (`k != x`).
   - The initial values of `ax` and `bx` are set to `1000000007` and `-1`, respectively, which are appropriate because they ensure that `ax` and `bx` are updated to valid bounds if any constraints of type 1 or 2 are encountered.

3. **Bounds Validation:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, indicating that no integer `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - This check is necessary because if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, there are no valid integers `k`.

4. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - If the bounds are valid (`bx <= ax`), the program initializes `tmp` to `0` and iterates over the set `cx` to count the number of values that fall within the bounds `[bx, ax]`.
   - This ensures that the program correctly accounts for the values that `k` must not be equal to.

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program calculates the number of valid integers `k` as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - This formula is correct because `ax - bx + 1` gives the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `tmp` is the count of invalid values within this range.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line, which matches the required output format.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case. The logic is sound, and the annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior align with the problem description and the original assessment.

Final: **True**
