The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2**
