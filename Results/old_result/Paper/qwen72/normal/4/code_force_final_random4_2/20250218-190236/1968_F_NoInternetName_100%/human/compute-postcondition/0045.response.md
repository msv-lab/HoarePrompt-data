To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the precondition and understand the context:

1. **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`**:
   - This means `n` is at least as large as the length of the list `a`.

2. **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30**:
   - `a` is a list of integers, each of which is between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\).

3. **`x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point**:
   - `x[0]` is 0 (since there are no elements before the first element of `a`).
   - `x[1]` is `a[0]`.
   - `x[2]` is `a[0] ^ a[1]`.
   - `x[3]` is `a[0] ^ a[1] ^ a[2]`.
   - And so on, up to `x[n]` which is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`.

4. **`inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory**:
   - `inds` maps each element in `x` to a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.

5. **`q` is greater than 1**:
   - This is a condition that `q` is greater than 1, but it doesn't directly affect the `print` statement.

6. **`i` is 2**:
   - This is a specific value for the variable `i`.

7. **`l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`**:
   - The function `func_1(int)` returns two values, `l` and `r`. The exact values of `l` and `r` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are not provided in the precondition.

8. **`lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0**:
   - `lower` is determined by checking the list of indices in `inds` for the value `x[r]` and finding the first index that is less than `l`. If no such index exists, `lower` is 0.

9. **`upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0**:
   - `upper` is determined by checking the list of indices in `inds` for the value `x[l - 1]` and finding the last index that is less than or equal to `r`. If no such index exists, `upper` is 0.

Given the `print('Yes')` statement, the output is simply the string 'Yes'. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` do not affect the `print` statement directly because it only prints a fixed string.

Output: **Yes**
