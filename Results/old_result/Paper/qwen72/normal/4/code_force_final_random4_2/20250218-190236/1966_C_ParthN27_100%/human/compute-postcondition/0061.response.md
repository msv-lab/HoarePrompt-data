Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, and the difference between the current element `s[i]` and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The condition that the difference between the current element `s[i]` and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 is still valid. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
