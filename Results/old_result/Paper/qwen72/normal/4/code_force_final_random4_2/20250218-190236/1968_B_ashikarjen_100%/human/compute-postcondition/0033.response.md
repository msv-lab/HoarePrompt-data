The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, then `j` remains `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
