The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the integer at index `p[s] - 2` in the list `a` plus `a[s]` and then increased by `a[s]`, `bm` is 0, `sm` is 0, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**
