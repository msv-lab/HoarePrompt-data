### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then prints the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.

3. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares, which is correct for the given problem.

4. **Operations:**
   - The function performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation using the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

5. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, with the first line containing the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - Each subsequent line correctly describes the type of operation, the row or column index, and the permutation used.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, performs the operations within the allowed limit, and outputs the correct maximum sum and operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
