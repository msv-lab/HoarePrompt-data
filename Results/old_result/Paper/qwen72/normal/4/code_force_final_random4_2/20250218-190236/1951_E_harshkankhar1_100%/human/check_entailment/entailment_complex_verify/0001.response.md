### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - The function returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single part which is not a palindrome.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
     - It iterates through the string and sets `x` to the index of the first different character.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO".
     - This is correct because if all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
   - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because if `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the partition is valid.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
     - This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible partitions. For example, if `s` is "abba" and `x` is 1, the function will print "NO" even though "ab" and "ba" are valid non-palindromic partitions.
   - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
     - This is correct because if `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, the partition `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` will ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Case 1: `s` is not a palindrome**
  - The program correctly prints "YES" and the entire string `s` as a single part.
  - This is accurate and meets the problem requirements.

- **Case 2: `s` is a palindrome and all characters are the same**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" because a string with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
  - This is accurate and meets the problem requirements.

- **Case 3: `s` is a palindrome and there is at least one different character**
  - The program finds the first different character at index `x`.
  - It then checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
  - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
  - This is accurate and meets the problem requirements.
  - However, if `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
    - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
    - This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible partitions. For example, "abba" should be partitioned into "ab" and "ba", but the program will print "NO" if `x` is 1.
  - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES" and partitions the string into `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
  - This is accurate and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the condition where it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is indeed too restrictive and can lead to incorrect "NO" outputs for some valid cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we should remove the condition that checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` and instead always try to partition the string into two parts when a different character is found. Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    else:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(2)
    print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
```

This version will correctly handle all cases by ensuring that the string is partitioned into two non-palindromic parts whenever possible.
