Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` can result in a tower of `c` cubes. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, and it should not be used in the logic to determine the outcome of each test case. Instead, the correct condition should be based on the parity of `b` and `c`.

The correct condition should be:
- If `b` is even, then `c` must also be even.
- If `b` is odd, then `c` must also be odd.

This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will match the parity of the number of moves if the tower starts with zero cubes.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This version correctly checks if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the target number of cubes `m` and if the parities of `n` and `m` are the same. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
