To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `q` and the set `ans`.

1. **Variable `q`**: This variable will take on the values of the elements in the set `ans` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values from `ans` automatically.

2. **Set `ans`**: The loop will only execute if `ans` is not empty. Given the initial state, `ans` contains the integer `x`. Therefore, `ans` is not empty, and the loop will execute at least once.

Since `ans` already contains the integer `x`, the loop will execute at least once. No adjustments are needed to the state of `ans` or `q` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`; `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set.**
