The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` assigns the value of `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element in the list `preOne`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific values or the contents of `preOne`, we can only describe the change in terms of the last element of `preOne`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `suffZero` has a new element appended which is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), `oneInd` is 2 * the last element in `preOne`.**
