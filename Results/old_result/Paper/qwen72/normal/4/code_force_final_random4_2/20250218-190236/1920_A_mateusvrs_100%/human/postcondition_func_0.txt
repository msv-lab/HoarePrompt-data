The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads `n` pairs of integers (a, x) where `a` indicates the type of constraint and `x` is an integer value. The function calculates and returns a list of integers, one for each test case. Each integer in the list represents the number of integers within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive) that are not in the set of constraints of type 3, where `bx` is the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1, and `ax` is the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result for that test case is 0. The function then prints each result on a new line.
