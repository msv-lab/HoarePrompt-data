The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of edges to be marked in the adjacency matrix. The function returns an adjacency matrix `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1). In this matrix, `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1 for each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()` over the `m` iterations. All other elements in the matrix are 0.
