Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are now the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` from the start node to the current node. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated `queue` and `visited` set.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` is a non-empty list, `current` and `dist` are the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`, `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` also includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited, plus the `neighbor` node. `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, and `neighbor` is the first element in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` is a non-empty list, `current` and `dist` are the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` also includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, and `neighbor` is the second element in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, and `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` also includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, and `neighbor` is the third element in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
