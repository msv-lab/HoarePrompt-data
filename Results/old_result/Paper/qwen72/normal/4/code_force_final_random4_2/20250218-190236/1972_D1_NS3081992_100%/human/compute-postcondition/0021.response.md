Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `processing` will have its elements at positions `di - 1` (for each `di` in `d[da]`) temporarily set to 1 and then reset to 0. The value of `tmp` will be the minimum value between the initial `tmp` and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The values of `d`, `rank`, and `da` remain unchanged, except `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.**
