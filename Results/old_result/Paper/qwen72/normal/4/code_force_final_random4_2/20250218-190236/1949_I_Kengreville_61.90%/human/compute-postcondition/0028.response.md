Functionality: ** The function `dfs(i)` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark nodes as visited and appends the indices of visited nodes to the `nodes` list. Additionally, for each unvisited node `j` that satisfies the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists. After the function concludes, `visited[i]` is `True`, and the `nodes` list contains the indices of all nodes visited during the DFS traversal. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are updated for nodes that satisfy the specified condition. **
