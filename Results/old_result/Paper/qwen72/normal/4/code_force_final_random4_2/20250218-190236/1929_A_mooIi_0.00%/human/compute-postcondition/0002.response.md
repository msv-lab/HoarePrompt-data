Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to n, `_` is 0, `ar` is a map object containing the string representations of the sorted integers from the input.**

The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the list of integers, and then maps each integer to its string representation. The result is stored in the variable `ar` as a map object. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`) remain unchanged.
