The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 0, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Therefore, `res` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is incremented by 1**
