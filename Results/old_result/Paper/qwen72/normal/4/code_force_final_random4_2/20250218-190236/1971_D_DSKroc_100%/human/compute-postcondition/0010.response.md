Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `count` is 1 if the integer value of the first character of `s` is not equal to the integer value of the second character of `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. `flag` is 1, and `i` is 0. The integer value of the first character of `s` is less than the integer value of the second character of `s`.**
