Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `temp` is the index at which the loop breaks or -1 if the loop completes all iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder variable and is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `m` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b` for each index from 0 up to the point where the loop either breaks or completes all iterations.
- The list `a` remains a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` remains a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input, but in descending order.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or it will be the index at which the loop breaks.
- The variable `temp` will be the index at which the loop breaks, or it will remain -1 if the loop completes all iterations.
