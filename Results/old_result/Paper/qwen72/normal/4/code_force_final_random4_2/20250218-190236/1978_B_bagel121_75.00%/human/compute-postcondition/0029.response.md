Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. If `a` is less than `b`, it calculates and prints a value that is the sum of `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus `(n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the input variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer relevant. **
