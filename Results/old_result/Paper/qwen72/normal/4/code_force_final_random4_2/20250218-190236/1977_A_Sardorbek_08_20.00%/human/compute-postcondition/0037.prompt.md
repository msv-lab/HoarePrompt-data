Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif a % 2 == b % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`. If `b` == `c`, the values of `b` and `c` remain equal. If `b` < `c`, the current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`. If `b` >= `c`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are either even or both are odd), the program maintains this condition. Otherwise, `a` and `b` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is a tuple containing the current values of `b` and `c`. If `b` == `c`, the values of `b` and `c` remain equal. If `b` < `c`, the current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`. If `b` >= `c`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and if `a` and `b` have the same parity (both are either even or both are odd), the program maintains this condition. Otherwise, `a` and `b` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `q` is a tuple containing the new values of `b` and `c`. `b` and `c` are now the values provided by the user input, and their relationship (whether `b` == `c`, `b` < `c`, or `b` >= `c`) is updated based on the new values. If `b` == `c`, the program maintains the same parity condition for `a` and `b` (both are either even or both are odd, or one is even and the other is odd). If `b` != `c`, the program also maintains the same parity condition for `a` and `b` (both are either even or both are odd, or one is even and the other is odd).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
