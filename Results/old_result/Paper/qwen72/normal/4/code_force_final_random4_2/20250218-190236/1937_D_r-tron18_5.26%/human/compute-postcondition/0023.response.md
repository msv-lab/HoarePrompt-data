Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the last character of `s1` is '<'***
