Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for the given problem description:

1. **Global Variable Usage:** The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without initializing them within the scope of `func_1`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the program is run multiple times or in different contexts.

2. **Function Call in `func_1`:** The function `make_array` is called with the wrong arguments. The `right` argument should be `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, but it is currently being passed as `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1) + 1`. This can cause out-of-bounds errors when accessing the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Clique Assignment Logic:** The logic for assigning vertices to cliques in `make_array` is incorrect. The way the elements are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. Specifically, the way the elements are distributed between `small_element` and `big_element` does not guarantee that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.

4. **Output Format:** The program does not handle the input and output format correctly. It does not read the number of test cases `t` and does not process each test case individually. It also does not print the results in the correct format for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k, n), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
    
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    for i in range(left, right):
        arr[i] = i + 1
        cliquess[i] = clique

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program:**

1. **Initialization:** The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are initialized within the `solve` function to ensure they are reset for each test case.
2. **Function Call:** The `make_array` function is called with the correct arguments to ensure the vertices are assigned to the correct cliques.
3. **Clique Assignment Logic:** The `make_array` function assigns consecutive integers to the vertices in each clique, ensuring that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
4. **Input and Output:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually, printing the results in the correct format.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
