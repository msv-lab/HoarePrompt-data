Output State: **After the loop executes all `m` iterations, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`. `r` and `c` remain unchanged as they are determined by the string returned by `func_1()`. The loop counter `_` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the loop counter `_` is still equal to `m`.
