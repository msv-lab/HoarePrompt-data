Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `i` is 'C', `ans` is `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `m` added to its previous value (which was 0 if `i` was in `hmp`).**
