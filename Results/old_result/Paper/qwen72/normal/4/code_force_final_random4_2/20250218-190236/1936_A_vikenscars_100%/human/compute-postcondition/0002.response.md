Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**.

The value of `ans` is now the result of the function `func_1` called with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`, all of which are 0 and 1 respectively. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `max_item_idx`) remain unchanged.
