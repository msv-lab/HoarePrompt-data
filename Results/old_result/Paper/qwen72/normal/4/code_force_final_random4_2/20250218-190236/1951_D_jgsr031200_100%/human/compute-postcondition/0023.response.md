Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n % (n - k + 1) + n`. `i` is 1. `curr` is `n`. `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - n - curr`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `n` is updated by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it.
- Since `i` is 1 and `curr` is `n`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - 1 * n`, which simplifies to `n - n`.
- However, `n` was already modified to `n % (n - k + 1) - n` before this operation, so the final value of `n` is `n % (n - k + 1) - n - curr`.
- The values of `n` and `k` being positive integers and `n` not equal to `k` remain unchanged.
- The list `costs` and the variable `h` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `curr` remains `n`.
