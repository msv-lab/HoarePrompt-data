To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

1. **`j < m`**: 
   - Given that `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to start.
   - The current state is `j` is less than `m` (since `j` is updated to `m + 1` only if `j` is less than `m`).

2. **`b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - Given that `i` is 1, and `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, we need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]` for the loop to start.
   - Since `j` is less than `m` and `m` is at least 3, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2. We need to ensure that `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]` for the loop to execute.

Given the current state, `j` is less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]` for the loop to execute. Since `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, we need to ensure that `b[j]` is also not equal to `a[1]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`**
