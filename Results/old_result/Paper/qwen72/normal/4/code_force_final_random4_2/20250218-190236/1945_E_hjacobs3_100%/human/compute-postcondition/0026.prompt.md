You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is at most 1, and `array[l]` is the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` is 0 and `r` is 1 if `find` is less than `array[0]`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or 0 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. The second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is at most 1, and `array[l]` is the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` is 0 and `r` is 1 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two string values: the first value is the string representation of the index (plus 1) of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or "0" if `find` is less than the first element of the array. The second value is the string representation of the index (plus 1) of `find` in the array.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two string values: the first value is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, or 0 if `find` is less than `array[0]`. The second value is the string representation of the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
