The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` in steps of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `n - 3`. The loop condition `i >= 0` must still be true, so `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5**
