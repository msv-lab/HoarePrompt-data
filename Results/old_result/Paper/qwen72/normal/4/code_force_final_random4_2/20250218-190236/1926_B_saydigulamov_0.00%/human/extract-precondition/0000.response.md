Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters (either '0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.**
