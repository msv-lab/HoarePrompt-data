Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` - 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` (2 <= n <= 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]` converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `4 + 3 * n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(a)` appended to it twice, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.**
