Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to new input integers.
- If the new `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds.
- If the new `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds.
- If the new `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the condition `b - a < n` holds.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - The expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` needs to be evaluated.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(b - a)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`.
   - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This is a formula that calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers. The formula for the sum of the first `k` integers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - `a * n`: This is the product of `a` and `n`.
   - The entire expression is then converted to an integer using `int()`.

3. **Conditions and Their Impact:**
   - If `b <= a`, then `(b - a)` is non-positive, and the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers will be 0.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, then `(b - a)` is positive and the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers will be a positive integer.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, then `(b - a)` is positive but less than `n`, and the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers will be a positive integer.

### Final Output:
- The expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` will be evaluated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where `a`, `b`, and `n` are the updated input integers, and `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`)**
