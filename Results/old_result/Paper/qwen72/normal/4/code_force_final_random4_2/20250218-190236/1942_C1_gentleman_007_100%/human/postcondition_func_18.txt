The function `func_19` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of the smallest and largest elements in `p`. It returns the length of `p` if `x` is greater than the maximum value in `p`. Otherwise, it returns the index `mid` of the element in `p` that is just before the first element greater than or equal to `x`, or the index `l` if `p[l]` is equal to `x`.
