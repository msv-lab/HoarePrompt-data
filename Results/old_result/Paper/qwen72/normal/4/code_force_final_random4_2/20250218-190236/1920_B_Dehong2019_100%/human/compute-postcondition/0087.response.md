Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` must be greater than `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 2, `ans1` is now `a[1] + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value, which was `a[1] + a[2]`.
- The value of `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and its previous value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
