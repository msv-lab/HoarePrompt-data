Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 0.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the value of `tot` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
