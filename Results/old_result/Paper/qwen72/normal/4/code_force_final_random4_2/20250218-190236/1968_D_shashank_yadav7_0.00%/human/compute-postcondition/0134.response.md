The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is now `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is now `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is now `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is now `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is now `bp + a[b] + a[b]`**
