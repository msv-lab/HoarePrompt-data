Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `cur` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`; `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3; `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- Since `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.
- All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
- The values of `i` and `nums_left` are still `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1] - 3` respectively, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3.
