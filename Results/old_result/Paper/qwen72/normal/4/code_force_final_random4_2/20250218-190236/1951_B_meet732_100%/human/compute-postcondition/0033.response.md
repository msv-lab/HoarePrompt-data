Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9. `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, but currently, `ind` contains only one index. `c` is 2. `i` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, or `i` is `n-1` if fewer than two elements are greater than `x`. `n` is at least 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the first element of `ind` is not 0. The first element of `ind` is less than or equal to `k`.**
