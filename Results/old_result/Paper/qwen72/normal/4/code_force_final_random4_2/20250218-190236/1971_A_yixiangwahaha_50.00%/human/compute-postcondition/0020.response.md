Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` ten times.
3. `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` ten times.
4. `i` will be set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration.
5. `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is a list where each element is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, repeated ten times.
   - `y` is a list where each element is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`, repeated ten times.
   - For example, if `xylist = [10, 5]`, then `x = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]` and `y = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration.

3. **Condition `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`**:
   - This condition ensures that the value of `x[0]` is greater than or equal to `y[0]`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])` statement will print the value of `y[0]` followed by a space and then the value of `x[0]`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is 0, `y[i]` will be the first element of `y`, which is the integer value of the second element of `xylist`.
- Similarly, `x[i]` will be the first element of `x`, which is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`.
- Given the condition `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`, the print statement will output the values of `y[0]` and `x[0]` in the specified format.

### Final Output:
Output: **y[0] ' ' x[0] (where y[0] is the integer value of the second element of `xylist` and x[0] is the integer value of the first element of `xylist`, and x[0] is greater than or equal to y[0])**
