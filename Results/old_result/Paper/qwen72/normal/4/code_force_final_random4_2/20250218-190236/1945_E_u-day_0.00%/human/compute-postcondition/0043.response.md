The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.

Based on the provided information, the function returns the index of the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, the function's behavior is not specified, but typically such functions would return a specific value (like -1) to indicate that `k` is not in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It returns the index of `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is found. If `k` is not found, the behavior is unspecified.**
