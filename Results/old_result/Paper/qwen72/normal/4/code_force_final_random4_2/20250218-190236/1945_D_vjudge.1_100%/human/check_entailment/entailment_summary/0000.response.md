Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The function `func_1` attempts to solve this by calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position `i` within the first `m` positions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each person in the queue, the function calculates the minimum cost `c[i]` that Kirill would need to pay to move past person `i`. This is done by taking the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i`.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function then calculates the suffix sums of the `c` array. The suffix sum `suff[i]` represents the total cost of moving past all people from position `i` to the end of the queue. This is done in a loop that iterates from `n-1` to `0`.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates over the first `k` positions. For each position `i`, it calculates the total cost of moving to position `i` by adding `a[i]` (the cost to move to position `i`) and `suff[i + 1]` (the cost to move past all people from position `i+1` to the end). It updates `ans` with the minimum of these costs.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function prints the minimum cost `ans`.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

- **Cost Calculation**: The `c` array correctly stores the minimum cost for Kirill to move past each person. This is a valid step because Kirill can either pay `a[i]` to swap with person `i` or pay `b[i]` to move past person `i`.

- **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly calculated. It ensures that the total cost of moving past a range of people is efficiently computed.

- **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The loop that calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `k` positions is correct. It considers the cost of moving to each position `i` and the cost of moving past all subsequent positions.

- **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost, which is the correct output for the problem.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The input parameters are not modified, and the output is the minimum cost as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
