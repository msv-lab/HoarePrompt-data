Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `mid`, which is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` (which is 0) and `r` (which is `n`) by 2. Therefore, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`.
