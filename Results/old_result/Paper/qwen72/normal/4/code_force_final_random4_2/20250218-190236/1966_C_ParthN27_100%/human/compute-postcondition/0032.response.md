Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3, and `ans` is set to 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.***
