The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. For the loop to execute, `costs` must be a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This means `costs` is already non-empty, and the loop will execute at least once.

However, we need to specify the initial state of `i` for the first iteration of the loop. In the first iteration, `i` will take the value of the first element in `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
