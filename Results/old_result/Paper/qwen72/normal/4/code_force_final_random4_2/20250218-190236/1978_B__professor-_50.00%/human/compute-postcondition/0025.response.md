Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the new input integers. If the new `b <= a`, the condition `b <= a` holds. If the new `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the condition `b - a >= n` holds. If the new `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the condition `b - a < n` holds.***
