The value of `u` and `v` are each reduced by 2 before the code snippet is executed. The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the integer `u` to the list at index `v` in the `u2vs` list. This means that the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` now contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, and the list at index `u` still contains the integer `v` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 1, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 2`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 2`.**
