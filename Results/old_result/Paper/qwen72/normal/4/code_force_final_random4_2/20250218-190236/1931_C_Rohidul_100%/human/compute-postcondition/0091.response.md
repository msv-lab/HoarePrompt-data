Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the next element and `l` must be less than `le - 1`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > 1`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is updated to `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`.***
