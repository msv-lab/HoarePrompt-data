The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers (with the constraints 2 <= len(a) <= 50 and 1 <= a[i] <= 1,000,000). It checks if any subsequence of the list `a` repeated twice (i.e., `a + a`) is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
