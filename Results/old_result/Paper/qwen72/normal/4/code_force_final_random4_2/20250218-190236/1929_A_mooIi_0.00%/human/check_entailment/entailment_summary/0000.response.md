Reasoning:  
The given program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The provided program does not perform the second step and instead just prints the sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
