Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to `n`, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations `n`.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` now contains `n` strings, where each string was input during one of the loop iterations.
- The string `first_row` is composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a`, concatenated together.
- The string `last_row` is composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a`, concatenated together.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, reflecting the final value of the loop index after the loop has completed.
