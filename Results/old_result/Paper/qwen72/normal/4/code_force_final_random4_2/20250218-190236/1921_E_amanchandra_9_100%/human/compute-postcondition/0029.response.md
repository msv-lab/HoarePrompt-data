The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is increased by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a > c`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a <= c`, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Otherwise, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**
