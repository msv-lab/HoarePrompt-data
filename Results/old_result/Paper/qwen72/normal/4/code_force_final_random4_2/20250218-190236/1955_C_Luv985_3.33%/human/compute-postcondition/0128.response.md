Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `a[l]` is 0 or `0 - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is calculated as the remainder of `k` divided by 2 (`k % 2`).
- Since `k` is greater than `2 * mi`, `k` is an integer, and the remainder of `k` divided by 2 can be either 0 or 1.
- The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `a[0]`, `a[n - 1]`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
