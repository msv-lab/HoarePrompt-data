Functionality: ** The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the `target` node is found during the BFS, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the BFS completes and the `target` node is not found, it returns -1, indicating that the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node. **
