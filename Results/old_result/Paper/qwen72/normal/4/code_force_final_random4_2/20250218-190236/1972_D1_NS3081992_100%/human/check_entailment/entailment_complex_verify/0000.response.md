### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Loop Condition and Calculation:**
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not reflect the problem's requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked.
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to the smallest integer \(k\) such that \(k \cdot k > n + k\) or \(k > m\). This does not align with the problem's requirement to check all pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.

2. **Example Input:**
   - For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the current implementation does not correctly count these pairs.
   - The current implementation of `func_15` will not produce the correct output for this example. It will likely produce an incorrect count or an incorrect sum.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, the function should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A correct approach would involve nested loops to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and a condition to check the required multiple.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as specified in the problem description. The original assessment accurately identifies the issues with the implementation.
