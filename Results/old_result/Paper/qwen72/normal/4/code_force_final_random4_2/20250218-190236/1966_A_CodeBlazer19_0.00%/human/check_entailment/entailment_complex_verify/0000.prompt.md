You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `c` representing the numbers on the cards, and two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `2 <= k <= 100`. The list `c` should have a length of `n` and each element should be an integer such that `1 <= c_i <= 100`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `l`. It then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is the total number of test cases processed, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last input integers, and `l` is the last list of integers provided by the user.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program always prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect. The program does not consider the actual numbers on the cards or the number of cards with each number. It should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `5 3`
- Cards: `4 1 1 4 4`

The correct output should be `2` because you can perform the operation once by choosing the three `4`s and exchanging them for two new cards, leaving you with `1 1` and the two new cards. However, the program will output `2` for any input with `k = 3`, regardless of the actual card numbers and their counts. This is clearly incorrect for many cases.

Another example:
- Input: `7 2`
- Cards: `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`

The correct output should be `1` because you can perform the operation multiple times to reduce the number of cards to one. However, the program will output `1` for any input with `k = 2`, which is not always correct.

The program fails to handle the logic of the problem correctly and does not consider the actual card numbers or the number of cards with each number. Therefore, it is incorrect.
