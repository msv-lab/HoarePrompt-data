Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `n` is the number of elements in `N` minus 1, `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is equal to `mu * w`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cost = mu * w` calculates the value of `cost` by multiplying `mu` and `w`. The values of `mu` and `w` are already defined in the initial state, so `cost` is updated to the product of `mu` and `w`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
