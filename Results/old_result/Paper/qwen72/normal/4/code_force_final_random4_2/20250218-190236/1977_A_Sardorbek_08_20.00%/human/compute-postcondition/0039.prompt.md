You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 100, `i` is `a` - 1, and `q` is a tuple containing the final values of `b` and `c`. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `b` and `c` were provided by user input, and the loop checked the conditions: if `b` == `c`, it printed 'YES'; if `b` < `c`, it printed 'NO'; if `a` and `b` have the same parity, it printed 'Yes'; otherwise, it printed 'No'. After all iterations, the loop has completed `a` times, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function internally uses or generates values for `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 for each test case. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
