Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the program step by step, considering the problem description and the annotations provided.

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindrome:**
   ```python
   if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
       print('YES')
       print(1)
       print(s)
       return
   ```
   - This check is correct. If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, the program prints "YES" and the string itself as a valid partition. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       if s[i] != s[0]:
           x = i
           break
   ```
   - This loop correctly finds the index `x` of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`. If all characters are the same, `x` remains `-1`.

3. **Handling the Case Where All Characters Are the Same:**
   ```python
   if (x == -1) :
       print('NO')
       return
   ```
   - This check is correct. If all characters in `s` are the same, the string is a palindrome, and there is no way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings. The program prints "NO" and returns, which is correct.

4. **Checking the Substring After the First Non-Matching Character:**
   ```python
   if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
       print('YES')
       print(2)
       print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```
   - This check is correct. If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the program prints "YES" and the partition `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is a valid partition because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Handling Special Cases:**
   ```python
   else :
       if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
           print('NO')
       else :
           print('YES')
           print(2)
           print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
   ```
   - This part is where the program might have issues. The original assessment points out that the program does not handle the case where the string is a palindrome and has a length of 2. For example, if the input string is "aa":
     - `x` will be `-1` because all characters are the same.
     - The program will print "NO" and return, which is incorrect.
   - The program should handle this case by checking if the string length is 2 and all characters are the same, and then output "YES" with the string partitioned into two parts, each of length 1.

6. **Correcting the Special Case:**
   - The program should add a check for strings of length 2 with all characters the same:
     ```python
     if n == 2 and s[0] == s[1]:
         print('YES')
         print(2)
         print(s[0], ' ', s[1])
         return
     ```

Given the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the special case where the string is a palindrome of length 2. The program should be modified to include this check.

Final: **False**
