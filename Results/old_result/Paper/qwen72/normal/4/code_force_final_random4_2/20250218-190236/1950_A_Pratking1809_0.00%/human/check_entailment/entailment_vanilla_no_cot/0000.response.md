Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the placement of the `else` statement. The `else` is currently associated with the second `if` statement, which means that if the second `if` condition is not met, it will print "NONE" even if the first condition was met. This can lead to incorrect output in some cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the `elif` statement ensures that only one of the conditions is checked and printed, and the `else` statement is correctly placed to handle all other cases.
