The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `p`. The loop iterates over each character in `p`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `p` after 'B'. The string `p` is 'ABCDEFG', so the next character after 'B' is 'C'. The state of `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable being looped over.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`, and `i` is 'C'. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
