Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 2, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, and if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all other cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
