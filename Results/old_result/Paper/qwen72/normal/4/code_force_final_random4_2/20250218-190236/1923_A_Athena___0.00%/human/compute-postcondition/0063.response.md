The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must now be 2, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a)`, and `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.**
