Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where the input is provided in the form of multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The integers satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. `t` is the number of test cases, which is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a` > `c`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a` ≤ `c`, `x` is set to `(c - a) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a > c`, no changes are made to the variables. If `a <= c`, `x` is the integer part of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, and `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. Otherwise, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`, and `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user. If `a` > `c`, the variables retain their initial values. If `a` ≤ `c`, `x` is the integer result of `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
