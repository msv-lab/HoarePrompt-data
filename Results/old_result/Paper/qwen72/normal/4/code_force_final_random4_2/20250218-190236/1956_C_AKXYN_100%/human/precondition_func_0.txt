The function does not take any input parameters, but it is designed to work with multiple test cases where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.
