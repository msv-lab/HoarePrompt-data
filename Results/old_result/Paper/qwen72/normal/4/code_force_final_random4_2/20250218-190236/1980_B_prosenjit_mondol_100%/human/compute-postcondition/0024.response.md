Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the input.
   - `f` is the second integer provided by the input minus 1.
   - `k` is the third integer provided by the input minus 2.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the sorted list `a` is greater than `x`.
   - If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the integer at index `k` of the sorted list `a` is strictly less than `x`.
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the integer at index `k` of the sorted list `a` is exactly equal to `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string, regardless of the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
