Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` and `c` are input integers.
- `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`.

### Conditions:
- If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).
- If `b` and `c` have different parities, then `b` and `c` maintain their initial relationship (either `b` is equal to `c`, `b` is less than `c`, or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet `print('Yes')` simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state and conditions provided do not affect the execution of this print statement. They describe the values and relationships of variables `b` and `c`, but the print statement does not use these variables or any other variables from the initial state.

### Output:
The code prints the string `'Yes'`.
Output: **Yes**
