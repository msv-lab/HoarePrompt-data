The code snippet `print(x, y)` will print the values of the variables `x` and `y`.

Based on the initial state:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is greater than `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given conditions. The print statement will output the values of `x` and `y`, with `x` being greater than `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer greater than y and y is an integer)**
