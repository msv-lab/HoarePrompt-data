Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer where 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `numbers` is a list containing the sublist `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing numbers input by the user, `num1` is the integer value of the first element in `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element in `nums`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
