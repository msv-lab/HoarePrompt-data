Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs and prints the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell of a 2 Ã— n grid, and then prints the number of such paths. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, `j`, and `counter` are no longer in scope. **
