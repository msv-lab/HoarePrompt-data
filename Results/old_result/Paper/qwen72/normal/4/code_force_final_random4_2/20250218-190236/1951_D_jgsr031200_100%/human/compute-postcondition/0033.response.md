Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). It prints 'YES' and the numbers 1, 1, 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by `n - k + 1` and `1` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the numbers 2, and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. The function does not return any value. **
