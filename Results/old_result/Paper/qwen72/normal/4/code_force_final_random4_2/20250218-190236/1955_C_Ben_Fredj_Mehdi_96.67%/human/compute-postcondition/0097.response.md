An exception could occur at the points where the program attempts to access or modify the list `a` using the indices `g` and `d`. Specifically, if `g` or `d` are out of the valid range of indices for the list `a`, an `IndexError` would be raised. Additionally, if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` are not integers, a `ValueError` could be raised when trying to convert them to integers.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If any exception occurs during these operations, the `except` block is executed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the state of all variables unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
