Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all `m` iterations, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` contains all possible results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in the initial `ans`, depending on the value of `c` during each iteration. If `c` is '0', only the results of `(q + r) % n` are added to `ans`. If `c` is '1', only the results of `(q - r) % n` are added to `ans`. If `c` is '?', both results are added to `ans`. The loop counter `_` is equal to `m`. If `0` was an element in `ans`, it is no longer present, and `n` is now an element in `ans`. If `0` was not an element in `ans`, `ans` remains as described above.***
