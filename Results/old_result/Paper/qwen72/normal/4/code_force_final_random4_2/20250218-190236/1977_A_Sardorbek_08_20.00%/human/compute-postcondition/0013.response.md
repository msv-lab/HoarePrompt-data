Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `q` is a tuple containing the input integers `b` and `c`.
- `b` is not equal to `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
