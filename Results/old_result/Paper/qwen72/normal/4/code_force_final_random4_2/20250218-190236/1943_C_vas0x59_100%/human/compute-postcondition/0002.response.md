The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a specific integer value read from the standard input and must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `_` is a placeholder variable**
