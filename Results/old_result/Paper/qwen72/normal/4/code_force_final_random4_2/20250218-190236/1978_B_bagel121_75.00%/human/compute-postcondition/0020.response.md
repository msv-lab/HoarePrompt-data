The provided code snippet takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is `t - 1`, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values. Since the code snippet does not include the logic for updating `k`, `ans`, or `p2`, these variables remain unchanged if they were already defined, or they are not defined at all if they were not previously set.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged or undefined.**
