### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If `n` is equal to `m`, the program outputs "YES". This is correct because if Nikita makes exactly `n` moves and ends up with `m` cubes, it means he can achieve the desired tower height by simply adding `m` cubes one by one.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If `n` is less than `m`, the program outputs "NO". This is correct because Nikita cannot make more moves than the number of cubes he wants to end up with. If `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program outputs "Yes". This is correct because the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move (adding or removing a cube) changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower, and to end up with the same parity, the difference must be even.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If `n` and `m` have different parities, the program outputs "No". This is correct because if the parities are different, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the output format is inconsistent. The program outputs "YES" for one case and "No" for others. The problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive), so the output should be standardized to either all uppercase or all lowercase.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `3 3`, the program outputs "YES" (which is correct but should be "Yes" for consistency).
   - For the input `2 4`, the program outputs "NO" (which is correct).
   - For the input `5 3`, the program outputs "Yes" (which is correct).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are both 1, and other valid inputs within the specified range.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is **partially accurate**. The program does handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly, but it has an issue with inconsistent output formatting. However, the problem description allows for case-insensitive output, so the program is still functionally correct.

Given the functional correctness and the minor issue with output formatting, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True** (the program is correct, but the output formatting should be standardized for consistency).
