To determine what will be printed by the `print('0')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
   - `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `k` is 1999999998, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` are still satisfied.
   - If `k` is 1999999999 or 99999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` are still satisfied.
   - If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the first element of `a` is 1.
   - If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`.
   - If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1.
   - If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('0')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement `print('0')` is a simple statement that prints the string `'0'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the print statement because the print statement is not dependent on any of those variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
