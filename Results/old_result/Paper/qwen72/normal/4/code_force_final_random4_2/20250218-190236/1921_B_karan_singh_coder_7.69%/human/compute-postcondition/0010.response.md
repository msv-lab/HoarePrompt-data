Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `f` remains unchanged, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string representation of `t`, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains the same.**
