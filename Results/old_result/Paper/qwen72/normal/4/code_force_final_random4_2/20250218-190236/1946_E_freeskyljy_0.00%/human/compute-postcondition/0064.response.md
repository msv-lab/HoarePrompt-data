Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, and `L` remain unchanged. `nums_left` is updated to `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is 1. If `M2` is greater than 1, `i` is updated to `N`, `cur` is the number of elements in `R` that are less than `N`, and `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from the initial `nums_left` down to 1, excluding any values that were equal to `L[1]` during the loop execution, taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` is not greater than 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2` if `M1` is not greater than 1; otherwise, `cur` is updated to `M1 - (L[-1] - 1)` or `M1 - 2` depending on the number of times the if condition was true. `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 2) * (L[-1] - 3) * ... * 2 % MOD`, where the product includes all values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, excluding any values that were equal to `L[cur]` during the loop execution.**
