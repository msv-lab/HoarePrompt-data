You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list `A` of `2n` integers (each integer in the list satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`). The function sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `A`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `A`. Sorting is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**: The program then prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This is correct because, after sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller elements of each pair. By summing these elements, we are effectively summing the minimum values of each pair.

4. **Loop Control**: The program correctly decrements `t` after processing each test case and continues until all test cases are processed.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or the list contains repeated elements. For example, in the case where all elements are the same, the sum of the minimum values will be `n * a_i` where `a_i` is the repeated value.

6. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the program is \(O(t \cdot (2n \log 2n + n))\), which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).

7. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the maximum final score for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
