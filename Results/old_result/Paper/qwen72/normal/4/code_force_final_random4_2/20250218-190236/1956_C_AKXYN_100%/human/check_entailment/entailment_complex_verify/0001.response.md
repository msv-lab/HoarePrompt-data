### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values. Since the permutations are from 1 to \( n \), the maximum value in each row and column should be \( n \).
   - The sum of all elements in the matrix when each element is \( n \) is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program uses \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it performs:
     - A Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - A Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Effect of Operations:**
   - Each Type 1 operation on row \( i \) sets \( a_{i, j} = j \) for all \( j \).
   - Each Type 2 operation on column \( i \) sets \( a_{j, i} = j \) for all \( j \).
   - Since the permutations are the same for both types of operations, the matrix will be filled with the values from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column. However, this does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

5. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \). This sum calculation is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^3 \).
   - The correct sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both rows and columns, ensuring that each element in the matrix is \( n \).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations in the format specified.
   - The operations themselves are correct in terms of format and number, but they do not achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
- The program uses the correct number of operations and the correct format for the operations.
- However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^3 \).
- The operations performed do not maximize the sum of the matrix to \( n^3 \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it calculates the sum incorrectly and does not perform the operations in a way that maximizes the sum to \( n^3 \). The correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both rows and columns to ensure each element is \( n \).
