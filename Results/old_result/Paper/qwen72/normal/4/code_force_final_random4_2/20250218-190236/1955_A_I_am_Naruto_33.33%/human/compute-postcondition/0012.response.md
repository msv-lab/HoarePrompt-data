Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= t), and `a` and `b` are integers. `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` > 1, `ans1` is equal to `a * n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, `ans1` retains its original value (which was not defined in the initial state).**
