Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the standard input and are now `u - (n - 1)` and `v - (n - 1)` respectively.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- The list `u2vs` now contains `n` lists, where each list at index `i` represents the neighbors (connected nodes) of node `i` in a 0-indexed manner.
- The placeholder variable `_` has the value `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has run `n - 1` times.
- The variables `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the standard input, and they have been decremented by `n - 1` due to the loop's execution.
