The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might work with or return values related to the parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. Since the function definition does not include these parameters, it is likely that these values are used internally or the function returns a value based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates with internal parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
