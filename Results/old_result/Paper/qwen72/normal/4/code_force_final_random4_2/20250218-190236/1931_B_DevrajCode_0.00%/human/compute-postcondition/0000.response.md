Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in list `a`.** 

The value of `total_water` is now the sum of all the elements in the list `a`, which is a positive integer. The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and this property remains unchanged.
