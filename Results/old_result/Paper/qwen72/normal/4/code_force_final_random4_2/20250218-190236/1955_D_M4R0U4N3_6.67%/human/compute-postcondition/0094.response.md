Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition. If `a[2]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[2]`, `done` includes `a[2]`, and `extra` remains empty. Otherwise, `extra` is updated to include `a[2]`, `todo` remains unchanged, and `done` remains empty.**
