Output State: **The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` and `m` are now integers provided by the user input, and `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.**
