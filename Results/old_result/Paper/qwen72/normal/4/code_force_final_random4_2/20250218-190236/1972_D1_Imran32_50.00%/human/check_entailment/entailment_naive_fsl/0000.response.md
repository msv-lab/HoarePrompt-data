Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). Instead, it seems to be performing a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem statement.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`. The valid pairs (a, b) should be (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs. However, the program does not handle this correctly and would produce a different output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
