Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, and `_` is incremented by `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `cnt` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in the strings `s` and `t` differ.
- The variable `_` will be incremented by `n`, as it is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `f`, `s1`, `t1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
