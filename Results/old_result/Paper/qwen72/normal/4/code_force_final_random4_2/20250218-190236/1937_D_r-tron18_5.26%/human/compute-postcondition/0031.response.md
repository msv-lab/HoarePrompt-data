Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list with elements [0, `n`], `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the last character of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns a value to `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`.
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` is called with `suffZero` and `ol + 1` as arguments, and `func_1(suffZero, 1)` is called with `suffZero` and `1` as arguments.
- The result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` is assigned to `zeroInd`.
- The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `zr` is greater than `ol` still holds.
- The new variable `zeroInd` is introduced with the calculated value.
