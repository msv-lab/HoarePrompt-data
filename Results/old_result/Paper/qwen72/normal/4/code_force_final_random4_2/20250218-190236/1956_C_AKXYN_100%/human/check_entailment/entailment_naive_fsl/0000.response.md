Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, for `n = 1`, the maximum sum should be 1, and the number of operations should be 1. However, the program outputs `1 2` (indicating 2 operations), which is incorrect. The program should output `1 1` and a single operation for `n = 1`.

For `n = 1`, the expected output should be:
```
1 1
1 1 1
```

But the program outputs:
```
1 2
1 1 1
2 1 1
```

This violates the problem description, which states that the number of operations should be no more than `2n`, but in this case, it should be exactly 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
