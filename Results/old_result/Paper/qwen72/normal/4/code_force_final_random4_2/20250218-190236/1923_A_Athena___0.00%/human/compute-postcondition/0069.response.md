The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[0] == 0`. The loop will execute again if `a` is non-empty and its first element is 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the new input with the first element removed, and `i` is the length of the new `a` minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be non-empty and its first element must be 0.

Since `a` is already non-empty and has had its first element removed, for the loop to execute again, the first element of `a` must now be 0.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the new input with the first element removed and the new first element must be 0, `i` is the length of the new `a` minus 1, `res` is 0**
