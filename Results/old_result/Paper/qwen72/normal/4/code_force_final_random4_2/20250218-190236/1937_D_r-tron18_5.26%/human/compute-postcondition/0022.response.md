Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of occurrences of '>' in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with an initial value of 0, but now with the last element removed, `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, if `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), then the last element of `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `zeroInd` is 0), and `i` is `n - 2`, `ol` is 0. Otherwise, if `ol` is greater than `zr`, then `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`) is `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), `i` remains `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne` minus 1, and `zr` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `totalOne` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `totalOne - 1`.
- The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `zr`) remain unchanged, but the updated value of `totalOne` may affect the conditions that depend on it.
