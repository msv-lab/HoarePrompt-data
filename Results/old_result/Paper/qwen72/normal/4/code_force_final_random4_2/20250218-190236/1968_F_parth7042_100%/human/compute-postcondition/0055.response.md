Output State: **`index` is `7 + n`, `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3, `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` is 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `v1 = mp[pf[r]]` updates the variable `v1` to be the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
