Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` has been decremented by 1, but it doesn't affect the other variables.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers: This means that `n` and `a` are integers provided as input.
- `k`, `ans`, and `p2` remain unchanged or undefined: These variables are not used in the code snippet, so they are irrelevant to the output.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * a)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement multiplies the integer `n` by the integer `a` and prints the result.
- Since `n` and `a` are input integers, the exact values of `n` and `a` are not specified in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output will be the product of `n` and `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n * a (where n and a are the input integers)**
