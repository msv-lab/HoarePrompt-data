Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as input, where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        x = 0
        y = p3
        while y >= x:
            if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                print(p1 - x + p3)
                break
            else:
                x += 1
                y -= 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`. If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`. If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. If none of these conditions are met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and `p3` is printed. `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is incremented and `y` is decremented in each iteration, starting from `x = 0` and `y = p3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues with the same values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and `p1 - x + p3` is printed. Otherwise, the loop completes, and `p3` is printed. After all iterations, `x` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `y` is `p3 - x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
