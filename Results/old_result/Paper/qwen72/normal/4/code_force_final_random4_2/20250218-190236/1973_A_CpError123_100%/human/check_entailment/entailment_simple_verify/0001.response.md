### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and it prints `-1`.
   - This is correct because in every game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw) is always even. Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - This calculation is correct because `x` represents the total number of games played, and each game awards 2 points.
   - The function calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores `a + b`.
   - This calculation is intended to represent the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores. However, this is not entirely accurate.

4. **Understanding the Calculations:**
   - `x` correctly represents the total number of games played.
   - `y` represents the sum of the two smallest scores, but this does not necessarily represent the maximum number of draws. The maximum number of draws should be the minimum of the total number of games and the number of games that could have ended in draws without exceeding the individual scores.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the scores are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given game rules.
   - For valid scores, the function's logic to print the minimum of `x` and `y` is flawed. The correct approach should be to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games and that the individual scores are consistent with the number of draws.

### Correctness:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in all cases. Specifically, the calculation of `y` as `a + b` is not always the maximum number of draws. The correct approach should be to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games and that the individual scores are consistent with the number of draws.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
