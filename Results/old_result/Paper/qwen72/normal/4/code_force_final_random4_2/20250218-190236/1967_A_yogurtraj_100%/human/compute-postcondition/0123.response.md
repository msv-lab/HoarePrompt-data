Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % (n - 1)`, `k` is not 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[n-2] + k // (n - 1)` if the loop breaks due to the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is not 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[n-1]`.**
