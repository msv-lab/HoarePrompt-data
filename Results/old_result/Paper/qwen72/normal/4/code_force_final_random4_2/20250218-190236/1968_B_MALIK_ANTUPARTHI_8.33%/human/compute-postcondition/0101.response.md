Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `j` is the index where the loop was broken or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the last updated value of `k` based on the loop's execution.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The variable `j` will be the index where the loop was broken if the loop exited early due to a break condition. If the loop completed all iterations, `j` will be equal to `b`.
- The variable `k` will be the last value it was updated to during the loop's execution. This value is determined by the conditions inside the loop:
  - If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.
  - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and the loop breaks.
  - If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.
- The loop iterates through the range of `b`, and the conditions inside the loop determine when and how `k` and `j` are updated. The loop will break if any of the break conditions are met, otherwise, it will complete all iterations.
