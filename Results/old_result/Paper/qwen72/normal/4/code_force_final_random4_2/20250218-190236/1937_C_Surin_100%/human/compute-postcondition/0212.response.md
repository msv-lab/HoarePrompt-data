Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is the final value of `n`, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following state is true:
- The lambda function `R` remains unchanged and still reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- The variable `kp` remains 2.
- The variable `n` is the final value of `n` (i.e., the number of iterations the loop was set to run).
- The variable `g` remains 0.
- The variable `v1` remains `n-1`.
- The loop variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variable `v2` remains `n-1`.
- The variable `r` is the new input string read during the last iteration.
- The variable `prev` will be `n-1` if the input `r` was '>' during the last iteration, or if `r` was '=' and the subsequent input `r2` was '<'. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, ensuring that all print statements have been executed.
