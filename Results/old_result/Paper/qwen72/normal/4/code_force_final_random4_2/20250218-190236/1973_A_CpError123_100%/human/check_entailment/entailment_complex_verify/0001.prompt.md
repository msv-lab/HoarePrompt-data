You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged, `t` is 0, and for each iteration that was executed, `a`, `b`, and `c` were integers provided by the user, `x` was `(a + b + c) // 2`, and `y` was `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` was odd for any iteration, the program printed `-1` and continued to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program printed the minimum of `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, representing the scores of three players. If the sum of these scores is odd, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum by 2 and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`. The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c` unchanged for each iteration, and `t` is reduced to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and it prints `-1`.
   - This is because in every game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw) is always even. Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The function calculates `x` as half of the total points `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - It calculates `y` as the sum of the two smallest scores `a + b`.
   - The function then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

4. **Understanding the Calculations:**
   - `x` represents the total number of games played, since each game awards 2 points.
   - `y` represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened between the two players with the smallest scores. This is because in the worst case, all games involving the two smallest scores could have ended in draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the scores are all zero, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - If the scores are such that the total points are odd, the function correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given game rules.
   - For valid scores, the function correctly calculates the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games or the sum of the two smallest scores.

### Correctness:
The program is correct because it handles all the edge cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The calculations and conditions are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
