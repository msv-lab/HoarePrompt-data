Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and it must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is equal to `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1] and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation:
- `q` is assigned the value of the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `k` is equal to `L[2]`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The ceiling function rounds up the result of the division `k / m` to the nearest integer.
