Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` now contains `a[m]`, `ans` remains unchanged, `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]`, and `done` no longer contains `a[m]`. Otherwise, `todo` and `done` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.***
