The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). After processing each test case, the function prints either `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` otherwise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` retain their last values from the final iteration, and `t` remains unchanged.
