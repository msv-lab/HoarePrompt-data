### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` (the number of elements, the number of elements Alice can remove, and the number of elements Bob can negate, respectively).
   - It reads the list of `n` integers `a` and sorts it.
   - It then calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.

2. **Optimal Strategy Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` takes `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` as parameters.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in the list.
   - It initializes `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list.
   - It creates a list `pos` to store potential sums after Alice's and Bob's moves.
   - The first element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, which represents the sum after Bob negates the largest `negatives` elements.
   - The function then iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), simulating Alice's removal of elements from the end of the sorted list.
   - For each removal, it updates `s` and `s2` and appends the new potential sum `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

### Analysis:
- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. Since the list is sorted, removing elements from the end (largest elements) is not optimal. However, the function `func_2` correctly simulates removing elements from the end, which is a mistake. Alice should remove elements from the beginning of the sorted list.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the sum after negating the largest `negatives` elements.
- **Combination of Strategies**: The function `func_2` correctly combines the strategies by considering the sum after Alice's removals and Bob's negations, but it should be adjusted to remove elements from the beginning of the sorted list.

### Correctness:
- The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it removes elements from the end of the sorted list, which is not optimal for Alice. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
- Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
