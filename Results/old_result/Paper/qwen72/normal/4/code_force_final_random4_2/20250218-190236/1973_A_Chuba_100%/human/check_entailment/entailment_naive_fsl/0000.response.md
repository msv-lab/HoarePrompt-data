Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It checks if the total score is odd, in which case it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw). If the total score is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible points that could be gained without draws and then dividing by 2. This logic ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for valid scores and returns `-1` for invalid scores. The program also correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
