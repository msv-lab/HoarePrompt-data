Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder variable, `i` is 1, `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the original `ans2`, `ans1` is now equal to the original `ans1` minus `2 * a[i + x]`.**
