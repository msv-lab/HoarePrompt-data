### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed. This is correct and necessary.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given the constraint that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day. This is correct.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form a new list `N`. This ensures that the cheapest days are considered first. This is correct.

6. **Handling Exact Multiples:**
   - If the total number of tickets `k` is exactly `n * m`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is correct because:
     - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. This is derived from the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers, which represents the cumulative price increase.

7. **Handling Non-Exact Multiples:**
   - If `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`, the program pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day among the selected days) and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` to be bought on that day.
   - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. Let's break down this formula:
     - `mu * w` accounts for the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the most expensive day.
     - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the remaining `n-1` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on the first `n-1` days.
     - `n * m * mu` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase on the most expensive day.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the formula `n * m * mu`. This term is incorrect because it assumes that the price increase on the most expensive day is `n * m`, which is not necessarily true. The price increase should be based on the number of tickets bought on previous days, not just the number of days.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case and continues to the next test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is correct for the case when `k` is an exact multiple of `m`.
- The formula `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect for the case when `k` is not an exact multiple of `m`. The term `n * m * mu` should be adjusted to correctly account for the price increase on the most expensive day.

### Corrected Formula:
- For the non-exact multiple case, the correct formula should be:
  - `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + (n - 1) * m * mu`
  - Here, `(n - 1) * m * mu` correctly accounts for the price increase on the most expensive day, as the price increase is based on the number of tickets bought on previous days, which is `(n - 1) * m`.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has an issue with the formula used in the non-exact multiple case. The term `n * m * mu` should be replaced with `(n - 1) * m * mu` to correctly account for the price increase.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed formula in the non-exact multiple case.
