The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `q` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0. If `upper` > `lower`, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` > `lower`. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the condition `upper` ≤ `lower`.**
