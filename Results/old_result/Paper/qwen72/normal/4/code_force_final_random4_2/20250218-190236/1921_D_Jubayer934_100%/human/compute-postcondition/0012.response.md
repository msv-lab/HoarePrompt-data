The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `temp` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and `i` is 1**
