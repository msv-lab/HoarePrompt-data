#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

    #State: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9). Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `nums`, and `ans` is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were each less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, a positive integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` positive integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it returns the total count of elements from the start and the end of the list `nums` that contribute to partial sums (`s_a` and `s_b`) which are each less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2`, respectively.
