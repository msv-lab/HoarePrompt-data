The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the set `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still contain at least one more integer that hasn't been iterated over yet. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last integer in `cx` that was processed. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next integer in `cx`.

Given that `i` is an element of `cx` and `cx` must contain at least one more integer for the loop to execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing at least one integer, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `i` is the next integer in `cx` that has not been processed yet, and `tmp` remains 0 unless `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, in which case `tmp` is 1.**
