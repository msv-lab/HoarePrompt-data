Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` and two binary strings `d` and `e`. It then processes these strings to find the index `k` where the substring of `d` up to `k` can be found in `e` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a - 1`, `b` is the last read integer representing the length of the binary string `d`, `c` is the last read integer, `d` is the last read binary string, `e` is the last read binary string, and `k` is the last computed index. **
