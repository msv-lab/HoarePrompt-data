Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `el` is the element at index `i` in the string or list `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.** 

The variables `i`, `n`, and `el` remain unchanged. The new variables `ol` and `zr` are introduced, with `ol` being assigned the value of `totalOne` and `zr` being assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`.
