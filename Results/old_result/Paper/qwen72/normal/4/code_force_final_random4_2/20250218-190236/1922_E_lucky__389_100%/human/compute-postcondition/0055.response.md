Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2` and `mx` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `mx` and `i - 1`.***
