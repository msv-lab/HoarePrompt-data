Output State: **`t` is an input string representing a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `t` on spaces, `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `xylist` three times, `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second element of `xylist` three times, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the integer value of the second element of `xylist` to the list `y`.
- Initially, `y` contains the integer value of the second element of `xylist` twice.
- After appending, `y` now contains the integer value of the second element of `xylist` three times.
- The values of `t`, `xylist`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
