Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `c` is an input string that must contain at least three characters.
- `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
- `x` is the third character in `c`.
- `no` remains True.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
