Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9 and are assigned the values from the input, `q` is an input integer, `mn` is 100, `i` is `q - 1`. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b > c` is true. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true. If neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, then both conditions are false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks the relationship between these digits and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input integer `q` and the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are processed, and the final state of the program is that the results of the comparisons have been printed for all test cases.
