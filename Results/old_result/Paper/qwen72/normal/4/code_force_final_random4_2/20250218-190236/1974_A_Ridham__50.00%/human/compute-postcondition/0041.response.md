Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `space_x` is equal to the new value of `x`, `space_y` is equal to the new value of `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to the new value of `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to the new value of `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to the new value of `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If the new value of `space_x` is less than or equal to the new value of `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that includes the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list that includes the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
