Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters (either '0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string that contains at least one '1', and `int(input())` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, this condition is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. `int(input())` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this relationship holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1', and the length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. If the count of '1' characters in the first input string is equal to the count of '1' characters in the second input string, then this condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
