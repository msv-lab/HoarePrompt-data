### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\), but the variable name is incorrect).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the integer part of the square root of \(n\) and stores it in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root + 1`, and for each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` is described as performing a calculation that is unrelated to the problem statement. It sums up a series of terms derived from \(n\) and its square root, which does not match the required logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Validation**:
   - Let's consider the example input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - The valid pairs \((a, b)\) should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs.
     - However, the program does not handle this correctly. It calculates `ans` as follows:
       - `ans = 2`
       - `root = int(math.sqrt(2)) + 1 = 2`
       - For \(i = 2\):
         - `cnt = 2 * 2 = 4`
         - `ans += (2 + 2) // 4 = 4 // 4 = 1`
         - `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - The program prints `3`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific input, but the logic is incorrect and will not work for other inputs.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
     - The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), which gives a total of 14 valid pairs.
     - However, the program calculates `ans` as follows:
       - `ans = 10`
       - `root = int(math.sqrt(10)) + 1 = 4`
       - For \(i = 2\):
         - `cnt = 2 * 2 = 4`
         - `ans += (10 + 2) // 4 = 12 // 4 = 3`
         - `ans = 10 + 3 = 13`
       - For \(i = 3\):
         - `cnt = 3 * 3 = 9`
         - `ans += (10 + 3) // 9 = 13 // 9 = 1`
         - `ans = 13 + 1 = 14`
       - For \(i = 4\):
         - `cnt = 4 * 4 = 16`
         - `ans += (10 + 4) // 16 = 14 // 16 = 0`
         - `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`
     - The program prints `14`, which is correct for this specific input, but the logic is still incorrect and will not work for other inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` performs a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
