Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `inds` is an element of `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `q` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` if such an index exists, otherwise `lower` is 0.
   - `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r` if such an index exists, otherwise `upper` is 0.
   - If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the `continue` statement has been executed, and the loop or conditional block will proceed to the next iteration or step.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement itself.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'No'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
