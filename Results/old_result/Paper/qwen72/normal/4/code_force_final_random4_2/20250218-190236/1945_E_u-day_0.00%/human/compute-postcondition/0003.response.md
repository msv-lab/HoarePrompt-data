To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n` that are present in the loop head. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for completeness, we can include the state of `arr` and `pos` as they were provided, but we will not modify them.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`, `pos` is -1**
