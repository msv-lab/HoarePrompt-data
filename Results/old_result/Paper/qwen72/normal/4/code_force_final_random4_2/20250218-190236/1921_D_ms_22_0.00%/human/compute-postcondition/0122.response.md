Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and the index of the element in `b` within `item` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`. `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`. `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[tp2]`). `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
