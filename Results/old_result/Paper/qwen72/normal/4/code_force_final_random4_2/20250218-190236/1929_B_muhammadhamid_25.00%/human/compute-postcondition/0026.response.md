Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers where `n` represents the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). If `k` is 1, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 * n, the condition `k <= 2 * n` is true. If `k` is greater than 2 * n, the condition `k > 2 * n` is true.***
