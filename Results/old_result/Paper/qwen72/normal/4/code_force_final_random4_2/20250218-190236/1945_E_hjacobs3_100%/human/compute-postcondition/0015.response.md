Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is (l + r) // 2, `r - l` must be greater than 1**

The value of `mid` has been updated to `(l + r) // 2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
