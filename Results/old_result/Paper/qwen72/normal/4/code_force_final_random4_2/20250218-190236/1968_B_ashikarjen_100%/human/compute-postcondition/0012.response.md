Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, and `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0:** These conditions remain unchanged because the loop does not modify `n` or `i`.
- **`j` is `m`:** The loop increments `j` by 1 each time it executes. The loop will stop when `j` reaches `m` or when `b[j]` equals `a[i]`. Since the loop executed `m` times, `j` must have reached `m` without finding a match.
- **`b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`:** This means that none of the elements in the array `b` from index 0 to `m-1` are equal to `a[0]`. If any of these elements were equal to `a[0]`, the loop would have stopped before `j` reached `m`.
