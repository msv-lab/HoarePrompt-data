Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variables `c` and `r` are now assigned the values provided by the user input, which are integers.
- The condition for `num` remains the same: if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.
