Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 5, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 31, `dp[5]` is 63.**

Explanation:
- `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `(5 + 3 * 3 * 2) % 1000000007 = (5 + 18) % 1000000007 = 23 % 1000000007 = 23`.
- `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `(31 + 4 * 5 * 2) % 1000000007 = (31 + 40) % 1000000007 = 71 % 1000000007 = 71`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
