Postcondition: ***`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers input by the user. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, no changes are made to `v`. If the sum is even, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.***
