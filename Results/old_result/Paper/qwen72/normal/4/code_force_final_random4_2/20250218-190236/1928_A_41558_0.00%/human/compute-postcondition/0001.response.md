The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it. The state of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0**
