Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is a set containing at least one more integer in addition to `x`. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `q` is the next integer in the set `ans`. `temp` is a set containing the integers `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is not '0' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, and now it also contains `(q - r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged.
