Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- `p1` is calculated as the difference between the first element of the second tuple and the first element of the first tuple in the sorted list `coord`.
- `p2` is calculated as the difference between the first element of the fourth tuple and the first element of the third tuple in the sorted list `coord`.
- The values of `total`, `coord`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
