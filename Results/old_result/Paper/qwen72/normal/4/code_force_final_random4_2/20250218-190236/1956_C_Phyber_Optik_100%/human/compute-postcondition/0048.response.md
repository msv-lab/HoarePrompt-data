To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is that `i` must be in the range from 2 to `n + 1` (exclusive). 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for i in range(2, n + 1)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
4. The loop condition requires that `i` must be less than `n + 1` for the next iteration to occur.
5. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2, `i` is 3, `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**
