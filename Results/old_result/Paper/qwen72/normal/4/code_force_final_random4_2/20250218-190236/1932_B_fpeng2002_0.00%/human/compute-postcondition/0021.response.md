The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is 0, and `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` is now 1.
- `nums` must still have at least 1 integer, but since `x` is now 1, `nums` must have at least 2 integers for the loop to continue.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is 1, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`**
