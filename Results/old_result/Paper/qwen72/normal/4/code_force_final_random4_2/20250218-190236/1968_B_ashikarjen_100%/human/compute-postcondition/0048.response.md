To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `j` is the smallest index in `b` such that `b[j]` matches `a[i]` for the last `i` where `b[j] == a[i]` and `j < m`, or `j` is `m` if no such match is found.
   - `k` is the number of matches found between `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists.
   - `n` is the length of list `a`.
   - `m` is the length of list `b`.
   - `i` is the last index of list `a`.
   - `j` is the smallest index in list `b` where `b[j]` matches `a[i]` for the last valid `i` where `j < m`. If no such match is found, `j` is `m`.
   - `k` is the count of matches found between `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the number of matches found between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the number of matches found between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of matches found between the elements of `a` and `b` up to the last valid `i` where `j < m`)**
