The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - 2`, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
