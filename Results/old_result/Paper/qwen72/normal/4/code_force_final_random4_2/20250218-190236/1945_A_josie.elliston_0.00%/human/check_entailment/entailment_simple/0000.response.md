### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts Handling:**
   - Each introvert must have their own tent. This is straightforward and is handled by adding `introverts` directly to the total number of tents.

2. **Extroverts and Universals Handling:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. This means we need to ensure that the total number of people (extroverts + universals) can be divided into groups of 3.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts can be divided into groups of 3, and if not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form groups of 3.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the remaining extroverts plus the universals cannot form a complete group of 3, the function returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts according to their preferences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The condition `if (extroverts % 3 != 0) and (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3)` ensures that if there are leftover extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3 != 0`), there must be enough universals to form a complete group of 3. If this condition is not met, the function returns `None`.
   - If the condition is met, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no participants (`0 0 0`) correctly by returning 0.
   - It also handles the case where there are only introverts (`7 0 0`) correctly by returning the number of introverts.
   - For the case where there are only extroverts (`0 24 0`), it correctly returns 8, as 24 extroverts can be divided into 8 groups of 3.
   - For the case where there are more extroverts than universals can accommodate (`1 4 1`), it correctly returns -1, as it is impossible to form a group of 3 for the last extrovert.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description. It ensures that introverts have their own tents, and it checks if extroverts and universals can be accommodated in groups of 3. If it is impossible, it returns -1.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
