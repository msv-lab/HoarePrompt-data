### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is a helper function that assigns values to the vertices and determines the clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the starting index, ending index, and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - It assigns values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and the number of elements not in the middle `not_mid`.
   - It fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays accordingly:
     - For the first half of the range, it assigns increasing values from `small_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.
     - For the second half of the range, it assigns decreasing values from `big_element` to `arr` and sets the corresponding `cliquess` values to the current clique number.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned to a clique, and the number of cliques is minimized.
   - **Vertex Assignment:**
     - The `make_array` function ensures that the values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range [1, n].
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - **Edge Condition:**
     - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \), but the way vertices are assigned and partitioned into cliques ensures that this condition is met. This is because the values are assigned in a way that minimizes the differences between adjacent vertices within each clique.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by assigning values to vertices and partitioning them into the minimum number of cliques. The logic for assigning values and ensuring the edge condition is met is sound.

Correctness: **True**
