To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `ss` and the string `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is non-empty, as it iterates over each character in `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `i` is 2 if `cnt` >= `n` or `i` is `k` if `cnt` < `n`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- If `cnt` < `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each of which is the character obtained by adding `k - 1` to the ASCII value of 'a', and `ans` is now one character longer with the character `tmp` appended to it, followed by `n - cnt - 1` characters 'a'.

Since `s` is already specified as non-empty, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `ss` will take the value of the first character in `s` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `ss` is the first character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character in `s`**
