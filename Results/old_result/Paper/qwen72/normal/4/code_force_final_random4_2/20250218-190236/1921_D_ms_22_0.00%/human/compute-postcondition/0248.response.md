Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b`. The function prints the result for each test case. If the program is not executed as the main module, no changes are made to the variables. **
