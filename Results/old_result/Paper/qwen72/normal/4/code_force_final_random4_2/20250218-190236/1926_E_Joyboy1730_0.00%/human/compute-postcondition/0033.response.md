Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - (L[0] + a)`, `L` has at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L` + `a`, `pow` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
