Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `x` is equal to the integer division of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` by 2, `y` is equal to `a + b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`. The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` must be even for the current iteration to continue.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
