Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1.***
