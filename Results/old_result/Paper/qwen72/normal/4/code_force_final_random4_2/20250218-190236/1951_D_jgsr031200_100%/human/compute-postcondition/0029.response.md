Let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \neq k\).
- \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs` before the loop starts.
- `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `costs`**:
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first element of `costs` is \(n - k + 1\).
   - The second element of `costs` is 1.

2. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in `costs`.
   - The quotient of `n` divided by the first element \(n - k + 1\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The quotient of `n` divided by the second element 1 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor = n\).
   - Therefore, `h` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n\).

3. **Calculate the new `n`**:
   - The new `n` is the remainder after subtracting the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient from the initial `n`.
   - The product of the first element \(n - k + 1\) and its quotient \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) is \((n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The product of the second element 1 and its quotient \(n\) is \(1 \times n = n\).
   - The new `n` is \(n - ((n - k + 1) \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n)\).

4. **Simplify the new `n`**:
   - Let \(q_1 = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\).
   - The new `n` is \(n - ((n - k + 1) \times q_1 + n)\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(n - (n - k + 1) \times q_1 - n = - (n - k + 1) \times q_1\).
   - Since \(q_1 = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\), the remainder when \(n\) is divided by \(n - k + 1\) is \(n \mod (n - k + 1)\).
   - Therefore, the new `n` is \(n \mod (n - k + 1)\).

5. **Check the value of `h`**:
   - `h` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + n\).
   - Since \(n \geq k\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `h` is at least \(1 + n\), which is always greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final Output:
The code snippet `print(2)` will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Output: **2**
