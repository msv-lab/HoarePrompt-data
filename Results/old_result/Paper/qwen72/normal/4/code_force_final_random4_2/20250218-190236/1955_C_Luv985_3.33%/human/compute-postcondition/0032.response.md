Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1, `r` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to 1, and `a[0]` remains 0. If `a[n - 1]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is updated to 1, and `a[n - 1]` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
