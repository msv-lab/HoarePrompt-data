Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values of the three integers provided by the input, `R` is a list of integers provided by the input, `L` is a list of integers provided by the input, and `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**
