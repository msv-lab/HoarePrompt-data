Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, this is a precondition).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

The print statement is:
```
print(n * a)
```

Explanation:
- The print statement will output the result of multiplying the integer `n` by the integer `a`.
- Since `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and both `n` and `a` are input integers, the exact value of `n * a` depends on the specific values of `n` and `a` provided as input.
- Without specific values for `n` and `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are input integers and a is greater than or equal to b)**
