### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to minimize the number of cards left in the hand after performing a series of operations where we can exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers.
   - The key to solving this problem is to consider the frequency of each card number and how many times we can perform the exchange operation for each frequency.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `l`.
   - The function prints `k - 1` for each test case.

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - The solution provided does not take into account the actual card numbers or their frequencies.
   - It assumes that the minimum number of cards left after any number of operations is always `k - 1`, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the frequency of each card number when divided by `k`. The sum of these remainders will give the minimum number of cards left.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each card number, calculate its frequency.
   - For each frequency, determine how many cards are left after performing the exchange operation as many times as possible.
   - The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of the remainders of each frequency when divided by `k`.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first test case: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `l = [4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`
     - Frequency of 4: 3 (can be exchanged once, leaving 0 cards)
     - Frequency of 1: 2 (cannot be exchanged, leaving 2 cards)
     - Minimum cards left: 2
   - For the second test case: `n = 1`, `k = 10`, `l = [7]`
     - Frequency of 7: 1 (cannot be exchanged, leaving 1 card)
     - Minimum cards left: 1
   - For the fourth test case: `n = 10`, `k = 4`, `l = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Frequency of 1: 10 (can be exchanged 2 times, leaving 2 cards)
     - Minimum cards left: 2 (not 3 as the solution suggests)

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it always prints `k - 1` without considering the actual card numbers and their frequencies. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
