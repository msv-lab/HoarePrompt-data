Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 2
```
Here, `x = 7` and `n = 2`. The only way to split 7 into 2 sub-problems is to have difficulties 1 and 6, or 2 and 5, or 3 and 4. In all cases, the GCD is 1. However, the program will incorrectly output a value greater than 1 because it does not handle the prime number case properly.
