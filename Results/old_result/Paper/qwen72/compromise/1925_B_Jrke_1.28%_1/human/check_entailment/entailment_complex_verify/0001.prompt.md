You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The loop has printed the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k (x // n) for each iteration, where k is the integer division of x by n. If k is 1, the loop prints 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from input. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`. If `x // n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest such divisor. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the average difficulty of the sub-problems if they were all of equal difficulty.
   - If `k == 1`, it means that the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, so the GCD is 1.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - The loop iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x` in steps of 2 (to only consider odd divisors).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum value among the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing 1, which is the correct GCD.
   - The loop iterates over possible divisors of `x` to find the maximum GCD that can be achieved.
   - The loop only considers odd divisors if `x` is odd, which is a valid optimization since even divisors would not change the GCD if `x` is odd.
   - The program correctly updates `ans` to the maximum GCD that can be achieved by checking both `i` and `x // i` and ensuring they are less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, as the only possible GCD is 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is a composite number and `n` is 1, as the GCD is `x` itself.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The loop runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The program avoids unnecessary checks by only considering divisors that are less than or equal to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient approach to find the solution.
