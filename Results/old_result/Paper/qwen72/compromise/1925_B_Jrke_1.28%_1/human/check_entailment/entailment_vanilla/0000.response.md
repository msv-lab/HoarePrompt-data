### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the average difficulty of the sub-problems if they were all of equal difficulty.
   - If `k == 1`, it means that the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, so the GCD is 1.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - The loop iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x` in steps of 2 (to only consider odd divisors).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum value among the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing 1, which is the correct GCD.
   - The loop iterates over possible divisors of `x` to find the maximum GCD that can be achieved.
   - The loop only considers odd divisors if `x` is odd, which is a valid optimization since even divisors would not change the GCD if `x` is odd.
   - The program correctly updates `ans` to the maximum GCD that can be achieved by checking both `i` and `x // i` and ensuring they are less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, as the only possible GCD is 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is a composite number and `n` is 1, as the GCD is `x` itself.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The loop runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The program avoids unnecessary checks by only considering divisors that are less than or equal to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient approach to find the solution.

Correctness: **True**
