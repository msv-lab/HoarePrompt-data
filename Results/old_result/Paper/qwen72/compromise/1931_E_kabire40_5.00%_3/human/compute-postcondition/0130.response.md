Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together, with `val_in` (the first element of `rev_val`) reversed and appended to the end. `val_in` is the first element of `rev_val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` appends the reversed string of `val_in` to `rev_res`.
- `val_in` is the first element of `rev_val`, and its reversed string is appended to `rev_res`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
