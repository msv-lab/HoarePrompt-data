Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + (len(rev_val) - 1), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, and `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the string representations of the integer values of the elements at even indices in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the elements at odd indices in `rev_val`. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
