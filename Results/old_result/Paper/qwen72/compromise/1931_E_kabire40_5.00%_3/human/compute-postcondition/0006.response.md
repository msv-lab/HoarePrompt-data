Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged.
