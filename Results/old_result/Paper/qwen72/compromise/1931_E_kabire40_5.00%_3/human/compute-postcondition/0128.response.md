Postcondition: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, and `rev_res` is a string containing the elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same string length as their original string length, concatenated together. `rev_val` must have at least one element. Additionally, `x` is not divisible by 2.**
