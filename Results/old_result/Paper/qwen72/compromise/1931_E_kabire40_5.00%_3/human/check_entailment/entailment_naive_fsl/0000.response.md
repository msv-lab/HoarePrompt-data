Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to handle the game's turn-based nature and the optimal play strategy for both players. Here are the issues:

1. **Reversing Digits**: The program reverses all numbers in the list, but it does not simulate the turn-based nature of the game where Anna and Sasha take turns. The program should only reverse one number per Anna's turn.

2. **Concatenation Logic**: The program does not simulate the concatenation of two numbers by Sasha. Instead, it sorts and concatenates the reversed numbers in a specific order, which does not follow the game rules.

3. **Winning Condition**: The program checks the final concatenated number against \(10^m\) but does not correctly simulate the game to ensure that the final number is the result of optimal play.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will reverse both numbers, resulting in `41` and `2`. It will then concatenate them in a specific order, which may not be the optimal play. The program does not correctly simulate the game, so it may output `Anna` instead of `Sasha`.

The program needs to be rewritten to correctly simulate the game according to the rules and to ensure that both players play optimally.
