The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, the list `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `test_cases` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list**
