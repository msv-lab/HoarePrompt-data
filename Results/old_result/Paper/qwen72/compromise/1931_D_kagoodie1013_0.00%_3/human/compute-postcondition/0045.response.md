Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and the value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and the value 1, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the result of `num % y`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `mod_x`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` are still derived from `num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
- The `results` list, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` dictionaries are not directly affected by this code snippet.
