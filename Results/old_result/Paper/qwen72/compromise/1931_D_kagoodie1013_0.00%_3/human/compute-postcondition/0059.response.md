Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % x` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % y` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_y_key`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` variables remain as they were defined in the initial state.
- The `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
- The `count` variable is updated to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for each element `num` in `arr`.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys that are the results of `num % x` for each element in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each `mod_x_key` appeared.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys that are the results of `num % y` for each element in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each `mod_y_key` appeared.
