Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. Each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each a is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr` except the first occurrence of each unique `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % x` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % y` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_y_key`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
