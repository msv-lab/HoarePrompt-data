The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**
