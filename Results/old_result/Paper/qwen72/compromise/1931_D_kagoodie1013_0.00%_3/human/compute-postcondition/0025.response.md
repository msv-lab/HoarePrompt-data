Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is updated to `num % x`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to `num % x`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, which is the same as the initial value of `mod_y_key` since both `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` were initially set to `num % x`.
