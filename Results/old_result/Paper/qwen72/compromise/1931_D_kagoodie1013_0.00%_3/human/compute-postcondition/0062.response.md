Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % x` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the results of `num % y` for each element in `arr` and values representing the count of each unique `mod_y_key`.**
