Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. Each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each a is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
