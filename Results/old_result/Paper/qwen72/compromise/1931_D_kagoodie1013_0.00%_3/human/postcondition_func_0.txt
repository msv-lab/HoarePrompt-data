The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the sum of the counts of specific remainders for the numbers in `arr`. Specifically, for each number in `arr`, the function calculates the remainder when the number is divided by `x` and the remainder when the number is divided by `y`. It then adds to the count the number of times these remainders have been seen before in the current test case. The final state of the program is that `test_cases` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the computed counts for each test case.
