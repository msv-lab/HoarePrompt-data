Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 (or both), `x` and `y` retain their original values from the input.***
