Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
2. `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
3. `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
4. `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `bxsfory`**:
   - `bxsfory` is defined as the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
   - For example, if `y = 3`, then `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - If `y = 4`, then `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.

2. **Update `x`**:
   - The new value of `x` is calculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - Let's assume `x` has some initial value `x0`.
   - The updated value of `x` will be `x0 - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

3. **Determine `bxsfory1`**:
   - `bxsfory1` depends on the updated value of `x`.
   - If the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1 = 0`.
   - Otherwise, `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

4. **Calculate `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`**:
   - We need to determine the value of `bxsfory1` based on the updated `x` and then add it to `bxsfory`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some initial values to understand the process better:
- Suppose `x0 = 50` and `y = 3`.
- Then `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
- The updated value of `x` is `50 - 2 * 15 + 3 * 4 = 50 - 30 + 12 = 32`.

Now, we need to determine `bxsfory1`:
- Since `32 > 0`, `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(32 / 15) + 1 = math.ceil(2.1333) + 1 = 3`.

Finally, we calculate `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`:
- `bxsfory1 + bxsfory = 3 + 2 = 5`.

### General Case:
- `bxsfory` is always a positive integer because `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- The updated value of `x` depends on the initial value of `x` and the values of `y` and `bxsfory`.
- `bxsfory1` will be 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it will be `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, and bxsfory1 is 0 if the updated x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is math.ceil(x / 15) + 1)**
