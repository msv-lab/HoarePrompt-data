You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, and bxsfory1 is 0 if the updated x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is math.ceil(x / 15) + 1)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the ceiling of \(x / 15\), which is an integer between 1 and 7.
                #
                #Output:
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both, and the conditions remain unchanged.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is a positive integer greater than 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions also remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both, and the conditions remain unchanged.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 (or both), `x` and `y` retain their original values from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates with non-negative integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99, but the specific return value or behavior is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
