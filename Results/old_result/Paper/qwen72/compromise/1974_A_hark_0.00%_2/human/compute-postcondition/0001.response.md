The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it is inherently greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
