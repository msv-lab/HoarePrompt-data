The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it is implied that there might be an internal use of a non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since no specific output is provided, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely returns a value or performs an action based on the internal use of `t`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and likely returns a value or performs an action based on an internal non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
