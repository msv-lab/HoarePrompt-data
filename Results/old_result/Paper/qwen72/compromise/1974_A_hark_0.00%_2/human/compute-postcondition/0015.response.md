Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is a positive integer greater than 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions also remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both, and the conditions remain unchanged.***
