### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`. It is not directly involved in solving the problem but could be used for comparison purposes if needed.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for its intended purpose.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - Update `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - Print the total number of screens: `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print 0.
   - **Correctness**: The logic in `func_2` is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for both types of icons and handles all edge cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_2` `t` times to process each test case.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one by calling `func_2`, which is the function responsible for solving the problem for a single test case.

### Conclusion:
The program as a whole is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calculating the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
