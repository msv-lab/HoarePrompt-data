You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are values of any type that can be compared using the less than (<) operator.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it returns `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that can be compared using the less than (<) operator. It returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. The function does not modify the input parameters.

If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both, and the conditions remain unchanged.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is a positive integer greater than 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions also remain unchanged. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both, and the conditions remain unchanged.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 (or both), `x` and `y` retain their original values from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from user input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99. It then prints a value based on the following conditions: If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of the ceiling of `y / 2` and a calculated value based on the updated `x`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` from the user input where 1 <= t <= 10^4. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is less than the number of empty spaces left after placing all 2x2 icons (y * 4). This can lead to an incorrect number of screens being calculated. For example, if `x = 1` and `y = 2`, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed. The correct number of screens should be 2, but the program will output 3. 

The issue is in the line:
```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```
This line incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` before adding `y * 4`, which can result in a negative value for `x` and an incorrect calculation of `bxsfory1`. The correct approach should be to first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces, ensuring that the number of screens is minimized.
