### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values, `a` and `b`. It is not directly used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not critical to the overall solution. However, it is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - Adjust the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the space taken by the 2x2 icons: `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - Print the total number of screens: `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print 0.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens is correct. It correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_2` `t` times, which processes each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, ensuring that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` work together to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic but is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
