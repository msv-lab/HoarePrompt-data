The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of elements in the list `c`.
  - `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, which could be a parameter related to the operation on the list `c`.
  - `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns a result based on these inputs. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. Given the constraints, we can infer that the function processes the list `c` in some way for each test case, possibly involving the parameter `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list `c` of `n` integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `c`.**
