You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then calculates the frequency of each unique integer in `l` and checks if the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to `k`. If the condition is met, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the appropriate value (`k - 1` or `n`) has been printed to the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a hand of `n` cards, each with a number on it.
   - We can perform an operation where we choose `k` cards with the same number and exchange them for `k-1` cards with any number.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in the hand after performing any number of operations.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - The output for each test case is the minimum number of cards left in the hand.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers.
   - It counts the frequency of each unique number in the list of card numbers.
   - If the maximum frequency of any number is at least `k`, it prints `k-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to determine if we can perform any operations.
   - If the maximum frequency of any number is at least `k`, we can perform at least one operation. After performing the operation, we will always be left with `k-1` cards.
   - If the maximum frequency of any number is less than `k`, no operations can be performed, and the number of cards left will be `n`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether an operation can be performed based on the maximum frequency of any number.
   - If an operation can be performed, it correctly prints `k-1`.
   - If no operation can be performed, it correctly prints `n`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1 (no operations can be performed, so it prints `n`).
   - The program handles the case where all cards have the same number and `n` is a multiple of `k` (it prints `k-1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
