You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100. The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, the output is either k - 1 or n, depending on the condition max(p) >= k.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k` and then prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations or the fact that the number of cards left after operations can be less than `k - 1`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The program will output `2`, which is correct for this case. However, consider another input:
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
The program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because you can perform the following operations:
1. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 7 cards).
2. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 6 cards).
3. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 5 cards).
4. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 4 cards).
5. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 3 cards).
6. Exchange 3 cards numbered `1` for 2 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 2 cards).

Thus, the minimum number of cards left is `2`, not `3`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
