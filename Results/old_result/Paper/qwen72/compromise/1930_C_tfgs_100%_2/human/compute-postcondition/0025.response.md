Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `adv - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by subtracting `adv` from it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
