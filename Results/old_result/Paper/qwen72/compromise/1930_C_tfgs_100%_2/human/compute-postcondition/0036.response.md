Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains one more element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` must be greater than `j`**

The value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended to the list `ans`, making `ans` contain one more element. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the values of `i` and `adv` remain unchanged. The condition that `adv` must be greater than `j` still holds true.
