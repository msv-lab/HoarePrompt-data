Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; for each index `j` in the list `a`, `a[j]` is now `a[j] + (j + 1)`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0.**
