Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains one more element which is `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `adv` must be greater than `j + 3`**

Explanation:
- `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` adds the value `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `j` is already `j + 2` as per the initial state.
- The new element in `ans` is `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `a[i - 1] - j - 3`.
- The condition `adv` must be greater than `j + 1` is updated to `adv` must be greater than `j + 3` because `j` is now `j + 2`.
- The values of `i` and `adv` remain unchanged and still satisfy the conditions given in the initial state.
