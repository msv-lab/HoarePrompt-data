Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the frequency of all elements in `a` is now 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing `n` integers, where the first `len(a)` elements are the elements of `a` in the same order, and the remaining elements are integers that fill the gaps between the elements of `a` such that all integers from 1 to the maximum element in `a` are represented in `ans`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is updated with a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is now `cnt - 1`, `ans` has a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is now `cnt`, `ans` has a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
