Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is 0, `ans` has 0 elements appended, `j` is -1, `cnt` is decreased by 0.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains greater than 0.
- `adv` remains 0.
- `ans` has 0 elements appended, as `adv` is 0.
- `j` is `adv - 1`, which is -1.
- `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, which is 0, so `cnt` remains unchanged.
