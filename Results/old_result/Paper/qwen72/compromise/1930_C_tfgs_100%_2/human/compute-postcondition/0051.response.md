Output State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than `j + 1`, `ans` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `adv` remains greater than `j + 1`.
- The list `ans` has a new element appended, which is the result of the expression `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `j + 1`.
