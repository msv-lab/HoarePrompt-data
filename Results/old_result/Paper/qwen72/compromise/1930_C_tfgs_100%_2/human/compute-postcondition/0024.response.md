Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `adv - 1`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, with each integer within the range 1 to 10^9 and the list must have at least 2 elements.
- The variable `i` remains greater than 0.
- The `counter` object continues to count the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`.
- The variable `cur` remains 0.
- The variable `cnt` remains `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0.
- The list `ans` now contains `adv` elements, where each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`.
- The variable `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and it must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `j` is `adv - 1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
