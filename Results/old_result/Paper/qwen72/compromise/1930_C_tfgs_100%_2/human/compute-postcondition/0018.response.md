To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is the loop iterator and will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. **Variable `adv`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 1 element.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.

To ensure the loop executes, `adv` must be greater than 0. Let's break down the conditions for `adv`:

- `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` must be greater than 0.
- `cnt` must be greater than 0.
- `cur` must be greater than 0.

However, since `cur` is 0, the only way `adv` can be greater than 0 is if both `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` and `cnt` are greater than 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `a` must have at least 2 elements (since `i` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` must both exist).
- `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` must be greater than 0.
- `cnt` must be greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty list, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0.**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
