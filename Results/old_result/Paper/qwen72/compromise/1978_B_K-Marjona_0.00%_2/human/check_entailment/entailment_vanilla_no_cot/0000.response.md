Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum profit. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the profit from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price is incorrect. The formula \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k\) is meant to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series, but it is not correctly implemented.

The correct formula for the sum of the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price should be:

\[
\text{sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
\]

This formula correctly calculates the sum of the series \( b, (b-1), (b-2), \ldots, (b-k+1) \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            profit_from_first_k = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            profit_from_remaining = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_first_k + profit_from_remaining)
```

With this correction, the program should correctly calculate the maximum profit for each test case.
