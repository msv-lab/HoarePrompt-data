You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it updates the sliding window and the sum of matching elements (`sm`). Specifically, the conditions for updating `sm` are incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Update of `sm` when adding a new element:**
   ```python
   if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
       sm += 1
   ca[a[r]] += 1
   ```
   This condition incorrectly increments `sm` by 1 whenever the count of the new element in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`. However, `sm` should only be incremented if the new element is a match and was not already counted in the current window.

2. **Incorrect Update of `sm` when removing an element:**
   ```python
   if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
       sm -= 1
   ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
   ```
   This condition incorrectly decrements `sm` by 1 whenever the count of the element being removed from the window is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. However, `sm` should only be decremented if the element being removed was a match and was counted in the current window.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 2
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be `4` because the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all good. However, the given program will incorrectly count some subsegments.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add new element to the window
        new_elem = a[r]
        old_elem = a[r - m]
        if new_elem in cb:
            if ca[new_elem] < cb[new_elem]:
                sm += 1
            ca[new_elem] += 1
        # Remove old element from the window
        if old_elem in cb:
            ca[old_elem] -= 1
            if ca[old_elem] < cb[old_elem]:
                sm -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

This corrected program correctly updates the sliding window and the sum of matching elements, ensuring that the program works as expected for all potential cases.
