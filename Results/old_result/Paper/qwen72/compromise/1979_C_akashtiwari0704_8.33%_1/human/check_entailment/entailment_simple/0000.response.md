Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the product of all the multipliers (`prod`) and then distributing the bets as `prod // a[i]` for each outcome. This approach ensures that the return for each winning outcome is `prod`, which is the same for all outcomes. However, the key requirement is that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The logic in the program calculates the sum of all bets (`sumo`) and checks if it is less than `prod`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to meet the requirement. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

However, there is a fundamental issue with this approach. The product of all multipliers (`prod`) can become extremely large, especially when `n` is close to 50 and the multipliers are at their maximum value (20). This can lead to overflow issues and make the bets impractically large, even though they might theoretically satisfy the condition.

Moreover, the condition `if sumo >= prod:` is not the correct check. The correct condition should be that the total bet `sumo` must be strictly less than the return for each outcome, which is `prod // a[i] * a[i]` (which simplifies to `prod`). Therefore, the condition should be `if sumo >= prod // min(a):`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`). In such cases, the product of all multipliers will be very large, and the sum of the bets will also be large, making it impossible to satisfy the condition.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
