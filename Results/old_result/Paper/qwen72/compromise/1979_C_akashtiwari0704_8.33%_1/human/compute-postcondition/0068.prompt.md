Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `ans` is an empty string, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `ans` is now a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `ans` is now a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space, and the second element of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is `T + 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is now a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is the product of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the elements `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `ans` is now a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space, the second element of `a` followed by a space, and the third element of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
