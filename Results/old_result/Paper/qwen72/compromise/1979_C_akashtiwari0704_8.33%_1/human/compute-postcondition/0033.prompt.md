Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is an empty string, `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` remain integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` remains 0, `bets` remains an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input but now each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]` (where `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`), `prod` remains the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]` (where `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`), `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the string representation of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of `a[i - 1]` followed by a space, followed by the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` for 0 ≤ i < bets is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the original `a`, `i` is `bets`, and `sumo` is the sum of the new values of `a[0]` through `a[bets - 1]` and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
