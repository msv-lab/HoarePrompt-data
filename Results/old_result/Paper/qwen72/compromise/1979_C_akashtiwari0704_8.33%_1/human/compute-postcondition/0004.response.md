Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers read from the user's input, `prod` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n`, `T`, `bets`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
