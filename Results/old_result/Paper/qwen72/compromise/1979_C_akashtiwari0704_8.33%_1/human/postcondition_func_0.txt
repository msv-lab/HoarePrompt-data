The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of outcomes and their respective multipliers. For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers and then updates each multiplier to the product divided by the original multiplier. It sums these updated multipliers and checks if the sum is less than the product. If so, it prints the updated multipliers as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving the input variables `t` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` unchanged, but the internal variables used in the function (like `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans`) are no longer accessible.
