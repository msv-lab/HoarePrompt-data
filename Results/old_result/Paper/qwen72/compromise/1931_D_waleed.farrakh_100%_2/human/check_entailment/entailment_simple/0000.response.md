### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - The state of `test_cases` is correctly described as a list of tuples, each containing the required values.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq` and increments the count if it is.
   - It then updates `freq` with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - The final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - The state of `results` is correctly described as a list containing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases, `func_2` calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and gets the `results` list.
   - It then prints each result, which is the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for determining beautiful pairs is correct. The use of `freq` to count pairs that satisfy the conditions is appropriate.
- The output is correctly generated and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
