Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is a dictionary that may contain the key `(rx, ry)`, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, and the key `(rx, ry)` is present in `freq`.**
