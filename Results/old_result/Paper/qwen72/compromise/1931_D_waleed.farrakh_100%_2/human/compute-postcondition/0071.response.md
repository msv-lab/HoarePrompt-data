The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have appeared more than once in `arr` as the loop iterates through each element. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, and the value of each key is the number of times the corresponding pair `(a % x, a % y)` appears in `arr`. `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have appeared more than once in `arr` as the loop iterates through each element. `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.**
