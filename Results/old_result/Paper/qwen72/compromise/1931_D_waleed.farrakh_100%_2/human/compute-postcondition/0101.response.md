Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the third element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1 if `current_pair` was not originally in `freq`, and with the value 2 if `current_pair` was originally in `freq`. `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the value of `current_pair` to be the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `a`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, but `current_pair` is now explicitly defined as `(a % x, a % y)`.
- The values of `rx` and `ry` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The value of `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, or it remains 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`.
- The list `results` still contains the value 0.
