Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1), `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is 0, and `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `freq[current_pair] += 1` increments the value of the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` by 1.
- Initially, `freq` contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1.
- After the execution, `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
