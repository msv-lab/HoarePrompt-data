Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, and the value of each key is the number of times the corresponding pair `(a % x, a % y)` appears in `arr`. `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have appeared more than once in `arr` as the loop iterates through each element.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- The tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases` is still the second tuple, and `arr` has `n` elements.
- The dictionary `freq` contains keys that are pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that pair appears in `arr`.
- The variable `count` keeps track of the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered more than once as the loop iterates through `arr`.
