Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `a` is the third element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `current_pair` with the value 2, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `freq[current_pair] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` by 1.
- Initially, `freq` includes the key `current_pair` with the value 1.
- After executing the code, the value of `freq[current_pair]` becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
