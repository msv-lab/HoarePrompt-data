Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases`), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `count`, which has been initialized to 0.
