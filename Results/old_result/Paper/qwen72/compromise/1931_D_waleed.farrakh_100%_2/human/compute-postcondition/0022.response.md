To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the `results` object, as it is the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted. The loop will execute if `results` is an iterable with at least one element. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`results` must be an iterable**: This is already implied by the state before the loop, as `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, and we assume `func_1` returns an iterable.
2. **`results` must have at least one element**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples.
- `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

We need to ensure that `results` has at least one element. The state of `data`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `idx` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`results` must be an iterable with at least one element**.
