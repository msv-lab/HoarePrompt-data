Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the corresponding parts of the strings at `data[1], data[3], ...`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from the strings at `data[2], data[4], ...`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`. `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.**
