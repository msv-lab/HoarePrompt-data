Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, and `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been found in `freq` before it was updated in the current iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` for each element `a` in `arr`, and the value of each key is the number of times the corresponding pair `(a % x, a % y)` appears in `arr`. `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have appeared more than once in `arr` as the loop iterates through each element. `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` remains a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0). The variable `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`. The variable `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` was found in `freq` before the current element `a` was processed. The variable `results` is a list containing the values 0 and `count`, and `a` is the last element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
