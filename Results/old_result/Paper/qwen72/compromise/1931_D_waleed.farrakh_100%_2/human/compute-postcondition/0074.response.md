Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `count` to 0.
- The initial state specified that `results` is a list containing the value of `count`. Since `count` is now 0, `results` will contain 0.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `freq`) remain unchanged.
