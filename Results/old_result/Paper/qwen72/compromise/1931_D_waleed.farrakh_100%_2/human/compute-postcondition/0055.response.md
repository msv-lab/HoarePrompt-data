Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the second tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1), `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is equal to `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is equal to `a % y`, `current_pair` is equal to `(a % x, a % y)`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1` and `freq[rx, ry]` is updated to `freq[rx, ry] + 1`. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and `freq` now contains the key `current_pair` with the value 1.***
