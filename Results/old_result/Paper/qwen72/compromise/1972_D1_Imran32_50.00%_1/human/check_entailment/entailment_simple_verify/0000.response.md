### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\), but the variable name is incorrect).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates `root` as \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1\).
   - It iterates from 2 to `root` and updates `ans` using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - The state of the program before the function call is correct: it should take two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) as inputs.
   - Inside `func_1`, the variable `k` is used instead of `m`, which is a mistake.
   - The program calculates `root` as \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1\).
   - The loop from 2 to `root` updates `ans` using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which does not correspond to the problem's requirement.
   - The final state of `ans` is \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Original Assessment Validation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the second condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program's logic is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - The example provided in the original assessment is accurate. For the input:
     ```
     1
     2 3
     ```
     The expected output is 3, but the program will output a different value because it is not correctly implementing the logic to check the condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
