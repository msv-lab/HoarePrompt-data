You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates a value `ans` by adding `n` to the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each integer `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The function prints the final value of `ans` and does not return any value. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly solving the problem as described.
   - The variable `k` is read but not used in the function, which suggests a mismatch in the function's parameters.
   - The logic inside the function does not match the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - This requires a more complex algorithm, possibly involving iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` is not implementing the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
