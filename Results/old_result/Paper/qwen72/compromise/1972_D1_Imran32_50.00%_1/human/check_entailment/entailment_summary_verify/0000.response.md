### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, but it does not use `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem description) in any of its calculations.
   - The function calculates `ans` by adding `n` to the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each integer `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Missing Condition Check:**
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided program does not perform this check at all. Instead, it performs a series of unrelated arithmetic operations.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     2 3
     ```
     The expected output is 3, as the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program will output a different value because it is not correctly implementing the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, but it does not align with the problem requirements. The function is performing a different set of calculations and does not address the problem's conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` performs unrelated calculations and does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
