### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the input. However, the problem description specifies that the second integer should be \(m\), not \(k\). This is a discrepancy.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive), and for each \(i\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The variable `k` is used instead of `m`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
   - The loop and the update to `ans` are not aligned with the problem's constraints and conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The variable names and the logic inside the function do not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
