Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the transition from 12-hour format AM to PM correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets the time to AM for the hour '12' (which should be PM), and it does not handle the hour '00' correctly (which should be '12 AM' but is set to '12 PM' in the program). Additionally, the program does not handle the transition from '12 PM' to '01 PM' correctly. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = h
        time = ''
        if int(h) < 12:
            time = 'AM'
            if h == '00':
                h1 = '12'
        else:
            time = 'PM'
            if h != '12':
                h1 = str(int(h) - 12)
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the transition between AM and PM and ensures that '00' is converted to '12 AM' and '12' remains '12 PM'.
