To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while numbers != []:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is the state of `numbers`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `numCases` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order
- `suma` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time, `numbers` must not be an empty list. Since the problem statement mentions that `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, it implies that `numbers` should contain at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time, as `numbers` being a sorted list of strings already ensures that it is not empty.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order, `suma` is 0**
