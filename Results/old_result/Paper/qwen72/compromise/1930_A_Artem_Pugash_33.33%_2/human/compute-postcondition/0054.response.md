Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values split by spaces in ascending order and must contain at least one element (but now has five less elements), `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the third element that was removed from `numbers`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to `a`.
- Since `a` was already defined as the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, this operation updates the list `numbers` to have one more element removed.
- The initial state mentioned that `numbers` had four less elements, so after this operation, `numbers` now has five less elements.
- All other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`, `b`) remain unchanged.
