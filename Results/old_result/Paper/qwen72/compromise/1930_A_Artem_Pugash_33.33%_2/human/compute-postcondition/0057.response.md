Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numCases`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numInteger`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`numbers`**: Initially a sorted list of strings representing the input values, but after the loop completes, it becomes an empty list because all elements are removed during the loop execution.
- **`suma`**: Initially 0, it accumulates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` during each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `suma` contains the total sum of these minimum values.
