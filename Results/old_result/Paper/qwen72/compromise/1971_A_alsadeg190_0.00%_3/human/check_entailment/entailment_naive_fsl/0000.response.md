Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. Specifically, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
