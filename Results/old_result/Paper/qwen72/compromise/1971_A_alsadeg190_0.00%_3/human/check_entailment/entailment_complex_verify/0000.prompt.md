You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the last input values received during the loop execution. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9). For each test case, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The number of test cases is determined by the initial input `x`, which must be a positive integer (1 <= x <= 100). After processing all test cases, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last input values received during the loop execution, and the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. Specifically, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. For example, if the input is `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`.
