### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user input.
   - **Processing:**
     - It initializes a list `S` to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
     - For each character in the string `a`, it updates the cumulative counts and appends them to `S`.
     - It then iterates through possible positions to place the road (from 0 to `n-1`).
     - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
     - It checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met on both sides:
       - At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
       - At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.
     - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village.
   - **Output:** The function prints the index `ans` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Processing:**
     - It iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it calls `func_1` to process one test case.
   - **Output:** The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of each test case through the calls to `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- **Cumulative Counts (`S`):** The list `S` is correctly constructed to store the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`. This is essential for efficiently calculating the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of the road for any position.
- **Condition Checking:** The conditions for satisfaction are correctly implemented. The function checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side.
- **Optimal Position:** The function correctly finds the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village. It uses the `abs(n / 2 - i)` to determine the closest position to the middle.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem description. It processes each test case independently and prints the correct answer for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
