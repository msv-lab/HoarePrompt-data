The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function `func_2` does not take any parameters, there are no other variables to consider. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
