Precondition: **The function should take a single parameter, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= len(s) <= 500. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the function to be useful based on the problem description, it should accept at least the binary string `s` as a parameter, and possibly the number of test cases `t` if the function is designed to handle multiple test cases in a single call. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(s, t=1):
```

Precondition: **s is a string of length 1 to 500, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.**
