To determine what will be printed by the `print(count + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `q` is 1.
   - `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 2`.
   - `flag` is 0.
   - `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of the current character is not equal to the integer value of the next character.

2. **Understanding `count`:**
   - `count` is calculated by iterating through the string `s` and counting the positions where the integer value of the current character (ASCII value) is not equal to the integer value of the next character.
   - For example, if `s = "abc"`, the integer values are `ord('a') = 97`, `ord('b') = 98`, and `ord('c') = 99`. The differences are `97 != 98` and `98 != 99`, so `count` would be 2.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(count + 1)` will print the value of `count` plus 1.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of the current character is not equal to the integer value of the next character, adding 1 to `count` will give us `count + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **count + 1 (where count is the number of positions where the integer value of the current character is not equal to the integer value of the next character in the string `s`)**
