Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= len(s) <= 500.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the integer values of the characters are not equal, and `i` is `len(s) - 2`. If `flag` is 0, it indicates there are no pairs of adjacent characters in `s` where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character. If `flag` is 1, it indicates there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the integer value of the first character is less than the integer value of the second character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 1, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of the current character is not equal to the integer value of the next character. If `flag` is 0, the program retains the initial state of the variables. If `flag` is 1, the program retains the initial state of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `q` is 2, `s` is a new input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count` is the number of positions in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is not equal to the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`. If `flag` is 0, indicating that there is no position in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, then no changes are made. If `flag` is 1, indicating that there is at least one position in the string `s` where the integer value of the character at position `i` is less than the integer value of the character at position `i + 1`, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
