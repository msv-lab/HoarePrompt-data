Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `edges`, but the values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start` remain unchanged.
