nodes is a list of lists representing a tree with n nodes, where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each node is connected by edges represented as pairs of integers (u, v) with 1 <= u, v <= n. start is an integer representing the starting node, where 1 <= start <= n. parent is an integer representing the parent node of the current node in the tree, or None if the current node has no parent.
