    #State: nodes is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n nodes, start is an integer representing the starting node (1 ≤ start ≤ n), and parent is an integer representing the parent node of the starting node or None if the starting node has no parent. The length of nodes[start] is not 1, or if it is 1, then nodes[start][0] is not equal to parent.

    return distances
    #The program returns the list `distances` which contains the distances from the starting node to all its child nodes (excluding the parent node) after one level of recursion through `func_1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `nodes` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree), `start` (an integer representing the starting node, where 1 ≤ start ≤ n), and `parent` (an integer representing the parent node of the starting node or None if the starting node has no parent). It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all its child nodes (excluding the parent node). If the starting node has no child nodes (excluding the parent node), the function returns a list containing a single element, which is 0. Otherwise, it returns a list of distances, where each distance is the number of edges from the starting node to each of its child nodes, after one level of recursion. The `nodes` list, `start` integer, and `parent` integer remain unchanged after the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer and always equals 1, nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.

    #State: `n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list` containing the adjacency lists of the nodes based on the input edges, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.

    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :

    #State: *`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list` containing the adjacency lists of the nodes based on the input edges, `start` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the `nodes` dictionary, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If any move in `moves` is an odd number, the program takes a specific action (not detailed). Otherwise, if all moves in `moves` are even, the program takes a different specific action (not detailed).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from the user, then reads `n-1` pairs of integers to construct an undirected graph represented by a dictionary `nodes`. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads a starting node `start` from the user and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The result of `func_1` is a list `moves`. If any element in `moves` is odd, the function prints 'Ron'. If all elements in `moves` are even, the function prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
