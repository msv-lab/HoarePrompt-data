You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters a, b, and m, where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the duration for which each firework is visible. All parameters are integers within the range 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained between iterations, and `t` remains unchanged. For each iteration, the loop reads new values for `a`, `b`, and `m` from input and prints the result of the computation based on these values. After `t` iterations, the loop finishes, and `t` is still the same as in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`, all integers within the range 1 to 10^18. It returns the total number of distinct moments within the first `m` seconds when at least one firework is visible from either installation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
