Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
2. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the first move, and the game will end with Bob being unable to make a move.
3. If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move, leaving Alice with no coins to choose from.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the result for each case. The logic in `func_1` is based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins, which is a valid and optimal strategy for determining the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
