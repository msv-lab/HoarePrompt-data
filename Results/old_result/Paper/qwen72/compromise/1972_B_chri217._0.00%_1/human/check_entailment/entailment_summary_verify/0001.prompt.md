You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only the characters "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' if the number of "U" characters is even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circle of `n` coins, each of which can be either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because there are no facing-up coins left) loses the game.
   - The goal is to determine who will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her move.
   - If there are an even number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always leave an even number of facing-up coins after her move, and Bob can then ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after his move.
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win because she can always leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, and Bob will eventually be forced to leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always win because he can always leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, and Alice will eventually be forced to leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, it returns "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, it returns "NO" (Bob wins).

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting `n` and `s` from the list `data`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. The reasoning is sound and the implementation matches the optimal strategy described.

Correctness: **True**
