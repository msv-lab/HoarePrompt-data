### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: It converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit from 0 to 29 (since \( x < 2^{30} \)). This is done by checking if the bit at position `i` is set in `x` using the bitwise AND operation (`x & pow(2, i)`).

3. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Bits**: The function then processes the binary string to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present. It uses a flag to track whether a carry-over needs to be applied. If a '1' is followed by another '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating a carry-over. The flag is used to adjust subsequent bits accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**: After processing the entire string, the function checks if there is a remaining carry-over (flag is set) and adjusts the last bit or appends an additional bit if necessary.

5. **Output**: The function prints the length of the resulting array and the array itself.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Binary Conversion**: The binary conversion is correct and ensures that the array `s` contains '1' for each set bit in `x` and '0' otherwise.
- **Consecutive Non-Zero Bits Handling**: The logic for handling consecutive non-zero bits is correct. It ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present by converting the first '1' to '-1' and setting a carry-over flag.
- **Carry-Over Handling**: The carry-over logic is correctly implemented, ensuring that the final array meets the requirement of no two consecutive non-zero bits.
- **Output Length**: The length of the array is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It generates a valid array for the given integer `x` and ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits are present.

### Correctness:
**True**
