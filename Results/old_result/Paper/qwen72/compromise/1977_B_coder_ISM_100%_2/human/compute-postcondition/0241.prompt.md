Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After the loop has executed all 29 iterations, `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 28, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The exact values in `s` depend on the initial bits of `x` and the interactions between adjacent elements during the loop's execution. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 29th element of `s` (`s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, and `s` is a list containing 31 elements where the last element is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30 and the last element of `s` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1' and `s[1]` is '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged. `flag` is either 1 or 0, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag` and the last element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1' and `s[1]` is '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except that `s[2]` is now '0'. `s[i - 1]` (which is `s[1]`) is now '-1'. `flag` is either 1 or 0, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag` and the last element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[1]` is now '-1' and `s[2]` is '0'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged except that `s[2]` is now '0'. `s[1]` (which is `s[i - 1]`) is now '-1'. `flag` is either 1 or 0, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag` and the last element of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
