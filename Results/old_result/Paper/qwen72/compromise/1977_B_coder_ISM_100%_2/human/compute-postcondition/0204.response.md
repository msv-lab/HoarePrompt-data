Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, and `s[1]` is now '0'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[1]` was '0', then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
