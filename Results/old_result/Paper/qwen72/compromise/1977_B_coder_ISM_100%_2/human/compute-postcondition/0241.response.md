Output State: **`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The list `s` will have been processed such that any occurrence of `-1` followed by `1` will result in the `-1` moving one position to the left and the `1` becoming `0`. This process will continue through the entire list up to the 29th index. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 29th element of `s` (`s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, and `s` is a list containing 31 elements where the last element is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30 and the last element of `s` is not '0'.**
