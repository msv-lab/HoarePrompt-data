Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), with any consecutive '1's replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is 30, `s` has 30 elements, and `flag` is 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s` has 31 elements, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'. The value of `s[2]` is now '0'.**
