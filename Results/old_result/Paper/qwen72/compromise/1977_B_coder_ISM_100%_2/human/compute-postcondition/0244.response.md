Output State: **`x` remains an input integer, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `nalla` is `t-1`, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. The list `s` will have been processed such that any occurrence of `-1` followed by `1` will result in the `-1` moving one position to the left and the `1` becoming `0`. This process will continue through the entire list up to the 29th index. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 29th element of `s` (`s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is 31, and `s` is a list containing 31 elements where the last element is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `length` remains 30 and the last element of `s` is not '0'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `x` will still be an input integer, but its value will be the last input provided during the loop.
- The variable `t` will retain its initial value, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `nalla` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `length` will be either 30 or 31, depending on the final state of the list `s`.
- The variable `i` will be 29, as it is the last index processed in the inner loop.
- The list `s` will contain 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1', reflecting the transformations applied during the loop. Specifically, any consecutive '1's will have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 will have been flipped to '1'. The final state of `s` will also reflect the adjustments made to the 29th element based on the value of `flag`.
