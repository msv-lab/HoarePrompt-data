Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit) is set (1) or not set (0). If `flag` is 1, then `s[0]` is '0' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is not 1, then `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
