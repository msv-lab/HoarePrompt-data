The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `30`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if the range specified (30) is greater than 0, which it is. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the range itself. However, for the loop to start executing, `i` should be 0 initially.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `i` is 0**
