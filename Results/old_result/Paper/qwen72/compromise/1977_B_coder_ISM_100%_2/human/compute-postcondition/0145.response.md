Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 29, and `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements representing the binary form of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). Any consecutive '1's have been replaced with '-1' followed by '1', and any '0's encountered while `flag` is 1 have been flipped to '1'. The final state of `s` reflects these changes. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` has 31 elements, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` has 30 elements, and either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
