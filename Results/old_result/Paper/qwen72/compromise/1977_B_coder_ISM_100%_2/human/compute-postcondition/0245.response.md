The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraint, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30. Since no specific output is provided, it's not clear what the function returns. To accurately describe the functionality, we need more information about the output.

Given the lack of explicit output details, I'll assume the function returns the value of `x`:

Functionality: **The function generates and returns a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30.**
