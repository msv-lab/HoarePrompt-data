Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not correctly account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks launched by the two installations.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the visibility intervals of the fireworks and determine the maximum overlap. Specifically, you should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the points where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously, and then determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m // a + 1) + (m // b + 1) - (m // l + 1)
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Explanation:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b` using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
3. **Fireworks Calculation**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is calculated by:
   - Adding the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility time `m` (`m // a + 1`).
   - Adding the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility time `m` (`m // b + 1`).
   - Subtracting the number of fireworks launched by both installations at the same time within the visibility time `m` (`m // l + 1`).

This approach ensures that the overlap in visibility times is correctly accounted for, leading to the correct maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
