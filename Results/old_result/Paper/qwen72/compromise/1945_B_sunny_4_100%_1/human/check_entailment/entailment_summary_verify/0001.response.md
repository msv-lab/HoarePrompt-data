### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - We need to consider the overlap of visibility periods for fireworks launched by both installations.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - For the first installation, the fireworks are launched at times `0, a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
   - For the second installation, the fireworks are launched at times `0, b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
   - We need to find the maximum number of these times that fall within any `m + 1` minute interval.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible at any time within `m + 1` minutes is the sum of these two values plus any additional overlap that might occur.

5. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The overlap occurs when a firework from the first installation and a firework from the second installation are launched within `m + 1` minutes of each other.
   - The maximum overlap is 1, because if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x`, and a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y` where `|x - y| <= m`, they will overlap for at least one minute.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

7. **Code Review:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m + 1` minutes and adds 2 to account for the maximum possible overlap.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a` and `b` are both 1, the installations launch fireworks every minute, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m + 2`.
   - When `a` or `b` is very large compared to `m`, the number of fireworks launched by that installation within `m + 1` minutes is 1, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `1 + m // b + 1` or `m // a + 1 + 1`.

### Evaluation:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`.
  - It then calculates the value `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints this value.
  - After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed `t` lines, each containing the calculated value for the corresponding test case.
  - The function does not return any value.

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time.
  - This formula is derived from the observation that the maximum overlap is 1 minute, and each installation can launch `m // a + 1` and `m // b + 1` fireworks within `m + 1` minutes, respectively.
  - Adding 2 accounts for the maximum possible overlap of 1 minute and the initial launch at time 0.

- **Input and Output Handling:**
  - The code correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
  - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - It prints the result for each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases correctly:
    - When `a` and `b` are both 1, the result is `m + 2`.
    - When `a` or `b` is very large compared to `m`, the result is `1 + m // b + 1` or `m // a + 1 + 1`.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the given problem description. The logic and the formula used are correct, and the code handles the input and output as specified.
