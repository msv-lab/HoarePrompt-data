The only variables in the loop head are `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `qi` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `qi` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `qi` is 0**
