The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts does not ensure that `a` is greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
