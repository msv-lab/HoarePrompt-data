Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is the previous value of `nx` with 'S' appended if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'F' appended otherwise.**
