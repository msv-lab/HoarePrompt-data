Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `j` is 3. If `x[2]` is 'F', `a[3]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged. If `x[2]` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[3]` are both increased by 1, and the state of `a[1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the states of `a[1]`, `a[3]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged.***
