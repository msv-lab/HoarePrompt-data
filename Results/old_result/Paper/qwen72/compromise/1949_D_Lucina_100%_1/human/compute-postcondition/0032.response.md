The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be within the range 2 <= n <= 24.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `x` is the input provided by the user, `xx` is a list that now includes `x`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
