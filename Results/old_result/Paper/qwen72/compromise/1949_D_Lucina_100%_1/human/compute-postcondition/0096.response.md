The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24
- `i` is 1
- `xx` contains `n` strings, each string being one of the `n` lines of input
- `a` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines
- `b` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines
- `sa` is a list containing the value 1 if `a[1] > 0` and `b[1] == 0`, otherwise `sa` is an empty list
- `sb` is an empty list
- `b[1] > 0` and `a[1] == 0`

After executing `sb.append(i)`, the value of `i` (which is 1) is appended to the list `sb`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n` strings, each string being one of the `n` lines of input, `a` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `b` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value 1, `b[1] > 0` and `a[1] == 0`.**
