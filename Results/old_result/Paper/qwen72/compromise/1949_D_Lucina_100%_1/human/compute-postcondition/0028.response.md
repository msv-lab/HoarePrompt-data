Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 3. If `x[1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are both increased by 1, and the values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.***
