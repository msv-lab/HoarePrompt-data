Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and `j` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.**
