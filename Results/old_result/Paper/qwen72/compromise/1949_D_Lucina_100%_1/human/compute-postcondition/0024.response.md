Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 3, `a[1]` is increased by 1, and the values of `a[2]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[1]` by 1, as `i` is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
