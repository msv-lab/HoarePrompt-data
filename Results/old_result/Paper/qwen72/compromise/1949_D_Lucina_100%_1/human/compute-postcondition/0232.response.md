Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus the character at `xx[1][2]`. If `xx[1][2]` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.**
