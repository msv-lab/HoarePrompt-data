The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 1. However, since `n` is already defined to be within the range 2 to 24, the loop will always execute at least once. The initial state of `i` is 1, which is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1**
