Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2, `nx` is a string that has been appended with 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `sb` remains the same, containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `nx` is a string that has been appended with 'F'. The previous value of `nx` is not specified, but it is now a string that includes 'F' at the end.
