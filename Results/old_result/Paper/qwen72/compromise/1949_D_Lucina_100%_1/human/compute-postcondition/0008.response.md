Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 1, and the character at the 0th index of `x` is 'F'. `a[1]` is increased by 1.** 

The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` (which is 1) of the list `a` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
