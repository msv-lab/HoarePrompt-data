Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2, `nx` is now the string containing the character at index `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` (which is 1) followed by 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'SS'. Otherwise, if `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?', `nx` is 'FS'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?', `nx` is the original character at `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'S'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `sb` remains the same, containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to it.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?', `nx` is now the original character at `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'S'.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'SS'.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'FS'.
