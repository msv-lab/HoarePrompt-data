The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', and the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1.**
