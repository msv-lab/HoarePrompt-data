Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 1. If `xx[2][0]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at index 0 of `xx[2]`. If `xx[2][0]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.***
