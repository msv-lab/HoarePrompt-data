Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(nx)` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `i` is 3.
- `sb` is a list containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
- `j` is \(n + 1\).
- `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the following rules:
  - If `xx[3][k]` is not equal to '?', the character at position `k` in `nx` is `xx[3][k]`.
  - If `xx[3][k]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'S'.
  - Otherwise, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'F'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `nx`**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.

2. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the value of `j`**:
   - `j` is \(n + 1\).

4. **Determine the value of `sb`**:
   - `sb` is a list of indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0. The exact elements of `a` and `b` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact indices in `sb`. However, we know that `sb` contains indices from 1 to `n`.

5. **Determine the value of `n // 4 - 1`**:
   - This is the number of elements in the first quarter of `sb` minus 1. Since \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), the value of `n // 4 - 1` will be between 0 and 5.

6. **Determine the value of `xx[3]`**:
   - `xx[3]` is a string of length `n` where each character is either a specific character or '?'.

7. **Construct `nx` based on the rules**:
   - For each position `k` in `nx` (where \(0 \leq k < n\)):
     - If `xx[3][k]` is not '?', then `nx[k]` is `xx[3][k]`.
     - If `xx[3][k]` is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 3) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
       - Check if `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
       - If either condition is true, `nx[k]` is 'S'.
       - Otherwise, `nx[k]` is 'F'.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 12` for a concrete example:
- `n // 4 - 1` is \(12 // 4 - 1 = 2\).
- `sb` contains indices from 1 to 12 where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0. Let's assume `sb` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` for simplicity.
- The first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` are `[1, 2]`.

Now, let's assume `xx[3]` is a string of length 12 with some '?' characters:
- `xx[3] = "A?C?E?G?I?K?M?"`.

We will construct `nx` based on the rules:
- `k = 0`: `xx[3][0]` is 'A' (not '?'), so `nx[0]` is 'A'.
- `k = 1`: `xx[3][1]` is '?', and `k + 1` (2) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[1]` is 'S'.
- `k = 2`: `xx[3][2]` is 'C' (not '?'), so `nx[2]` is 'C'.
- `k = 3`: `xx[3][3]` is '?', and `i` (3) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[3]` is 'S'.
- `k = 4`: `xx[3][4]` is 'E' (not '?'), so `nx[4]` is 'E'.
- `k = 5`: `xx[3][5]` is '?', and neither `i` (3) nor `k + 1` (6) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[5]` is 'F'.
- `k = 6`: `xx[3][6]` is 'G' (not '?'), so `nx[6]` is 'G'.
- `k = 7`: `xx[3][7]` is '?', and neither `i` (3) nor `k + 1` (8) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[7]` is 'F'.
- `k = 8`: `xx[3][8]` is 'I' (not '?'), so `nx[8]` is 'I'.
- `k = 9`: `xx[3][9]` is '?', and neither `i` (3) nor `k + 1` (10) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[9]` is 'F'.
- `k = 10`: `xx[3][10]` is 'K' (not '?'), so `nx[10]` is 'K'.
- `k = 11`: `xx[3][11]` is '?', and neither `i` (3) nor `k + 1` (12) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, so `nx[11]` is 'F'.

Thus, `nx` will be `"A S C S E F G F I F K F"`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `xx[3]` and `sb` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form:
- `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the rules provided.
- If `xx[3][k]` is not '?', the character at position `k` in `nx` is `xx[3][k]`.
- If `xx[3][k]` is '?', and either `i` (which is 3) or `k + 1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'S'.
- Otherwise, the character at position `k` in `nx` is 'F'.

Output: **nx (where each character in nx is determined by the rules: if xx[3][k] is not '?', the character is xx[3][k]; if xx[3][k] is '?', and either i (3) or k + 1 is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, the character is 'S'; otherwise, the character is 'F')**
