You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` have been updated or re-assigned within each iteration. The final values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be the values from the last iteration. The `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` variables will be in their final state from the last iteration, but they are not part of the initial state and are recalculated in each iteration. The loop will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions described in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` and the list `a` of cube values.

2. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube using `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`. This is correct as per the problem description.

4. **Counting Removed Cubes**:
   - The program iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted list to count how many of them have the value of the favorite cube. This is done using the variable `removed_count`.

5. **Counting Total Favorite Cubes**:
   - The program counts the total number of cubes with the favorite value using `sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`. This is stored in `favorite_count`.

6. **Determining the Output**:
   - If all cubes with the favorite value are removed (`removed_count == favorite_count`), the program outputs "YES".
   - If none of the cubes with the favorite value are removed (`removed_count == 0`), the program outputs "NO".
   - If some, but not all, cubes with the favorite value are removed, the program outputs "MAYBE".

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Single Cube**: If `n == 1`, the favorite cube is the only cube, and it will always be removed if `k == 1`. The program handles this correctly.
- **Multiple Cubes with the Same Value**: If there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, the program correctly determines whether all, none, or some of them are removed.
