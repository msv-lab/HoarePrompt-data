The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each expected to be a string of digits from 1 to 9 of the same length. The function ensures that the first differing digit between the two strings, if `a` is initially less than `b`, is swapped. After processing, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` on separate lines, followed by a blank line. The function does not modify any external variables or handle multiple test cases as described in the comments.
