Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first differing character between `a` and `b` has been swapped if `a` was initially less than `b`. The flag `f` is set to 1 if any swap occurred or if `a` was greater than `b` at any point. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `a` are printed in the same order as they are in the list after any potential swaps that occurred based on the initial state. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the flag `f` retains its value from the initial state.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The characters in list `b` are printed in the same order as they are in the list. The variables `x`, `y`, `t`, and the flag `f` remain unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
