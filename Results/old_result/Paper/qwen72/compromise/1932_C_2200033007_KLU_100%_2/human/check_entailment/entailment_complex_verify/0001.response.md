### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - The annotations confirm that after processing all commands, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they were removed, and the pointers `l` and `r` are correctly updated.

4. **Product Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and takes the modulus `m`.
   - It appends the result to `ans`.
   - The annotations confirm that `p` is correctly updated to be the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case.
   - The annotations confirm that the final state of `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Command Execution:**
  - The program correctly processes the commands 'L' and 'R' by removing the appropriate elements from the array `a` and storing them in `b`.
  - The use of pointers `l` and `r` ensures that elements are removed from the correct end of the array.

- **Correctness of Product Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` at each step and takes the modulus `m`.
  - By iterating through `b` in reverse order, the program ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, matching the order of the commands.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as a single element array and a large number of test cases.
  - The constraints are respected, and the program should work efficiently within the given limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required remainders. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
