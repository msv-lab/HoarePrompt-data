Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for processing the commands as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the beginning of each command execution. Instead, it appends the elements to be removed to a list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order, which does not match the problem's requirements.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3 4 4 2
```

The expected output is the remainder of the product of the array elements at the beginning of each command execution, but the actual output is the elements that are being removed in the order they are processed. This discrepancy indicates that the program is not following the problem description correctly.
