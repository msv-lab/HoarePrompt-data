The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, but it will be set to 0 on the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
