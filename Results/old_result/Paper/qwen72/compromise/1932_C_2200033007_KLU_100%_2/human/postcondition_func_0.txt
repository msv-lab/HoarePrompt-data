The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'). It returns a list `ans` of `n` integers, where each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`. The list `b` is a rearrangement of the elements in `a` based on the characters in `s`: if the character is 'L', the element from the start of `a` is used; if the character is 'R', the element from the end of `a` is used. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
