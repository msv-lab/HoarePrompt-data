Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference for each test case. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the sum of its elements and its length.

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty:**
   - The program calculates `P - M`, which is the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This does not correspond to the penalty calculation as defined in the problem.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The program does not perform this calculation.

2. **Lack of Subarray Splitting Logic:**
   - The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. It simply calculates a single value for the entire array.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Parse the input to get the string `s`.
2. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.
3. Implement a logic to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
4. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a correct implementation that addresses the issues:

```python
def min_penalty(s):
    n = len(s)
    a = [1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in s]
    
    # Initialize the minimum penalty
    min_penalty = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible splits
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        penalty = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(n):
            current_sum += a[j]
            if (j + 1) % k == 0 or j == n - 1:
                penalty += abs(current_sum) * k
                current_sum = 0
        min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty)
    
    return min_penalty

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_penalty(s))

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution iterates over all possible subarray lengths and calculates the penalty for each split, then returns the minimum penalty found. This approach ensures that the program correctly follows the problem's requirements.
