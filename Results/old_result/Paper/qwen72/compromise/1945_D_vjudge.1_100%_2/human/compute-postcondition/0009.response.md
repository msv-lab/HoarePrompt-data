Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` with each element between 1 and 10^9. The function computes and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` representing the suffix sums of the list `c`, which contains the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The function does not return any value. **
