### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - It then calculates the suffix sums of `c` and stores them in the list `suff`. The suffix sum `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It iterates over the first `k` positions and updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
   - This calculation ensures that Kirill is among the first `k` people in the queue and minimizes the total cost.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The suffix sum calculation is efficient and correctly reflects the cost of bribing people from position `i` to the end of the queue.
- The minimum cost calculation ensures that Kirill can move to any of the first `k` positions with the least possible cost.

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case:
  - `n = 4`, `k = 2`
  - `a = [7, 3, 6, 9]`
  - `b = [4, 3, 8, 5]`
  - `c = [min(7, 4), min(3, 3), min(6, 8), min(9, 5)] = [4, 3, 6, 5]`
  - `suff = [4 + 3 + 6 + 5, 3 + 6 + 5, 6 + 5, 5, 0] = [18, 14, 11, 5, 0]`
  - The minimum cost is `min(7 + 14, 3 + 11) = min(21, 14) = 14`

- For the second test case:
  - `n = 6`, `k = 2`
  - `a = [6, 9, 7, 1, 8, 3]`
  - `b = [5, 8, 8, 1, 4, 1]`
  - `c = [min(6, 5), min(9, 8), min(7, 8), min(1, 1), min(8, 4), min(3, 1)] = [5, 8, 7, 1, 4, 1]`
  - `suff = [5 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 1, 8 + 7 + 1 + 4 + 1, 7 + 1 + 4 + 1, 1 + 4 + 1, 4 + 1, 1, 0] = [26, 21, 13, 6, 5, 1, 0]`
  - The minimum cost is `min(6 + 21, 9 + 13) = min(27, 22) = 22`

- For the third test case:
  - `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - `a = [7, 2, 9, 2, 6, 5, 9]`
  - `b = [9, 1, 10, 7, 1, 4, 9]`
  - `c = [min(7, 9), min(2, 1), min(9, 10), min(2, 7), min(6, 1), min(5, 4), min(9, 9)] = [7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 4, 9]`
  - `suff = [7 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 9, 1 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 9, 9 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 9, 2 + 1 + 4 + 9, 1 + 4 + 9, 4 + 9, 9, 0] = [33, 26, 25, 16, 14, 13, 9, 0]`
  - The minimum cost is `min(7 + 26, 1 + 25, 9 + 16, 2 + 14, 6 + 13, 5 + 9, 9 + 0) = min(33, 26, 25, 16, 19, 14, 9) = 9`

- For the fourth test case:
  - `n = 2`, `k = 1`
  - `a = [2, 3]`
  - `b = [1, 1]`
  - `c = [min(2, 1), min(3, 1)] = [1, 1]`
  - `suff = [1 + 1, 1, 0] = [2, 1, 0]`
  - The minimum cost is `min(2 + 1) = 3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `k` people in the queue. It handles the input and output as specified and produces the correct results for the given examples.
