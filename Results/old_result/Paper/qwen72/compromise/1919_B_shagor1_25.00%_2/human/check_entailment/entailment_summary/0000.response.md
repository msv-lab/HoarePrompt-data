Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting an array `a` derived from a string `s` of '+' and '-' characters. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to balance the number of '+' and '-' characters in the subarrays as much as possible. 

The function `func_1` calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses this to determine the penalty. The logic used is `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is based on the idea that each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes 1. If the number of '-' characters is equal to the number of '+' characters, the sum of the entire array `a` is zero, and the optimal split would be to keep all elements in a single subarray, resulting in a penalty of 0.

However, if the number of '-' characters is not equal to the number of '+' characters, the program aims to minimize the penalty by balancing the subarrays as much as possible. The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the fact that each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes 1. If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the optimal split would be to have as many balanced subarrays as possible, and the remaining imbalance would be accounted for by the formula.

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the given examples:

1. **Input: "1\n+"**
   - `n = 1`, `s = "+"`
   - `neg = 0`
   - `n - 2 * neg = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - **Output: 1** (Correct)

2. **Input: "5\n-----"**
   - `n = 5`, `s = "-----"`
   - `neg = 5`
   - Since `n == neg`, the output is `5`
   - **Output: 5** (Correct)

3. **Input: "6\n+-+-+-"**
   - `n = 6`, `s = "+-+-+-"`
   - `neg = 3`
   - `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0`
   - **Output: 0** (Correct)

4. **Input: "10\n--+++++++-"**
   - `n = 10`, `s = "--+++++++-"`
   - `neg = 3`
   - `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 3 = 4`
   - **Output: 4** (Correct)

5. **Input: "20\n+---++++-+++++---++-"**
   - `n = 20`, `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`
   - `neg = 10`
   - `n - 2 * neg = 20 - 2 * 10 = 0`
   - **Output: 4** (Incorrect)

The last example is incorrect because the program should output `0` if the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, but it outputs `4`. This suggests that the logic `n - 2 * neg` is not always correct. Specifically, the program should output `0` if the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, regardless of the value of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
