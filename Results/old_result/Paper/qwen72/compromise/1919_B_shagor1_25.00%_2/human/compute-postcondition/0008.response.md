Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user, where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the number of '-' characters in `s` and prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It is designed to handle a single test case at a time. **
