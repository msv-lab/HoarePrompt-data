You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually take two parameters: `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-') and `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). Additionally, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, so the input should include an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '+' or '-', `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: - If `n == neg`, the output will be `n`.
    #   - If `n != neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer indicating the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `s` (a string of length n where each character is either '+' or '-', 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and `n` (an integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000). For each test case, it processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the contents of `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
