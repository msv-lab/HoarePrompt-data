Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. The function simply adds up the values in `sec_arr` and then adds the values of `main_ar` if the sum of the item's profit (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is non-negative. This approach does not consider the constraints and the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
According to the problem description, Alice should buy the items with prices `[1, 2, 1, 4]` and Bob should pay for the items with prices `[3, 3, 2, 3]`. Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends.

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob in this case would be:
- Alice buys all 4 items.
- Bob takes the two most expensive items for free (items with prices 4 and 3).
- Bob pays for the remaining two items (items with prices 1 and 2).

Alice's profit would be:
- Bob pays: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Alice spends: \(1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 8\)
- Alice's profit: \(5 - 8 = -3\)

However, the provided program does not handle this scenario correctly. It does not consider the optimal strategy for Bob to minimize Alice's profit by taking the most expensive items for free. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
