### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads and splits the input into integers, which is used to read the values of `n` and `k` and the lists of prices `a` and `b`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, the program creates a list `arr` of tuples where each tuple contains the negative of Alice's price and Bob's price for each item. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap).
   - The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order based on Bob's prices.
   - A min-heap `k_arr` is used to keep track of the `k` items with the highest Bob prices that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - The program then iterates over the remaining items in `arr` and calculates the potential profit for Alice by considering the items that Bob will take for free and the items that Bob will buy from Alice.
   - The function `func_3` is called to calculate the sum of the profits for the items that Bob will buy from Alice.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - `func_3` takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - It calculates the sum of Alice's profits for the items in `sec_arr` (the items Bob will take for free).
   - It then iterates over the items in `main_ar` and adds the profit for each item where the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices is non-negative.
   - The function returns the total profit.

4. **Optimality**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program correctly identifies the `k` items with the highest Bob prices that Alice should sell to Bob.
   - The program then calculates the profit for the remaining items, ensuring that Bob takes the `k` items with the highest Bob prices for free and buys the rest from Alice.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 (Bob takes no items for free).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` (Bob takes all items for free).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program efficiently keeps track of the `k` items with the highest Bob prices.
   - The sorting step ensures that the program can quickly identify the items Bob will take for free.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit based on the problem description and the constraints. The use of a min-heap and sorting ensures that the solution is both optimal and efficient.

**Correctness: True**
