Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `sub_summ` will contain the total sum of the first elements of each tuple in the list `sec_arr`. The list `sec_arr` itself remains unchanged, and `val_a` will be the last tuple processed by the loop.
