The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
