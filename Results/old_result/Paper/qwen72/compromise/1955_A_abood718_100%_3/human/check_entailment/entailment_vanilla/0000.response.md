### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`).
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them in pairs at the promotion price. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - In this case, the program calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is `A * C / 2`.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is odd.
   - The program calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price (`X = A // 2`), and then buying the remaining one yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
   - The total cost is `X * C + B`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
  - If the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price, it is always better to buy all yogurts individually.
  - The program correctly prints `A * B`.

- **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is even, the program correctly calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
  - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`.

- **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is odd, the program correctly calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one yogurt at the regular price.
  - The program prints `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `2 5 9`**
   - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`
   - `A % 2 == 0` is true, so the cost is `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case: `3 5 9`**
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`
   - `A % 2 != 0` is true, so the cost is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case: `3 5 11`**
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`
   - The cost is `3 * 5 = 15`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case: `4 5 11`**
   - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`
   - The cost is `4 * 5 = 20`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
