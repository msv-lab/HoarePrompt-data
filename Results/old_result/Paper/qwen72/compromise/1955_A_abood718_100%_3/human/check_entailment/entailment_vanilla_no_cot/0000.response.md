Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided has a logical issue in how it calculates the minimum cost. Specifically, the condition `if B * 2 < C:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the regular price of two yogurts is less than the promotional price, but it should actually check if the promotional price is less than or equal to the regular price of two yogurts. Additionally, the logic for handling the case when the number of yogurts is odd is flawed.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= 2 * a:
            # If the promotional price is better, use it as much as possible
            cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        else:
            # Otherwise, buy all yogurts at the regular price
            cost = n * a
        print(cost)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if b <= 2 * a:` checks if the promotional price is less than or equal to the regular price of two yogurts.
   - If true, it calculates the cost by using the promotional price for as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then adding the cost of any remaining single yogurt.
   - If false, it calculates the cost by buying all yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all possible inputs.
