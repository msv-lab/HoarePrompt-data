Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. This matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If true, the function prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price. This is correct.
   - The second condition `elif A % 2 == 0:` checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts using the promotion price as much as possible. This is correct.
   - The third condition `else:` handles the case where `A` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`, which is the cost of buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is correct.

3. **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is what the problem requires.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `A` is 1 (odd), in which case it will print `B`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `A` is 2 (even), in which case it will print `C` if `C` is cheaper than `2 * B`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `A` is greater than 2, both for even and odd values of `A`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `A = 2, B = 5, C = 9`, the function prints `9` because `C` is cheaper than `2 * B`.
   - For `A = 3, B = 5, C = 9`, the function prints `14` because `1 * C + 1 * B` (1 pair + 1 single) is cheaper than `3 * B`.
   - For `A = 3, B = 5, C = 11`, the function prints `15` because `3 * B` is cheaper than `1 * C + 1 * B`.
   - For `A = 4, B = 5, C = 11`, the function prints `20` because `2 * C` is cheaper than `4 * B`.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
