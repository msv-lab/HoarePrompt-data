The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of the list. It returns `-1` if `x` is less than the smallest element in `p`. Otherwise, it returns the index of the largest element in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`. The list `p` and the integer `x` remain unchanged after the function call.
