### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bessie has a regular polygon cake with `n` sides.
   - She has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of sides `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices `y` (which is always 0).
   - The second line of each test case provides the `x` chosen vertices.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The chosen vertices must be used to form the diagonals.
   - The number of triangles formed by a set of vertices in a polygon can be calculated using combinatorial methods, but in this case, we need to ensure that the triangles are non-intersecting.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon with `n` sides is `x - 2`.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The problem can be solved by understanding that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon with `n` sides is `x - 2`.
   - This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the first two vertices can form a triangle, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle without intersecting the previous ones.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code contains a lot of functions, but the main logic for solving the problem is present in the main loop.
   - The main loop reads the input for each test case, sorts the chosen vertices, and then calculates the number of non-intersecting triangles.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`, which is the correct starting point.
   - The code then checks for additional triangles that can be formed by looking at the differences between consecutive vertices.
   - The code also checks for special cases where the first and last vertices can form additional triangles with the polygon's vertices.

6. **Correctness of the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the provided code is correct. It correctly calculates the number of non-intersecting triangles by starting with `x - 2` and then checking for additional triangles.
   - The additional checks for consecutive vertices and special cases are also correct and necessary to ensure all possible triangles are counted.

7. **Irrelevant Functions**:
   - While the code contains many functions that are not used in the main logic, this does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The presence of these functions does not interfere with the main logic and can be ignored.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does solve the problem as described. The main logic correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case. The presence of irrelevant functions does not impact the correctness of the solution.

**Final: **True**
