The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon (4 <= n <= 10^9) and `m` represents the number of edges (diagonals) to be marked (0 <= m <= n). It returns a list of lists `l` with `n + 1` elements in each inner list, all initialized to 0. For each of the `m` iterations, `func_1()` is called to return a pair of integers `(x, y)`, and the elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1. After `m` iterations, the final state of `l` is returned, reflecting the marked edges. The values of `x` and `y` are the ones returned by `func_1()` in the last iteration.
