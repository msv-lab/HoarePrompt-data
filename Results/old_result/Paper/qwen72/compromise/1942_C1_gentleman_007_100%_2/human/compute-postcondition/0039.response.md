To determine what will be printed by the `print(ver, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `graph[ver]` has been processed completely.
   - For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`), `vis[node]` is now set to `True`.
   - These unvisited nodes have been appended to `q` in the order they were processed.
   - `q` must contain at least one element.
   - `ver` is now the first element that was removed from `q`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `graph[ver]` is a list of nodes connected to `ver`.
   - `vis` is a dictionary or list that keeps track of whether each node has been visited.
   - `q` is a queue that contains nodes to be processed.
   - `ver` is the node that was just removed from the queue `q`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, it is the node that was processed most recently.
   - The exact value of `ver` is not explicitly given, but it is known to be the first element removed from `q`.

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element that was removed from the queue `q`)**
