Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the integer that was the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the first two integers that were at the front of `q` at the start of the loop but must contain at least one element, `graph` remains a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and for each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` is now `True` and `q` contains these nodes in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop remain unadded to `q` and their `vis` values are unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `vis[node]` is set to `True` and `node` is appended to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least two elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` now contains `node` as its new last element, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`graph[ver]` must contain at least three elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` was 0 before, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `q` now contains `node` as its new last element. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
