Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` and `b` remain non-empty lists of integers or strings, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, where each element is initialized to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `l`.
- Given that `i` is `len(a) - 1`, the last element of `a` is appended to `l`.
- The initial state specified that `l` is an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and a list containing the last element of `a` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. After executing the code, `l` now contains the last element of `a` regardless of the previous condition, as the code explicitly appends the last element of `a` to `l`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
