Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited, `q` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes `q` as an empty deque, which is a data structure that supports adding and removing elements from both ends. The values of `ver`, `graph`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
