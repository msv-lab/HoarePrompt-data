You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer such that num >= 2.
def func_11(num):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Highest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Lowest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p <= num:
        if prime[p] == True:
            Lowest_Prime[p] = p
            Highest_Prime[p] = p
            for i in range(2 * p, num + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
                Highest_Prime[i] = p
                if Lowest_Prime[i] == 0:
                    Lowest_Prime[i] = p
        
        p += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2, `p` is `num` + 1, and the lists `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` are of length `num` + 1. For each index `i` in the range from 2 to `num` inclusive:
    p = []
    for i in range(num + 1):
        if prime[i]:
            p.append(i)
        
    #State: `num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2, `i` is `num`, and the lists `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` are of length `num` + 1 and remain unchanged for each index `i` in the range from 2 to `num` inclusive. The list `p` contains all indices `i` from 0 to `num` inclusive for which `prime[i]` is `True`.
    return p
    #The program returns the list `p` which contains all indices `i` from 0 to `num` inclusive for which `prime[i]` is `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` (where `num >= 2`) and returns a list of all indices `i` from 0 to `num` inclusive for which `prime[i]` is `True`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `p` which contains all indices `i` from 0 to `num` inclusive for which `prime[i]` is `True`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
