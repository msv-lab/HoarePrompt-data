The only objects in the loop head are `node`, `graph`, and `ver`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `graph[ver]` contains at least one element. The state of `ver` and `q` are already defined, and `vis` is not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust it.

State: **`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node, `node` is the first node in `graph[ver]`**
