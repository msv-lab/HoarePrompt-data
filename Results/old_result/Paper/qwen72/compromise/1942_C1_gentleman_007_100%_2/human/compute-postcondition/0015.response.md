The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains at least one more node, the loop will execute again for the next node. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the second node in `graph[ver]`, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes, and `node` will be the third node in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes. `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`), `q` now contains `node` at the end and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and `q` does not contain `node`.**
