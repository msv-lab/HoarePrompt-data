Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q` at the start of the loop, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` remains a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices. For each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` is now `True` and `q` contains these nodes in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop remain unadded to `q` and their `vis` values are unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the loop processes all unvisited neighbors of `ver` by adding them to the deque `q` and marking them as visited in the `vis` list. The deque `q` will contain all the unvisited neighbors of `ver` in the order they were found, and the `vis` list will reflect that these neighbors have been visited. The initial `ver` value and the `graph` structure remain unchanged.
