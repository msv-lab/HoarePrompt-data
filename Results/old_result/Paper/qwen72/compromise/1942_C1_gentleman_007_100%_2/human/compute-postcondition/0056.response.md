Functionality: ** The function `func_25` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from `ver` and prints each visited vertex. The function updates the `vis` list to mark all reachable vertices from `ver` as visited (1). The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to print the vertices in the order they are visited and update the `vis` list. After the function concludes, `ver` will be the last vertex processed, `q` will be an empty deque, and the `graph` will remain unchanged. **
