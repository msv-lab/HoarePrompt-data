Output State: **`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver` but now contains `node` at the end. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least three nodes. `node` is the third node in `graph[ver]`. `vis[node]` is set to `1`.**
