Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ver` will be the last vertex processed by the loop, and `q` will be an empty deque. The `vis` list will have been updated so that `vis[ver]` is `1` for every vertex `ver` that was processed, indicating that all reachable vertices from the initial `ver` have been visited. The `graph` dictionary or list of lists will remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will continue until the deque `q` is empty, meaning all vertices that were reachable from the initial vertex have been processed.
- The variable `ver` will hold the value of the last vertex that was processed by the loop.
- The `vis` list will be updated to mark all vertices that were processed as visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` will be `1` for each processed vertex).
- The `graph` structure will remain the same, as the loop only reads from it and does not modify it.
