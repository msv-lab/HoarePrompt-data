Postcondition: ***`ver` is the integer that was at the front of the deque `q`, and `q` is a deque that no longer contains the integer `ver`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least two nodes. `node` is the second node in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `False`), `q` now contains `node` at the end and `vis[node]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and `q` does not contain `node`.***
