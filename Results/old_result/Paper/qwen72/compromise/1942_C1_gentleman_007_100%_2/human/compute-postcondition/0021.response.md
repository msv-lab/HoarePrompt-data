Output State: **`ver` is the integer that was the second element of the deque `q` at the start of the loop, `q` is a deque that no longer contains the first two integers that were at the front of `q` at the start of the loop but must contain at least one element, `graph` remains a dictionary or list of lists where each element is a list of adjacent vertices, and for each node in `graph[ver]` that was unvisited (`vis[node]` was `False`) at the start of the loop, `vis[node]` is now `True` and `q` contains these nodes in the order they were processed. Any nodes in `graph[ver]` that were already visited (`vis[node]` was `True`) at the start of the loop remain unadded to `q` and their `vis` values are unchanged.**
