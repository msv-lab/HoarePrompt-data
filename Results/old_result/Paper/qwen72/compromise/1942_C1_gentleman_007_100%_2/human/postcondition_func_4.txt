The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `m`. It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` lists. Each inner list at index `x` contains the values `y`, and each inner list at index `y` contains the values `x` for each pair `(x, y)` generated by `func_1()` over `m` iterations. The function modifies the list `l` by adding the values `y` to the list at index `x` and vice versa, based on the pairs `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()`. After the function concludes, `l` represents an adjacency list for a graph where `n` is the number of vertices, and `m` edges (or diagonals) have been added.
