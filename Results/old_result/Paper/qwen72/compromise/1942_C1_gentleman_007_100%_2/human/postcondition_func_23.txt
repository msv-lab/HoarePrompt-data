The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It marks the vertex `ver` and all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited in the global `vis` variable. The function prints the vertices in the order they are processed, which is a depth-first traversal starting from `ver`. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, and all reachable vertices from the initial `ver` that were not initially visited are marked as visited in `vis`.
