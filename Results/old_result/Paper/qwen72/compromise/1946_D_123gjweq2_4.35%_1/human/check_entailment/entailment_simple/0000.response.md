### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x`.
   - It then reads the array `arr` and calls the function `func_1` with `arr` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the maximum number `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the selected segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - However, the function `func_1` calls `find_max` with `arr` and a fixed value of 31, which is incorrect. The correct value should be the number of bits in `x`, which is `30` (since `0 <= x < 2^30`).

3. **Function `find_max`:**
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the conditions.
   - The base case is when `bit` is `-1`, in which case it returns the length of the current array `cur_arr`.
   - The function iterates over the array `cur_arr` and computes the cumulative XOR `xor`.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
   - After the loop, it checks if the `bit`-th bit of the final `xor` is 1. If it is, it sets `thing1` to `-1`. Otherwise, it recursively calls `find_max` with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`.
   - Finally, it checks if the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1. If it is, it returns the maximum of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. Otherwise, it returns `thing1`.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Bit Value in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with a fixed value of 31, which is incorrect. It should call `find_max` with `30` to match the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
- **False**:
  - The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong bit value in the function `func_1`. This will lead to incorrect results for the test cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, x) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr, x))

# Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 30)  # Corrected to 30

# Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1):
        return len(cur_arr)
    
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    
    if (xor >> bit & 1):
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    
    if (x >> bit & 1):
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1
```

### Correctness:
- **True**:
  - After correcting the bit value in `func_1` to `30`, the program should now correctly determine the maximum number `k` for each test case as described in the problem statement.
