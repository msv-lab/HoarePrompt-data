The only objects in the loop head are variables `y`, `x`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if the range from `x - 1` to `2` (exclusive) contains at least one value. This means `x - 1` must be greater than `1`, or equivalently, `x` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000
- `y` is not defined
- `max_val` is 1
- The function has not yet returned a value

To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be greater than 2. Since `y` is not defined before the loop, it will be defined by the loop itself. The loop starts with `y` set to `x - 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`, `max_val` is 1, and the function has not yet returned a value**
