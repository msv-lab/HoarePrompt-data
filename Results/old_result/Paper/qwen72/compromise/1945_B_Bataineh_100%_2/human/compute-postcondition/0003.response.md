The function `func` appears to be missing the parameters in the provided function signature. Based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it seems the function should accept parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
