Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly. According to the problem description, if both installations have the same launch frequency (`a == b`), the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be `2 + m // a`. However, the program does not account for this specific scenario and may produce incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The correct output should be `12` because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes (from `x` to `x + 10`). Therefore, at any given minute, there will be 11 fireworks from each installation visible, making a total of 12 fireworks visible at the same time. However, the program will output `22`, which is incorrect.
