Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map". For example, consider the string "pipie". The program will only remove the first "pie" and will not remove the overlapping "pie" that starts at the second character, resulting in an incorrect output. The expected output for "pipie" should be 2 (removing the first 'p' and the last 'e' to make the string "ii"), but the program will output 1.
