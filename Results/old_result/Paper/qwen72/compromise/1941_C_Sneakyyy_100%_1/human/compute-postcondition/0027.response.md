The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder that gets incremented by 1 with each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented by 1. However, since `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop condition, it does not need to be explicitly stated in the state. The critical state to consider is the value of `int(input())`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater**
