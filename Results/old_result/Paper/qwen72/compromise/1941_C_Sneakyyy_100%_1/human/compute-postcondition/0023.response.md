Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 9 characters, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`, `i` is increased by 1.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` will now start from the new index `i` and end at `i + 2`.
