Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means that the user is prompted to input an integer, and this integer must be greater than 0. However, this integer is not used in the code snippet provided.
   - `_` is a placeholder. This variable is not used in the code snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This is the same as the first input, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - `a` is an input string. This string is provided by the user.
   - `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2` or greater. This variable is not used in the code snippet.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` is defined as the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
