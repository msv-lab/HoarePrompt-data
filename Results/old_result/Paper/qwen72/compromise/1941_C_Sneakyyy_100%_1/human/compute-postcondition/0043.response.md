The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie'. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + 3`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4.**
