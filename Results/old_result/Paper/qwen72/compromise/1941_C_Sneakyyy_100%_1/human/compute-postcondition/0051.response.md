Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 5 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 3.***
