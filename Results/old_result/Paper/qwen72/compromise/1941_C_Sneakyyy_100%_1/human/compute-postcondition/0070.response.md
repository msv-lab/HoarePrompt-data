The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was either 0 or 1 based on the initial conditions. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` was 1 and is now 2. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` was 0 and is now 1. The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**
