Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3. `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`. `i` is the index of the last character checked in `a` plus 1, which is `len(a) - 2` or greater.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `ans` will contain the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a` without overlapping. The variable `i` will be at least `len(a) - 2`, indicating that the loop has checked all possible substrings of length 3 in the string `a`. The other variables, `n` and `_`, remain unchanged from their initial state.
