Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` assigns the first 3 characters of the string `a` to the variable `s`. Since `i` is 0, the slice `a[i:i + 3]` starts from the first character and includes the next two characters, making `s` the first 3 characters of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
