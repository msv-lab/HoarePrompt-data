The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the `range` value, which is 3. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of 3, which means `k` will take the values 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `k` is less than 3.

Since `k` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 2. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than 3, which it will be in this case.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, [1, `lex - 27`, 26] if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 52`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 2, range is 3**
