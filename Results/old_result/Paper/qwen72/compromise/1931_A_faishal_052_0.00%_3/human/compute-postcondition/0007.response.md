Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list with one element [1], `lex` is an input integer and its current value is less than or equal to 25, `j` is 0, and the range is 2.**

The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `lex - 1`. Since the initial value of `lex` was less than or equal to 26, the new value of `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. The other variables remain unchanged.
