The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range` are not affected by this code. The value of `lex` is also not changed, but the list `arr` will be sorted based on the conditions provided for `lex`.

Let's consider each condition for `lex`:

1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24:
   - `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]` (since `1` is already the smallest and `lex - 3` is also a positive number less than or equal to 21).

2. If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25:
   - `arr` is `[26, 1, 1, lex - 28]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex - 28, 26]` (since `lex - 28` is a positive number less than or equal to -3).

3. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26, 1, lex - 52]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[1, lex - 52, 26, 26]` (since `lex - 52` is a positive number less than or equal to -2).

4. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]` (since `lex - 78` is a positive number less than or equal to -27).

5. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]` (since `lex - 78` is a positive number less than or equal to -1).

6. If `lex` is greater than 77:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`
   - After sorting, `arr` will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]` (since `lex - 78` is a positive number greater than 0).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order.**

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 28, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` is `[1, lex - 52, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[lex - 78, 26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`.
