Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.***
