Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `range` is 3.
   - `lex` is an input integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it. This means `arr` contains at least one element, which is `lex`.
   - `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`.
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will convert the integer `arr[k]` to a character that is `arr[k]` positions before 'a' in the alphabet.
   - Since `arr` is sorted and `lex` is appended to it, the first element of `arr` is the smallest element in the list, which is `lex`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `arr[k]` is `lex`.
   - `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will convert `lex` to a character. Specifically, if `lex` is 1, the output will be 'a' (since `chr(1 + 96) = chr(97) = 'a'`).
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the printed character.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The character printed will be the one corresponding to the integer `lex` in the alphabet, where `lex` is the input integer.

Output: **chr(lex + 96) (where lex is the input integer)**
