Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0, and `range` is 2. If `lex` is between 1 and 25 (inclusive), `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is greater than or equal to 26.***
