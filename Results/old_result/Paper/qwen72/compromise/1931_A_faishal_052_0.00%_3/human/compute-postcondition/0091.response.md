Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` was already defined as an input integer in the initial state, the value of `lex` remains an input integer. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, `k`, and `range`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain unchanged.
