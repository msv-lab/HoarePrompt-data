The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex` because the range `2` ensures that the loop will run twice (from 0 to 1).

However, since the task specifies that we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head to ensure the loop executes, and the loop will always execute due to the range `2`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. The state of `j` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration, and the range `2` is already defined to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0, range is 2**
