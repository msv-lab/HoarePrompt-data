The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. The initial conditions state that if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, it is now greater than or equal to 25, and if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it is now greater than or equal to 26. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, the range is 2, `lex` is now `lex - 26`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 26, 26] if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, otherwise `arr` is a list containing [26, 1, 26] if `lex` was greater than or equal to 26.**
