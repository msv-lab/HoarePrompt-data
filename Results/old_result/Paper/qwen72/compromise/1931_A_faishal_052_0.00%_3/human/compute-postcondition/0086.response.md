The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the `range` value, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the `range` value. If `k` is less than `range`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `range` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, so `k` is 2, and `range` must still be 3 for the loop condition to hold.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 2, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
