Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 51, `lex` is `lex - 26`.** 

In natural language: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range` remain unchanged. The array `arr` remains the same based on the initial conditions of `lex`.
