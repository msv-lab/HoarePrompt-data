The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial values of `arr` depend on the value of `lex`. Let's consider each case:

1. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`]. After sorting, `arr` remains [1, 1, `lex - 2`].
2. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1, `lex - 27`]. After sorting, `arr` becomes [1, `lex - 27`, 26].
3. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex - 52`]. After sorting, `arr` remains [26, 26, `lex - 52`].

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`]. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is [1, `lex - 27`, 26]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex - 52`].**
