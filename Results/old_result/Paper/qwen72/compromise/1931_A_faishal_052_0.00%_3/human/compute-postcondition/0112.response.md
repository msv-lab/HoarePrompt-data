Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.***
