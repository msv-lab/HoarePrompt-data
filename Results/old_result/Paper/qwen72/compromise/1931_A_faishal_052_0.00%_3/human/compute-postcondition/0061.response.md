The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the `range` value, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than the `range` value. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `range` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1, and `range` must still be greater than `j` (i.e., `range` is 3).

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 1, with the current value of `lex` being less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**
