Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]` and `lex` is `lex - 3`. If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1, lex - 28]` and `lex` is `lex - 28`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` is `[26, 26, 1, lex - 52]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]` and `lex` is `lex - 78`.**
