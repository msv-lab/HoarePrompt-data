Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
- `k` is 1.
- `range` is 3 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]`**:
   - `k` is 1, so we need to find the value of `arr[1]` based on the different conditions for `lex`.

2. **Evaluate `arr` based on the value of `lex`**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25:
     - `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
     - `arr[1]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52:
     - `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`.
     - `arr[1]` is `lex - 27`.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52:
     - `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
     - `arr[1]` is 26.

3. **Calculate `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `chr(97)` is 'a', `chr(98)` is 'b', and so on.

4. **Determine the output based on the value of `arr[1]`**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25:
     - `arr[1]` is 1.
     - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52:
     - `arr[1]` is `lex - 27`.
     - `chr((lex - 27) + 96)` is `chr(lex + 69)`.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52:
     - `arr[1]` is 26.
     - `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

### Final Output:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, the output will be 'a'.
- If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, the output will be `chr(lex + 69)`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, the output will be 'z'.

Output: **'a' if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `chr(lex + 69)` if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or 'z' if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52**.
