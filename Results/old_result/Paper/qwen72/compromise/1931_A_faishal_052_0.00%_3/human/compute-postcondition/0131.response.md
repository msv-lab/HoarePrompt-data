To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0 (this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `i` is 2 (this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `j` is 2 (this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `k` is 2 (this is relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `range` is 3 (this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `lex` is the same as before (this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order (this is relevant to the `print` statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert a number to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The number is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 2, so we need to find the value of `arr[2]`.
   - `arr` is sorted in ascending order, but we don't know the exact values of the elements in `arr`.

4. **Determine the Value of `arr[2]`:**
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `arr[2]` is the third smallest element in the list.
   - However, without the exact values of the elements in `arr`, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `arr[2]`.

5. **Convert to ASCII Character:**
   - The `chr` function converts a number to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The number being converted is `arr[2] + 96`.
   - For example, if `arr[2]` is 1, then `arr[2] + 96` is 97, and `chr(97)` is 'a'.
   - If `arr[2]` is 2, then `arr[2] + 96` is 98, and `chr(98)` is 'b'.
   - Generally, `chr(arr[2] + 96)` will convert `arr[2]` to a lowercase letter starting from 'a' (where `arr[2] = 1` corresponds to 'a', `arr[2] = 2` corresponds to 'b', and so on).

6. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.
   - Since `arr[2]` is the third smallest element in the sorted list `arr`, the output will be the lowercase letter corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.

Output: **[chr(arr[2] + 96)] (where arr[2] is the third smallest element in the sorted list arr)**
