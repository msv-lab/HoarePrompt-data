Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`, and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The conditions provided in the initial state indicate that `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, or greater than 77, which means `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`. After executing the code, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and the state of `arr` remains `[26, 26, 26]`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `range`) are not affected by the code.
