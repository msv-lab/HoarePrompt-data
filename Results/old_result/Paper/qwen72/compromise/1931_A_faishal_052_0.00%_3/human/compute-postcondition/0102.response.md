Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer minus 26, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 26.** 

The value of `lex` is updated to be the original input integer minus 26. Since the initial value of `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` is now greater than or equal to 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
