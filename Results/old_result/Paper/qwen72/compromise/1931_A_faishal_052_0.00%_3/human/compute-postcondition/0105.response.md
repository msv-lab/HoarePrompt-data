The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the `range` function with the argument `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `2`.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**
