Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `lex` for each case. This part is correct.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates over the first two positions of the word (since the word is always 3 letters long).
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits into `lex` and subtract that value from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that fits into `lex` and subtract that value from `lex`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The function sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then converts the positions in `arr` to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` and prints them.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then assign the remaining value to the third letter.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the correct approach would be to assign 1 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and 22 to the third letter, resulting in "aav".

5. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the assignment of values to `arr`. It should always try to assign the smallest possible value to the first two letters and then the remaining value to the third letter.
   - The logic for handling `lex` values is flawed. It should not subtract 26 or 1 arbitrarily but should find the smallest possible values that fit into `lex`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
