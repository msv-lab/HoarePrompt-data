Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX value is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `3`, which is incorrect.

**Explanation:**
In this case, the optimal strategy would be:
1. Alice picks 2. Now `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Now `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Now `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Now `a = [3]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
5. Alice picks 3. Now `a = []` and `c = [2, 1, 3]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1, 3]` is `4`, but the program outputs `3`.

The issue lies in the logic for updating the `cur` value and the dictionary `M`. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
