### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted. This is a good step because it helps in efficiently finding the MEX.

2. **Initialization and Dictionary Construction:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is initialized to keep track of the counts of each integer in the array `N`.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the sorted array `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle the case where all integers from 0 to `cur` are present, but the sum of their counts is exactly `S`, meaning `cur + 1` should be the MEX.
   - The function then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any integer `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is to ensure that the MEX is correctly identified.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `cur` for each test case, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Issues:
- **Dictionary Initialization:**
  - The dictionary `M` is not properly initialized to handle all possible values. It should be initialized with all possible keys from 0 to `S-1` with a default value of 0.
- **Sum Check:**
  - The sum check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, not by the sum of counts.
- **Final Loop:**
  - The final loop `for i in range(cur):` should start from 0 and go up to `S` to ensure that all possible values are checked.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = 0
        
        M = {i: 0 for i in range(S)}
        
        for num in N:
            if num >= S:
                continue
            M[num] += 1
        
        for i in range(S):
            if M[i] == 0:
                cur = i
                break
        
        print(cur)
```
