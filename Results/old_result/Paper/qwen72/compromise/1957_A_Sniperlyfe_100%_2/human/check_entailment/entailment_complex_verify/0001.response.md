### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length in the input list `arr`.

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides of the same length.
   - The program calculates the number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length by dividing the frequency of each length by 3 and summing these values.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1` stick of length `1`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct, as no polygon can be formed with a single stick).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2` sticks of lengths `1` and `1`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct, as no polygon can be formed with only two sticks).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6` sticks of lengths `2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct, as we can form one square using the 4 sticks of length 3).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `9` sticks of lengths `4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4`.
  - Output: `2` (Correct, as we can form one pentagon using the 5 sticks of length 2 and one square using the 4 sticks of length 4).

### Issues:

- The program assumes that any group of sticks with a frequency of at least 3 can form a polygon. This is correct because a regular polygon requires at least 3 sides of the same length.
- The program does not explicitly handle the specific number of sides for each polygon. However, the problem statement only asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, not the specific types of polygons. Therefore, the program's approach of dividing the frequency by 3 is valid.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct for the given problem description. It correctly counts the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 and summing these values. The specific number of sides for each polygon is not required by the problem statement, so the program's approach is valid.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
