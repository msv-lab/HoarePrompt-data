Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is the smallest integer in `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in `l`.
   - `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(c)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The user provides an integer `n` which is greater than 0.
   - The user also provides a list of integers `l`.
   - `x` is calculated as `n-1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `a` is determined as the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is determined as the second smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `c` is calculated as the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest integer `b`.

Since the exact values of `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest integer in `l`.

Output: **c (where c is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest integer in `l`)**
