Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. Additionally, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Since both `a` and `b` were initially `float('inf')`, after the swap, `a` remains `float('inf')` and `b` also remains `float('inf')`.
- The condition that `a` is greater than `b` is no longer valid because both `a` and `b` are now equal.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
