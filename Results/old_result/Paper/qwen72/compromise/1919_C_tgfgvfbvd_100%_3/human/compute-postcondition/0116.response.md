Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest value in `l`, `b` is the second smallest value in `l`, `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` is greater than 0**: This is true because the loop must have executed at least once, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`x` is `n-1`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `x` will have reached the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `l`.
- **`a` is the smallest value in `l`**: The variable `a` is updated to the smallest value in the list `l` during the loop execution. This is because the loop checks if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and updates `a` if necessary.
- **`b` is the second smallest value in `l`**: The variable `b` is updated to the second smallest value in the list `l` during the loop execution. This is because the loop checks if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` (after ensuring `a` is the smallest) and updates `b` if necessary.
- **`c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`**: The variable `c` is incremented every time an element in `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`. By the end of the loop, `c` will hold the count of such elements.
