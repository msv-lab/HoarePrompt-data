The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0, and the loop variable `_` must be incremented by 1.

However, `int(input())` is evaluated at the start of each iteration, so it can be a new input or the same input as before. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `_`.

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in `l`, and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than `b`.**
