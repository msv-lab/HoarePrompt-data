Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

The variables `a` and `b` are now set to `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
