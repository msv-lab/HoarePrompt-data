Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[0]` and `a` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1. In all cases, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. After the swap, if `l[0]` is less than or equal to the original `a`, then `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is greater than the original `a` but less than or equal to the original `b`, then `a` is `l[0]` and `b` is `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than both the original `a` and `b`, then `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `l[0]`. If `a` â‰¤ `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[1]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1 or 2, and `a` is set to `l[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
