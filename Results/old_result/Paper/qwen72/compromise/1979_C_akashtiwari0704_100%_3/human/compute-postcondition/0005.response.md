The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
