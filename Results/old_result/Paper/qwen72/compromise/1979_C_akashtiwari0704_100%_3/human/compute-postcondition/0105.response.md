Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is no longer valid, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
