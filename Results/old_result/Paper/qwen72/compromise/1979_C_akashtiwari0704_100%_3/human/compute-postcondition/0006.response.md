Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[1]`. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
