Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a`, `sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition `t` must be greater than `T + 1` is still valid.
- The list `l` is still non-empty.
- The value of `g` is now the result of the expression `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
