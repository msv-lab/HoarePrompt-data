Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least 7 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least five elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is the fourth element of `a`. `x` is the fifth element of `a`. `y` is the sixth element of `a`. `z` is the seventh element of `a`. `u` is now a falsy value (since it was initially truthy and is decremented by 1). `c` is the new value returned by `r()`. `d` is the new value returned by `r()`. `v` is `y - x`. `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1, 2*v, 2, 3*v, 2 + v, 4*v, 2 + 2*v]`. `t` is `False`. Additionally, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
