To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with 4 elements.
- `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
- `z` is `2000000000.0`.
- `u` is `False`.
- `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`.
- `x` is the new value of `c`.
- `y` is the new value of `d`.
- `v` is `d - c` (with the new values of `d` and `c`).
- `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)` (using the new values of `d` and `c`).
- If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, `c` remains less than `d`.
- If the new `c` is greater than or equal to the new `d`, `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are updated to the new values returned by `r()`. Since the function `r()` is not defined, we assume it returns some values. Let's denote these values as `new_c` and `new_d`.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the new value of `c`, so `x = new_c`.
   - `y` is the new value of `d`, so `y = new_d`.

3. **Value of `v`**:
   - `v` is `d - c` with the new values of `d` and `c`, so `v = new_d - new_c`.

4. **Extending `b`**:
   - `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`.
   - The last two elements of `b` are `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.
   - The new elements added to `b` are `b[-2] + (new_d - new_c)` and `b[-1] + (new_d - new_c)`.

5. **Condition on `c` and `d`**:
   - If `new_c < new_d`, then `c` remains less than `d`.
   - If `new_c >= new_d`, then `c` remains greater than or equal to `d`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])`.
   - We need to determine the values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`.

### Final Calculation:
- `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`.
- `b` is extended by two new elements, so the length of `b` is increased by 2.
- The indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` must be valid indices in the list `b`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

### Output:
Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`, and `b` is the list extended by two new elements based on these values)**.
