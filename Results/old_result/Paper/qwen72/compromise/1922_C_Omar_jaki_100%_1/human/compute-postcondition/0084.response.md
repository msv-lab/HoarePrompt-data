To solve this, let's break down the given code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least two elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`.
   - `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
   - `z` is `2000000000.0`.
   - `u` is `0`.
   - `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`.
   - `x` is the final value of `c`.
   - `y` is the final value of `d`.
   - `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`).
   - `b` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `t` is `False`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b[-2]` is `0` (since `b` is `[0, 0]`).
   - `b[-1]` is `0` (since `b` is `[0, 0]`).
   - `v` is `d - c`.
   - `v > x - w` evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`).
   - `v > z - y` evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`).

3. **Boolean Expressions:**
   - `v > x - w` simplifies to `v > c - (-1000000000.0)`, which is `v > c + 1000000000.0`.
   - `v > z - y` simplifies to `v > 2000000000.0 - d`, which is `v > 2000000000.0 - d`.

4. **Calculations:**
   - `v ** (v > x - w)`:
     - If `v > c + 1000000000.0` is `True`, then `v ** 1` is `v`.
     - If `v > c + 1000000000.0` is `False`, then `v ** 0` is `1`.
   - `v ** (v > z - y)`:
     - If `v > 2000000000.0 - d` is `True`, then `v ** 1` is `v`.
     - If `v > 2000000000.0 - d` is `False`, then `v ** 0` is `1`.

5. **Updating `b`:**
   - `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - This means `b` will be extended by the tuple `(b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))`.

### Final Calculation:
- Let's assume `v` is a positive value (since `d` and `c` are the final values returned by `r()` and `d > c`):
  - If `v > c + 1000000000.0` is `True`, then `v ** 1` is `v`.
  - If `v > 2000000000.0 - d` is `False`, then `v ** 0` is `1`.

Thus, the new values added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` = `0 + v` = `v`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` = `0 + 1` = `1`

So, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, 1]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 4 elements: the first element is `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least two elements returned by `r()`, and the last element is `2000000000.0`. `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `u` is `0`, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`, `x` is the final value of `c`, `y` is the final value of `d`, `v` is `d - c` (with the final values of `d` and `c`), `b` is `[0, 0, v, 1]`, `t` is `False`.**
