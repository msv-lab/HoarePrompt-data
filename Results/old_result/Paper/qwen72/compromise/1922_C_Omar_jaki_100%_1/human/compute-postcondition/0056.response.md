Output State: **The list `a` has 4 elements, `w` is `-1000000000.0`, `x` is `c`, `y` is `d`, `z` is `2000000000.0`, `v` is `d - c`, `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`, `u` is now `True - 1` (which evaluates to `True` since `True` is equivalent to `1` in Python).**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was initially `True` (which is equivalent to `1` in Python), after decrementing by 1, `u` becomes `0` (which is equivalent to `False`). All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state is:

- The list `a` has 4 elements.
- `w` is `-1000000000.0`.
- `x` is `c`.
- `y` is `d`.
- `z` is `2000000000.0`.
- `v` is `d - c`.
- `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + (d - c)`.
- `u` is `False`.
