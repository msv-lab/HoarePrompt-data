To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least 5 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + v`.

Given Code:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Identify the current state of `b`:**
   - `b` is a list that has been extended by the elements `b[-2] + v`. This means the last two elements of `b` before the given code are `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.

2. **Evaluate the expressions in the tuple:**
   - The first element in the tuple is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
     - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True` (1), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since `v ** 0` is 1).
   - The second element in the tuple is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.
     - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True` (1), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since `v ** 0` is 1).

3. **Update `b` with the new elements:**
   - `b` will be extended by the results of the above expressions.

Let's assume the initial values for `b` are `[b1, b2, ..., bN]` where `bN-1` and `bN` are the last two elements before the given code. Let's also assume `bN-1` and `bN` are the last two elements added by the extension `b[-2] + v`.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- `bN-1 = b[-2] + v`
- `bN = b[-1] + v`

Now, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`

Since `v` is `y - x`, the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` need to be evaluated:
- If `v > x - w` is `True`, then `v ** (v > x - w)` is `v`.
- If `v > x - w` is `False`, then `v ** (v > x - w)` is `1`.
- If `v > z - y` is `True`, then `v ** (v > z - y)` is `v`.
- If `v > z - y` is `False`, then `v ** (v > z - y)` is `1`.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`
- `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 5 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.**
