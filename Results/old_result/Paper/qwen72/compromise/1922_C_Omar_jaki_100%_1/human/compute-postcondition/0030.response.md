To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list with at least 6 elements starting with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`.
2. `v` is `2000000000.0`.
3. `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + 2000000000.0` and `b[-1] + 2000000000.0` for each iteration of the loop.
4. `u` is now two less than its original value but still non-zero.
5. `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.
6. If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `c >= d` holds true.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **List `a`**: 
   - `a` starts with `[-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0]` and has at least 6 elements. The exact values of the remaining elements are not specified, but they do not affect the calculation of `b`.

2. **Variable `v`**:
   - `v` is `2000000000.0`.

3. **List `b`**:
   - `b` is extended by the elements `b[-2] + 2000000000.0` and `b[-1] + 2000000000.0` for each iteration of the loop.
   - Let's assume `b` starts with some initial values. For simplicity, let's assume `b` starts as `[0, 0]` (the exact initial values do not matter as long as they are consistent with the extension rule).
   - After the first iteration:
     - `b[-2] + 2000000000.0 = 0 + 2000000000.0 = 2000000000.0`
     - `b[-1] + 2000000000.0 = 0 + 2000000000.0 = 2000000000.0`
     - `b` becomes `[0, 0, 2000000000.0, 2000000000.0]`.
   - After the second iteration:
     - `b[-2] + 2000000000.0 = 2000000000.0 + 2000000000.0 = 4000000000.0`
     - `b[-1] + 2000000000.0 = 2000000000.0 + 2000000000.0 = 4000000000.0`
     - `b` becomes `[0, 0, 2000000000.0, 2000000000.0, 4000000000.0, 4000000000.0]`.

4. **Variable `u`**:
   - `u` is now two less than its original value but still non-zero. This does not directly affect the calculation of `b`.

5. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `r()`.
   - If `c` is less than `d`, the condition `c < d` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `c >= d` holds true.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement calculates `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.
   - Since `b` is extended by adding `2000000000.0` to the last two elements, the elements of `b` are in pairs where each pair is `2000000000.0` apart from the previous pair.
   - Therefore, `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` will be elements from these pairs.

### Calculation:
- If `c < d`, then `b[c * 2 - 1]` will be an earlier element in the list compared to `b[d * 2 - 1]`.
- The difference between any two elements in the same position within different pairs is always `2000000000.0 * (d - c)`.

### Example:
- If `c = 1` and `d = 2`, then:
  - `b[c * 2 - 1] = b[1] = 2000000000.0`
  - `b[d * 2 - 1] = b[3] = 4000000000.0`
  - `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] = 2000000000.0 - 4000000000.0 = -2000000000.0`

### Final Output:
Output: **-2000000000.0 (where the exact value depends on the specific values of `c` and `d`, but it will always be a multiple of 2000000000.0)**
