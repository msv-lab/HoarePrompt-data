The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input for each test case. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr` and prints this minimum length. The function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is implicitly managed by the calling context. The function does not modify the input list `arr` or the integer `n`.
