Postcondition: ***`a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is `True`, all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists). If `flag` is `False`, at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` are different, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists).***
