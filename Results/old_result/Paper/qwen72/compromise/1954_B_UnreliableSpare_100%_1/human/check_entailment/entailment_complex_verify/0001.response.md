### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing any elements.
   - This check is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and starts counting the occurrences of the first element `val` in the array.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements found.
   - After the loop, it ensures that the last count is also considered by updating `ans` one final time.
   - This logic is flawed. The program is trying to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is not entirely identical, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - However, the correct approach should be to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the condition that allows the array to be beautiful. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Identical Elements Check**:
  - The check for identical elements is correct. If all elements are the same, the array will always be beautiful, and it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. This is consistent with the problem description.

- **Counting Elements**:
  - The program's logic for counting consecutive elements and finding the minimum count is incorrect. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) exists such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
  - The current logic only counts the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element, which does not address the problem's requirement.

### Correct Approach:

- **Identify the Minimum Removal**:
  - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
  - One way to do this is to iterate through the array and count the number of elements that are part of such sequences. We need to remove these elements to break all such sequences.
  - Specifically, for each element `a[i]` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`, we should consider removing `a[i]` and track the minimum number of such elements that need to be removed.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks for the minimum number of consecutive identical elements, which is not the correct criterion for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The correct approach should focus on breaking the sequences where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
