Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the final inputs provided by the user for the last test case, `num` is the total number of points accumulated based on the equality or inequality of `c` and `r` for all moves in the last test case, `m` is `n - num` for the last test case, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for the last test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values of the last test case's inputs, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves, respectively.
- The variable `num` holds the total number of points accumulated during the last test case, where points are added based on whether the row and column of each move are equal or not.
- The variable `m` is the result of `n - num` for the last test case, representing the remaining moves to be considered.
- The list `dp` is computed for the last test case, where it is initialized with zeros and then populated with values according to the dynamic programming formula provided, up to the value of `m`. This list is used to determine the final output for the last test case.
