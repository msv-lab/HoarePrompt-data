To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `num` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is the default behavior of `range(k)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is 0; `i` is 0**
