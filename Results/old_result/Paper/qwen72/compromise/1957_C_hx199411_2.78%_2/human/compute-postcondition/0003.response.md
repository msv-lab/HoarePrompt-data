The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. These values represent the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The values of `t` and the conditions related to the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.**
