Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again). `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations. `i` is `k-1`. `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`. Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
- The value of `n` and `k` remain as they were initially input by the user, with `k` being the total number of iterations the loop has completed.
- The loop variable `i` is set to `k-1`, indicating the final iteration.
- The variables `c` and `r` hold the values of the last inputs provided by the user during the final iteration.
- The variable `num` is updated based on the conditions within the loop: it is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
