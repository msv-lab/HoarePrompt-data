Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1` (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers input by the user, and `c` is equal to `r`.** 

The value of `num` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
