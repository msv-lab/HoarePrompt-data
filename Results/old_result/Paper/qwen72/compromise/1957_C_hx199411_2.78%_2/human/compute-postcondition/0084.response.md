Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are the last integers input by the user, `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` or by 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the current value of `m` remains 0. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.***
