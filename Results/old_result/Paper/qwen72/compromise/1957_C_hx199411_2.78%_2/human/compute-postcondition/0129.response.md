Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a chessboard of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates a score based on the moves: if a move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), it adds 1 to the score; otherwise, it adds 2. It then computes the remaining squares `m` as `n - score`. If `m` is 0, it prints 0. If `m` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining squares using dynamic programming and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and the final values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` reflect the last test case processed. **
