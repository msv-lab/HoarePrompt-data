Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial moves (r, c) and their mirrored positions (c, r) do not cover all possible rows and columns. Specifically, the program calculates the number of remaining positions as `m = n - num`, where `num` is the number of positions already occupied or mirrored. However, this approach does not account for the fact that some rows and columns might still be available for placing rooks even if `num` is calculated as described.

For example, consider a 4x4 board with the following initial moves:
- Move 1: (1, 2) and (2, 1)
- Move 2: (3, 4) and (4, 3)

Here, `num` would be 4 because each move occupies two positions. However, the remaining positions (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), and (4, 2) are still valid for placing rooks, but the program incorrectly assumes that only `m = n - num = 4 - 4 = 0` positions are left, leading to an incorrect output of 0.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to track the availability of rows and columns separately and ensure that it correctly calculates the number of valid positions remaining for placing rooks.
