Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - max(1, n - 1)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `st` and `end` are both set to 1.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `le - max(1, n - 1)`.
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
