Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than `st - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `st` elements are all equal and the remaining elements from `a[r]` to `a[st]` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `st - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list `a`, `end` is `n - st`, and `ans` is `le - max(st, n - st)`. If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then all elements in `a` are equal, and `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (st + end)`.***
