Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input and the first `st` elements of `a` are all equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- The list `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
- The variable `le` remains the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `l` is set to `st - 1`, where `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal.
- The variable `r` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal.
- The variable `end` remains 1.
- The variable `ans` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and `le - (1 + 1)` if the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal, otherwise it is `le - max(st, end)`.
