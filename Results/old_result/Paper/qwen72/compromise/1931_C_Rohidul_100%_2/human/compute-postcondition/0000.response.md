The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input provided is a valid integer and is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
