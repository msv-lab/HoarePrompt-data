To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
```

The loop will continue to execute if both conditions are true:
1. `l < r`
2. `a[l] == a[l + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `le` is the length of the list `a` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `l` is 1 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `r` is `n - 1` (relevant to the loop condition)
- `st` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `end` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `l` must be less than `r`. Given `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, this condition will be true as long as `n` is greater than 2.
2. `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`. Given `l` is 1, this means `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

Since `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and the list `a` is provided by the user, we need to ensure that `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]` for the loop to execute again. The condition `l < r` is already satisfied because `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, and `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the equality condition `a[1] == a[2]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1**
