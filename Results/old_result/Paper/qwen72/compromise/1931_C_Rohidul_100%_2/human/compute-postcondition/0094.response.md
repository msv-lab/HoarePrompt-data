The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function's output is not specified, but typically in such scenarios, the function would return a result for each test case, possibly a list of results.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the array.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function `func` is expected to process these test cases and return a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the question, so I will describe the general functionality based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an array and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
