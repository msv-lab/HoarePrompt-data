### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, and the game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` as few times as possible.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove the smallest possible integers from `a` as often as possible.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice in `a`, both Alice and Bob can pick it multiple times, but it will not affect the MEX of `c` because `i` will still be in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, Bob can pick it to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a` at all, it will be the MEX of `c`.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using a frequency array `freq`.
   - It then iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once.
   - If `freq[i]` is 0 or 1, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Frequency Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` using a list `freq`.
   - **MEX Calculation**: The program iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once. This is the correct approach to determine the MEX.
   - **Optimal Play**: The program implicitly handles the optimal play by focusing on the smallest integers that are either missing or appear exactly once. Alice will try to include these integers in `c`, and Bob will try to remove them from `a`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `a` by correctly printing `n` as the MEX.
   - The program handles the case where some integers are missing or appear exactly once by correctly identifying the smallest such integer.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- It then iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once.
- The function prints this integer and breaks the loop, which is the correct approach to determine the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. It correctly handles the frequency of integers and identifies the smallest integer that is either missing or appears exactly once.

**Final: True**
