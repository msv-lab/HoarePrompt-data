### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. However, the explanation provided in the original assessment is not entirely accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the frequency of each number in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` and prints the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or is the second unique integer in `arr` that appears exactly once.
   - The function does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the first missing or second unique number in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - To achieve this, Alice and Bob need to strategically pick elements from `arr` to influence the final composition of `c`.

3. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     0 1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
     1. Alice picks 2 (since it is the middle value and will help in maximizing the MEX).
     2. Bob picks 0.
     3. Alice picks 3.
     4. Bob picks 1.
     5. Alice picks 4.
   - At the end, the array `c` will be `[2, 3, 4]`, and the MEX of `c` is 1.
   - The program, however, will output `0` because it does not simulate the game and does not consider the optimal moves of the players.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number that will maximize the MEX, and Bob should pick the smallest available number that will minimize the MEX.
   - This requires a more complex algorithm that keeps track of the available numbers and their frequencies, and simulates the turns of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not implement the optimal strategy for the game and does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
