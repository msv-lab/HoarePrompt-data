The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function prints 'NO' if `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string exceeds 200 characters. If `n` is even and the length of the string is within the limit, it prints 'YES' followed by the string, which consists of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes without returning any value.
