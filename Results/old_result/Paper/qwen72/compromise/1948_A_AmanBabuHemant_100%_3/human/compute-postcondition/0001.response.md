The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but its initial state is not relevant since it is redefined by the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `t` must be greater than 0**
