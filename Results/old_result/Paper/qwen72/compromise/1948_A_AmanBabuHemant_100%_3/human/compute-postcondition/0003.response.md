Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function returns a list of strings, where each string contains exactly `n` special characters for each test case.**
