Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.
3. It sorts the list `nums` in descending order. This ensures that the two books with the most pages are at the first two positions in the sorted list.
4. It prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the most pages, which is the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

The logic is sound because the two books with the highest number of pages will always yield the maximum total number of pages when Alice reads one book from each pile. The program handles the constraints and input format correctly as well.
