The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user, sorts the list in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest integers. The function does not modify any external variables or return any values. After the function concludes, the user will have seen the sum of the two largest integers for each test case.
