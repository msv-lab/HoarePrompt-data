You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_pages(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is also unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the user is prompted to input `n` and a list of `n` integers, which are then sorted in descending order, and the sum of the two largest integers is printed. The variables `n` and `nums` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. It returns the maximum number of pages found in any book across all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
