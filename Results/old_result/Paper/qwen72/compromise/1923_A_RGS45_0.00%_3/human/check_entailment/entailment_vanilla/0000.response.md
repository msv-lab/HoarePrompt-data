### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (1) in the array.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (1) in the array when reversed. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the end of the array.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - The program then extracts the subarray `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This subarray `z` contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - Finally, the program prints the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to count the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is indeed the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
- The logic is sound because moving chips to form a single block without any free cells between them can be achieved by moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are contiguous.
- The subarray `z` correctly captures the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the subarray `z` will contain only that chip, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Chips Already in a Block:** If all chips are already in a single block, the subarray `z` will contain no free cells, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Multiple Free Cells Between Chips:** The program correctly counts the free cells between the first and last chip, which is the minimum number of moves required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
