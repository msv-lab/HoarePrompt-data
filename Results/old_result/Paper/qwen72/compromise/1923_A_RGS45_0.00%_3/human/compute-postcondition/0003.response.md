The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The list `cases` contains `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)`. The tuple `(n, a)` consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), representing the cells of a ribbon. Each cell `a_i` can be either 0 (indicating a free cell) or 1 (indicating a cell with a chip). Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is a string indicating whether it is possible to move all chips to a single cell. If it is possible, the result is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple `(n, a)` in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). The function returns a list of strings, each indicating whether it is possible to move all chips to a single cell for the corresponding test case. If possible, the string is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".**
