You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon, with a_i = 0 indicating a free cell and a_i = 1 indicating a cell with a chip. Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a string `arr` representing the cells of the ribbon. It will then find the first and last positions of the chip (1) in the ribbon, extract the substring between these positions, and print the number of free cells (0) in this substring. After all iterations, the initial variables `t` and the list of tuples will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple `(n, a)` in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). The function returns a list of strings, each indicating whether it is possible to move all chips to a single cell for the corresponding test case. If possible, the string is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
