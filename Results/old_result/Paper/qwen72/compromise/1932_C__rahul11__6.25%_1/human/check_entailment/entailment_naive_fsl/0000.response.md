Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the product of the elements in the array is zero or when the array contains a zero. When the product is zero, or the array contains a zero, dividing by any element of the array (which includes zero) will result in a division by zero error. This is a critical flaw in the logic of the program.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 7
0 2 3
LRL
```
The expected output should be:
```
0 0 0
```
However, the program will encounter a division by zero error when it tries to divide the product by the first element (which is 0) after the first command 'L'. This makes the program incorrect.
