Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `i * i`, `i` is `m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `i * i`, where `i` is `m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
