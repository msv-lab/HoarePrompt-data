Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is initialized to 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is `m`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (n - 1 - l)`, `k` is `n - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` will take the values of `n` and `m` in sequence during the loop iterations, `ans` is updated to `ans * i` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `n`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
