Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, and the character at index `k` in the string `s` is 'L', `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
