Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input.
- `i` remains `m`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.
- `res[0]` is assigned the value of `ans % m % MOD`, where `MOD` is a predefined constant. The exact value of `res[0]` depends on the values of `ans`, `m`, and `MOD`, but it is calculated as `ans % m % MOD`.
