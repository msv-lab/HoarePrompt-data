Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `l` is `l + 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is `r - 1`.**

The value of `r` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
