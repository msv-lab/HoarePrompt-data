Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, where the input is a single line with two space-separated integers, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `n * m`, `i` is `m`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `n * m // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `ans` is `n * m // m % MOD`, `i` is `m`, `c` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L' and 2 otherwise, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L' and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 2` otherwise, `k` is 0, and the first character of `s` is 'L' or not 'L' as per the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is `(n % MOD) // m % MOD`, `c` is 4, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is 3, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 3` otherwise. `i` is `m`, `k` is 1, and the first character of `s` is 'L' or not 'L' as per the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer provided by the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the 4th element updated to `ans % m % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise the 3rd element is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. `i` is `m`, `k` is 2, `c` is 5 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` is 4, `l` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
