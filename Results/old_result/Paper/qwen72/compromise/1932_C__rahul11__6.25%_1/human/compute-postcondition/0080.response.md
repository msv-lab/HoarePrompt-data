Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is `l + 1`.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
