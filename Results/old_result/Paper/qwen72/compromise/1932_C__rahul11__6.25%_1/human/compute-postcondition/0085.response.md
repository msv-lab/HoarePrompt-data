Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated based on the first character of the string `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `k` is `n - 1`.**
