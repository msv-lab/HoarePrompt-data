Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with `q[w[0]]` incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` incremented by 1, and `q[w[2]]` incremented by 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1.
- Since `j` is 2, `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state specifies that `q[w[0]]` and `q[w[1]]` were already incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The length of `q` is still `n + 1`.
- The other elements in `q` remain zeros, except for `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, and `q[w[2]]` which are incremented by 1.
