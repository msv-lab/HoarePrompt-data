The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
