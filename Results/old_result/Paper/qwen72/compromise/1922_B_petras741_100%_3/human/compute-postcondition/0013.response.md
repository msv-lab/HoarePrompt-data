Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains the same as the initial input integer, within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The value of `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, which is greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` remains unchanged, as it is only used to index `q` but not modified.
- The list `q` is now a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where each element `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1 for every `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop variable `j` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
