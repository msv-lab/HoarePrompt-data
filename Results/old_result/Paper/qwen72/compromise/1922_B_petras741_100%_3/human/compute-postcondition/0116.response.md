The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be at least 0 to ensure that `j` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 0. If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing `[1, 1]`. Otherwise, `eta` is a list containing `[1]`.**
