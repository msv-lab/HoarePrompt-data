Output State: **`j` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n + 1` times, with `j` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`.
- After the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `j` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The list `eta` will contain all the indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0 for any `j`, that index will not be added to `eta`.
