Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the integers `1` and `2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` remains a list of integers.
- The list `q` remains a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The list `eta` initially contains the integer `1`. After the code `eta.append(j)` is executed, `eta` now contains the integers `1` and `2`.
