To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations performed on the variables. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `w` is a list of integers.
   - `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
   - Each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.
   - `j` is `eta_ln`.
   - `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
   - `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `q` is a frequency list where `q[w[j]]` is incremented for each element in `w`.
   - `eta` is a list of unique indices in `q` that have a non-zero frequency.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
   - `rho` is the sum of the frequencies of all unique indices in `eta`.

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - The first part of `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each frequency in `q[eta[j]]`:
     \[
     \sum_{j=0}^{\eta_{ln}-1} \frac{q[\eta[j]] \cdot (q[\eta[j]] - 1) \cdot (q[\eta[j]] - 2)}{6}
     \]
   - The second part of `res` is the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each frequency in `q[eta[j]]` and then multiplying by the sum of all previous frequencies:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{\eta_{ln}-1} \left( \frac{q[\eta[j]] \cdot (q[\eta[j]] - 1)}{2} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{j-1} q[\eta[k]] \right)
     \]

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the sum of the two parts described above.

Since the exact values of `w` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each frequency in `q[eta[j]]` plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each frequency in `q[eta[j]]` multiplied by the sum of all previous frequencies in `eta`)**
