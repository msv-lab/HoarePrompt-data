Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, and `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has executed `x - 1` times, where `x` is the initial number of iterations specified.
- The variable `_` has reached the value `x - 1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from the input, `b` has been appended to the list `lst[a]`, and `a` has been appended to the list `lst[b]`.
- The lists `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` now contain all the values that were appended during the loop's execution, reflecting the edges of the tree as specified by the input pairs.
