The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` where the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`. It checks whether it is possible to balance the water levels in the containers represented by the list `a` such that each container has the same amount of water. If it is possible to balance the water levels without any container having a negative amount of water during the process, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the function returns either 'Yes' or 'No'.
