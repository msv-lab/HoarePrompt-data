Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.** 

The initial state remains the same, with the addition that `total_water` is now assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `a`. Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is also divisible by `n`.
