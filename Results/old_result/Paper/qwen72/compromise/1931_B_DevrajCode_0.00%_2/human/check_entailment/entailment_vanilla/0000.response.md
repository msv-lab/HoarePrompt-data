Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then assumes the first element is the number of test cases, `n`, and the rest are the elements of the array `a`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases properly. The input format specifies that each test case has its own `n` and `a` values, and these should be processed separately.

2. **Sum and Target Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - The target amount of water in each container is correctly calculated as `total_water // n`.

3. **Container Balancing**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and keeps a running total of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is based on the idea that if the running total becomes negative, it means that the current container cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the first test case only. It does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and it incorrectly processes the input. The logic for determining if the containers can be balanced is correct, but the implementation is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
