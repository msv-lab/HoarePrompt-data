You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in a list `char_count` of 26 zeros, which is then converted to a corresponding lowercase letter. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly reconstruct a string from its trace according to the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string and the trace array `a`.

2. **String Reconstruction**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `s` and an array `char_count` of size 26 (one for each lowercase Latin letter).
   - It iterates through each element `a[i]` in the trace array.
   - For each `a[i]`, it finds the first letter (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - It appends this letter to the string `s` and increments the count of this letter in `char_count`.

3. **Trace Matching**:
   - The trace array `a` is constructed such that `a[i]` is the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string.
   - The program correctly ensures that for each `a[i]`, the character added to `s` has exactly `a[i]` previous occurrences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will output a single character 'a' (since the trace for a single character string is always `[0]`).
   - The program also handles cases where the trace array has multiple zeros correctly, as it will output a string with multiple 'a's.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the trace array is strictly increasing, as it will output a string with each character appearing a unique number of times.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the string `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters.
   - The program handles the constraints on `t` and `n` as specified in the problem description.

Given the above points, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
