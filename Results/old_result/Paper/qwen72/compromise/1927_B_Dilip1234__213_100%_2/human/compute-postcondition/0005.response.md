The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The function returns a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in `char_count` (converted to a corresponding lowercase letter). The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
