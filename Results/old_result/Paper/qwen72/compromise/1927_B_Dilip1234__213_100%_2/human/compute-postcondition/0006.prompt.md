You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: `s` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in `char_count` (converted to a corresponding lowercase letter), and `char_count` is updated to reflect the counts of these characters. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in `char_count` (converted to a corresponding lowercase letter). The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` corresponds to the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in `char_count`, converted to a lowercase letter. The input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the first occurrence of the value `a[i]` in `char_count` (converted to a corresponding lowercase letter). The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
