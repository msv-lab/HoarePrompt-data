### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Array Validation:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to check if the array is already strictly increasing. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` because the beauty of a strictly increasing array is `0` (since \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\) will be positive, and rearranging won't change this).

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If the array is not strictly increasing, the program sorts the array (`b = sorted(a)`) and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((b_2 - b_1) + (b_3 - b_2) + \ldots + (b_n - b_{n-1})\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing by iterating through the array and counting the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
- If the count (`order`) is `0`, it means the array is strictly increasing, and the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is strictly increasing, but this is not necessary for the problem. The problem asks for the maximum beauty, which is always achieved by sorting the array.
  - The function `func_1` is not needed and can be removed to simplify the program.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it uses an unnecessary function `func_1` to check if the array is strictly increasing, which is not required for the problem.
- The corrected program, which simply sorts the array and calculates the beauty, is **correct**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
