Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. `_` is 0.
4. `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0.
5. `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed.
6. The last element of `nums` is \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\).
7. `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `nums` Construction**:
   - `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), but one element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed.
   - The last element of `nums` is \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\).

2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).
   - For example, if \( k = 5 \), then \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the smallest power of 2 greater than 5, so `idx` would be 3.

3. **Remove \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums`**:
   - After determining `idx`, remove \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the list `nums`.

4. **Add the last element**:
   - The last element of `nums` is \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\).
   - Since \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed, `nums[idx]` is the element that was removed, so the last element is \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose \( k = 5 \):
  - The smallest \( \text{idx} \) such that \( 5 < 2^{\text{idx}} \) is 3.
  - The list `nums` would initially be: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
  - Remove \(2^3 = 8\): \([1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
  - The last element is \(5 + 8 + 1 = 14\).
  - The final list `nums` is: \([1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 14]\).

### General Case:
- For any given \( k \), the list `nums` will be constructed similarly:
  - Remove \(2^{\text{idx}}\) where \(\text{idx}\) is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).
  - Append \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) to the list.

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces. The elements will be the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the last element which is \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8388608 [k + 2^idx + 1] (where idx is the smallest integer such that k < 2^idx)**

This output is a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
