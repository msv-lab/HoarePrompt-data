Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\). `idx` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `idx` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `idx` being the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1 is no longer relevant in the output state because `idx` is explicitly set to 0.
