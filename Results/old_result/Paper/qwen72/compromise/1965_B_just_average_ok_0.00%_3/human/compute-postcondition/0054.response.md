Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, excluding the elements \(2^{\text{idx}}\) for each test case, and includes additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` for each test case, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) for each test case.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000, indicating the total number of test cases.
- The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1` after all iterations, meaning the loop has run `t` times.
- The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). For each test case, the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`, and three new elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\).
- The state of `n` and `k` for each test case is determined by the input provided during the loop execution, and these variables are not retained between test cases.
- The final `nums` list will have 24 elements for each test case, but the elements will differ based on the values of `k` and the corresponding `idx` for each test case.
