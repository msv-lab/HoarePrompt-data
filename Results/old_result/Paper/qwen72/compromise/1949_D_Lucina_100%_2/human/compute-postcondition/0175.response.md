Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is an empty string, and the construction of `nx` from `xx[2]` has not yet started.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is 3, and this value remains unchanged.
- The initial value of `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and this value remains unchanged.
- The initial state described the construction of `nx` from `xx[2]`, but the code snippet `nx = ''` resets `nx` to an empty string, effectively undoing any previous construction.
- The string `xx[2]` and the list `sa` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.
- The condition for appending characters to `nx` (based on the characters in `xx[2]` and the values of `i` and `j` in `sa`) is still valid, but the construction of `nx` has not yet started because `nx` is now an empty string.
