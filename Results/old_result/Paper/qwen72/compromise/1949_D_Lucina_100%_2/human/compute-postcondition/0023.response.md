The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3**
