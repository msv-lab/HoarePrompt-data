Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` remains an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. The length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `j` is `n + 1`. `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 1, and `nx` is either the first character of `xx[3]` (if it is not equal to '?') or 'S' if the first character is '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 2, and `nx` is either the first character of `xx[3]` (if it is not equal to '?') or 'S' if the first character is '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'. If `xx[3][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is now the original `nx` value plus the character at index 1 of `xx[3]`. If `xx[3][1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is either 'FS' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'F' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 3, and `nx` is determined as follows: If `xx[3][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` (if it is not equal to '?') or 'S' if the first character is '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F', followed by the character at index 2 of `xx[3]`. If `xx[3][2]` is equal to '?', `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` (if it is not equal to '?') or 'S' if the first character is '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'. If `xx[3][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is now the original `nx` value plus the character at index 1 of `xx[3]` followed by 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or followed by 'F' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`. If `xx[3][1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is 'FSS' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'FF' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
