Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string. If `x[1]` is 'F', `a[j]` and `a[i]` are both incremented by 1. If `x[1]` is 'S', `b[j]` and `b[i]` are both incremented by 1.***
