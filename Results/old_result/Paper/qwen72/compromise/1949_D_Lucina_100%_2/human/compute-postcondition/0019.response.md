The value at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `b` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, the value at index 1 of `b` remains unchanged, the value at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 1, and the element at index 0 of `x` can still be 'F', 'S', or any other value.**
