The function `func` accepts a list of strings as its parameter. Each string in the list is of length `n`, and the list itself contains `n` strings, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The characters in each string can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The input list represents a symmetric matrix, meaning the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.'. Additionally, at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a specific output based on the input matrix, but the exact return value is not provided in the constraints. However, given the constraints, we can infer that the function likely processes the matrix to determine some property or state based on the distribution of 'F', 'S', '?', and '.' characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a symmetric matrix represented as a list of n strings, each of length n, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each character in the matrix can be 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with the diagonal always being '.' and at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters being 'F' or 'S'. The function returns a value based on the input matrix, but the specific return value is not defined in the constraints.**
