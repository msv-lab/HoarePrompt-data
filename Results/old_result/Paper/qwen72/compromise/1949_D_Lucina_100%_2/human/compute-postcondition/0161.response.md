Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is `nx` + `xx[2][1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[2][1]` to its current value. The exact value of `xx[2][1]` is not provided, so we represent the new value of `nx` as `nx` + `xx[2][1]`.
