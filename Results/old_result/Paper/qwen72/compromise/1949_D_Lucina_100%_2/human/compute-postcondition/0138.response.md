Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, and `nx` is either the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` if it is not '?', or 'FF' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'FS' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SF' if the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'SS' otherwise.***
