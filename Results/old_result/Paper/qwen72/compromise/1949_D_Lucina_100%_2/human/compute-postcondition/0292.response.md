Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed for each `i` from 1 to `n` by iterating through the first `n` characters of `xx[i]`. For each character in `xx[i]` at position `j - 1` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`), if the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed for each `i` from 1 to `n` by iterating through the string `xx[i]` from the 0th index to the `n-1`th index. For each character in `xx[i]` at index `j-1` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`), if the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', and if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
