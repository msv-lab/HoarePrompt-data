Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. The length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. The length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `j` is `n + 1`. `nx` is a string where each character at position `j - 1` (for `j` from 1 to `n`) is the corresponding character from `xx[1]` if it is not '?'. If the character is '?', and if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then the character in `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, the character in `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`. The length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `j` is `n + 1`. `nx` is a string that has been constructed by iterating through the string `xx[2]` from the 0th index to the `n-1`th index. For each character in `xx[2]` at index `j-1` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`), if the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the rules of the loop: if `xx[3][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is taken from `xx[3][j - 1]`; if `xx[3][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, the character is 'S'; otherwise, the character is 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
