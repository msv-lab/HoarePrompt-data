### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - **Odd `n`**:
     - If `n` is odd, the function checks if the price of two single yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints the total cost as `n // 2 * b + a` because buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buying one additional yogurt individually is cheaper.
   - **Even `n`**:
     - If `n` is even, the function checks if the price of two single yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints the total cost as `n // 2 * b` because buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price is cheaper.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected behavior based on the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 1, the function will always print `a` because it is impossible to use the promotion.
   - If `n` is 2, the function will print `b` if `b` is cheaper than `2 * a`, otherwise it will print `2 * a`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `2 5 9`:
     - `n` is even, `2 * a` is 10, and `b` is 9. The function prints `9` which is correct.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`:
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a` is 10, and `b` is 9. The function prints `14` which is correct (`1 * 9 + 1 * 5`).
   - For the test case `3 5 11`:
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a` is 10, and `b` is 11. The function prints `15` which is correct (`3 * 5`).
   - For the test case `4 5 11`:
     - `n` is even, `2 * a` is 10, and `b` is 11. The function prints `20` which is correct (`4 * 5`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. It handles both odd and even values of `n` and the different pricing conditions as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
