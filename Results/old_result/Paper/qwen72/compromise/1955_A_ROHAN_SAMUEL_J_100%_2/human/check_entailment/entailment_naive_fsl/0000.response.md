Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than the regular price for two yogurts `2 * a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a scenario, the program might not always provide the minimum cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`.

- The regular price for 3 yogurts is `3 * 5 = 15` burles.
- The promotion price for 2 yogurts is `8` burles, and the regular price for 1 yogurt is `5` burles, so the total cost is `8 + 5 = 13` burles.

The correct minimum cost should be `13` burles, but the program will output `15` burles, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks `if 2 * a < b` and then prints `a * n` for odd `n`. This does not consider the possibility that using the promotion price for as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price might be cheaper.
