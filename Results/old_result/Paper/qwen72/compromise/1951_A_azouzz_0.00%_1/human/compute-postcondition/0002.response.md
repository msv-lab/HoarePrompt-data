Output State: **The values of `start`, `end`, and the current working directory remain unchanged. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has taken an integer `n` and a string `s` as input, processed them according to the conditions, and printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions. The final output state is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has completed its `t` iterations.**
