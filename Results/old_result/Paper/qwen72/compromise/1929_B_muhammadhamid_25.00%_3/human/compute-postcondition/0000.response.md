The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop variable, and the `range(int(input()))` expression, which determines the number of iterations. The loop will execute if the `range` function receives a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to `range` is a positive integer.

State: **The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), and the input to `range` must be a positive integer.**
