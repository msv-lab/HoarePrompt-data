Reasoning:  
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the correctness of each function:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.
   - **Logic**: The function iterates through each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES', indicating that a valid template exists. If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Correctness**: This logic is correct because if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is the uppercase version of `c[i]`. This ensures that `a` and `b` match the template (since they differ from the lowercase version of `t[i]`), while `c` does not (since it matches the lowercase version of `t[i]`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases and call `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Logic**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. It collects the results in a list and prints them one by one after all test cases are processed.
   - **Correctness**: This logic is correct as it follows the problem's input and output format. It ensures that each test case is processed independently and the results are printed in the correct order.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is sound and `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
