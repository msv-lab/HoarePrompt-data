Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding characters in `c`. However, it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not, according to the rules specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The function `func_1` will return 'YES' because `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for all `i`. However, there is no template that can satisfy the conditions for this input. The correct output should be 'NO'.

The program fails to correctly handle this case, and thus it is incorrect.
