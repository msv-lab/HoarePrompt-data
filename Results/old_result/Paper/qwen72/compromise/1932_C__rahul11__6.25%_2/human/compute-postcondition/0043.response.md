Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[c]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
