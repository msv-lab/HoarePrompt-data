To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is `n - 1`
   - `c` is `n`
   - `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`
   - `r` is `n - 1 - l`
   - `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration
   - `ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `k` is `n - 1`, which is one less than the length of `s`.
   - `c` is `n`, which is the length of `s`.
   - `l` is the count of 'L' characters in `s`.
   - `r` is `n - 1 - l`, which is the count of remaining characters in `s` after accounting for 'L' characters.
   - `res` is a list of `n` integers, each element of which is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration. The exact value of `ans` is not provided, but it is the final value after all operations.

3. **Output of `print(*res)`:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print all elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.
   - Each element in `res` is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration.
   - Since the exact values of `ans`, `m`, and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`.

Given the initial state and the variables, the output will be a sequence of `n` integers, each of which is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration. The exact values of these integers cannot be determined without more specific information about `ans`, `m`, and `MOD`.

Output: **[res[0], res[1], ..., res[n-1]] (where each res[i] is the result of ans % m % MOD after the i-th iteration)**
