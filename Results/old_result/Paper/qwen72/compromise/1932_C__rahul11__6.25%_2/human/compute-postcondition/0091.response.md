Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[2]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `res[3]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[1]` modulo `MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L'. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` where `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 1` depending on whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not, `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`, `c` is 3, `k` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.** 

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates `res[c]` with the value of `ans % m % MOD`.
- Since `c` is 3, `res[3]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `res[2]`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The initial state information that is still valid is included in the output state.
