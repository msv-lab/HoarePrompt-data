Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least `m` elements, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `res[1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` and `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[l]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `res[1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` and `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1.**
