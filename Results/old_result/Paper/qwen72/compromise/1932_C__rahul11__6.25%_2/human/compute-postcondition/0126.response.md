Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` updates the value of `ans` to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1 as part of the initial state.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1 as part of the initial state.
- `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` as part of the initial state.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The first element of the string `s` determines the update to `ans`, and in this case, it is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
