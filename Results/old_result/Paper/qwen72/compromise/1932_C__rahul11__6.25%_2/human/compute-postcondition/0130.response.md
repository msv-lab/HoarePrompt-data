Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 1, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. The other conditions and variable states remain unchanged: `n` is still greater than 2, `k` is still 1, `c` is still increased by 1, `ans` is still updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `r` is still decremented by 1.
