Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 1, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the new `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in the new `s`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`.**

The variable `ans` is updated to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
