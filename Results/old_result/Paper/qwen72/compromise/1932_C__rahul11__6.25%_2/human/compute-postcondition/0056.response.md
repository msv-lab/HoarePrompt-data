Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `i`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the new `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in the new `s`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`, `i` is the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 1.
- `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `i`, which is the first element of `arr`.
- After the multiplication, `ans` is now equal to `i`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
