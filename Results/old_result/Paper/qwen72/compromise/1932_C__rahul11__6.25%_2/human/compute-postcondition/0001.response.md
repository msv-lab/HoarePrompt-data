The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value, which means the input must be a positive integer. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is not directly in the loop head, but it is implied by the input.

Given the task, the loop will execute if the input is a positive integer, and the variable `_` will start at 0 (the first iteration of the loop).

State: **`_` is 0, the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
