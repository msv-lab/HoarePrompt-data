Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` and `res[1]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]` divided by `arr[l]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if the first character of `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 2, and `k` is 1.** 

In natural language: The variable `ans` is updated to the result of dividing the current value of `ans` by the value at index `l` of `arr` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `res[0]` and `res[1]` are both set to `ans % m % MOD`. The value of `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1` if the first character of `s` is 'L'. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`. The variable `i` is set to the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 2, and `k` is 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged.
