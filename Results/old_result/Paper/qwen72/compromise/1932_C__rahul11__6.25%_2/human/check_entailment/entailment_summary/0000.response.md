Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described:

1. **Modulo Operation**: The problem specifies that the output should be the remainder of the product of the array elements when divided by `m`. However, the program uses an additional modulo operation with `10^9 + 6` (stored in `MOD`). This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The `MOD` variable should be removed, and the modulo operation should only be performed with `m`.

2. **Division and Modulo**: When removing elements from the array, the program uses integer division (`//`) followed by a modulo operation. However, integer division can lead to precision issues, especially when the product is large. Instead, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division under modulo. However, for simplicity and given the constraints, we can assume that the division will work correctly if the product is managed properly.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product of the array elements should be calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow issues. The program currently calculates the full product and then takes the modulo, which can be inefficient and prone to overflow for large arrays.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the array is reduced to a single element and then removed. The division by the last element should still be correct.

5. **Output Format**: The program should print the results for each test case, which it does correctly.

Given these points, the program can be corrected by removing the unnecessary `MOD` and ensuring the product is managed correctly under modulo `m`.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                r -= 1
        print(*res)
```

Explanation:
- **Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: To handle division under modulo, we use the modular multiplicative inverse. For a given element `a` and modulo `m`, the inverse is `a^(m-2) % m` (using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is valid for prime `m`).
- **Initial Product**: The initial product is calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow.
- **Removing Elements**: When removing elements, we multiply the current product by the inverse of the element being removed, and then take the result modulo `m`.

Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary `MOD` and potential precision issues with integer division. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
