You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: _ is t-1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the final input, `s` is a list of characters from the final input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration, `ans` is the final value after all divisions and modulo operations, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, and `k` is `n - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of `n` integers `arr` (1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a list `res` of `n` integers. The first element of `res` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are calculated by iteratively dividing the current product by the corresponding element in `arr` based on the direction specified by `s` ('L' or 'R'), and then taking the result modulo `m` and `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `res` of length `n` to store the results.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 1, which will be used to store the product of the elements of the array.

3. **Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - This is done using a loop that multiplies each element of `arr` to `ans`.

4. **First Command Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the remainder of the initial product when divided by `m` and `MOD` (which is \(10^9 + 6\)).
   - However, the use of `MOD` is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem. The problem only requires the remainder when divided by `m`.

5. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program processes each command in the string `s` from left to right.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of the array and updates the result.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of the array and updates the result.
   - The program uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the current leftmost and rightmost elements of the array.

6. **Result Storage:**
   - The program stores the results in the `res` list and prints them at the end of each test case.

7. **Division and Modulo:**
   - The program uses integer division (`//`) to remove elements from the product. This is correct for integer arithmetic.
   - However, the use of `MOD` in the division and result storage is incorrect and unnecessary.

### Issues:
- **Use of `MOD`:** The program incorrectly uses `MOD` (which is \(10^9 + 6\)) in the modulo operations. The problem only requires the remainder when divided by `m`. This can lead to incorrect results.
- **Division by Zero:** If any element in the array `arr` is 0, the division operation will fail. However, the problem guarantees that all elements are positive integers, so this is not a concern.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program without the unnecessary `MOD`:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l]
                res[k + 1] = ans % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r]
                res[k + 1] = ans % m
                r -= 1
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided, due to the incorrect use of `MOD`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect use of `MOD` in the modulo operations).
