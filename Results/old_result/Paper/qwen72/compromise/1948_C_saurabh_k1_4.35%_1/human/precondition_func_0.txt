The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even), and a list of two strings, each of length n, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
