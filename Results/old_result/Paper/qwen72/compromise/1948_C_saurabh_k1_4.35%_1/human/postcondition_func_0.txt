The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, and two lists of strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. The function then checks if the second-to-last character in the list `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any state between test cases.
