Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps: a voluntary move followed by a forced move along the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (<) or right (>).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns).
   - It then reads the arrows in the first row `a` and the second row `b`.
   - The program checks if the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) (i.e., `b[n-2]`) is pointing left (`<`).
   - If `b[n-2]` is `<`, it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The robot needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the right or down from the first row.
   - To reach the last column in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the right until it reaches column `n`.
   - The critical point is the cell (2, n-1). If the arrow in this cell points left (`<`), the robot will be forced back to the left and cannot reach the cell (2, n).
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) points right (`>`), the robot can move to the right and reach cell (2, n).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `n` is even, as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The program also assumes that the input is valid and does not contain arrows pointing outside the grid, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) by checking the arrow in cell (2, n-1).
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is `<`, the robot cannot reach the target cell, and the program prints 'No'.
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is `>`, the robot can reach the target cell, and the program prints 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.
