Reasoning:

The provided solution checks if the second-to-last character in the second row of arrows (`b[n - 2]`) is pointing to the left (`'<'`). If it is, the function prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

However, this logic is flawed. The robot's movement is not solely determined by the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and then follows the arrow in the current cell. To determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to consider the entire path the robot can take, not just a single cell.

For the robot to reach (2, n), it must be able to move to the last column of the second row. This means that at some point, the robot must be able to move to the second row and then move right until it reaches the last column. The robot can move to the second row from the first row if there is an arrow pointing down in the first row or an arrow pointing up in the second row. Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move right until it reaches the last column.

The provided solution does not account for these conditions. It only checks the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row, which is not sufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach (2, n).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
