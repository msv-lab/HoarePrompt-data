Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    flag = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
        if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        print(count + 1)
    else:
        print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where adjacent characters are different. If `flag` is 0, indicating there is no position in `s` where a '0' is followed by a '1', then `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, indicating there is at least one position in `s` where a '0' is followed by a '1', then `flag` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `count` is the number of positions where the integer value of `s[i]` is not equal to the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t`, and `t` remains the same. If `flag` is 0, it indicates that there does not exist any position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`. If `flag` is 1, it indicates that there exists at least one position where the integer value of `s[i]` is less than the integer value of `s[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where the character at position `i` is different from the character at position `i + 1`. If `flag` is 0, `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, `flag` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
