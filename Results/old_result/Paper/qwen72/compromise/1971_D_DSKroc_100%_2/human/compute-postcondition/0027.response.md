Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length 1 to 500, `i` is `len(s) - 2`, and `count` is the number of positions in `s` where adjacent characters are different. If `flag` is 0, indicating there is no position in `s` where a '0' is followed by a '1', then `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 1, indicating there is at least one position in `s` where a '0' is followed by a '1', then `flag` remains 1.***
