Postcondition: ***`s` is an input binary string of length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is `t + 1`, `t` remains the same, `flag` is 1 if the first character of `s` is less than the second character, otherwise `flag` is 0, and `count` is 2 if the second and third characters of `s` are different, otherwise `count` is 1. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, `flag` is set to 1.***
