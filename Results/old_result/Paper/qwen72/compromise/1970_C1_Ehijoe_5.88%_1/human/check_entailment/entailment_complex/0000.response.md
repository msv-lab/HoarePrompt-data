Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` should accept parameters `n` and `u_1` as described in the problem statement. However, the function does not take any parameters and instead reads input directly within the function. This is a deviation from the expected behavior, but for the purpose of this problem, it does not affect the correctness since `t` is always 1 and the input handling is consistent with the problem's constraints.

2. **Tree Construction**:
   - The function constructs the tree using a deque. The conditions in the loop correctly handle the edges to build the tree in a linear fashion, which is appropriate given that the tree has exactly two leaves and can be treated as an array-like structure.

3. **Start Node and Index Calculation**:
   - The function reads the starting node `start` and finds its index in the deque `tree`. This is correct and necessary for determining the number of moves.

4. **Move Calculation**:
   - The function calculates two potential moves: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. Since `t` is always 1, these calculations simplify to `idx` and `n - idx - 1`, which represent the number of moves to the left and right from the starting node, respectively.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The function checks if either of the moves is an odd number. If so, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. This logic is based on the fact that if the number of moves is odd, Ron will make the last move and win. If the number of moves is even, Hermione will make the last move and win.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the starting node is one of the leaves. In such cases, the number of moves to one side will be 0, and the other side will be `n - 1`, which is always even for `n > 2`.

7. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the function aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided. The function correctly determines the winner based on the number of moves available.

Given the above reasoning, the function is correct in its implementation and logic.

Correctness: **True**
