Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
   - `tree` is a deque containing integers that were appended based on conditions in a loop.
   - `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True.
   - `start` is an input integer.
   - `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised.
   - `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
   - All elements in `moves` are even.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Hermione')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Hermione'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal `'Hermione'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
