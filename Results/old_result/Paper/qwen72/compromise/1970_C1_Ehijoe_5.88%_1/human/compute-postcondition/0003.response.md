To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

The other variables (`t`, `func_1`, `tree`, `empty`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly. However, since the problem statement mentions that `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem, this is a note for the programmer to address, but it does not impact the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `t` and `func_1` remain as provided, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True**
