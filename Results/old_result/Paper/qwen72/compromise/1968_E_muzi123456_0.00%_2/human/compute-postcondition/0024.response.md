The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 3**
