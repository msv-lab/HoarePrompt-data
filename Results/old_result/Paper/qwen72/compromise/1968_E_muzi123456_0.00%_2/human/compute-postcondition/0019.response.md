The `print` statement in the given code snippet will print the string `'1'` and will not move to a new line after printing because the `end=' '` parameter is used, which specifies that a space should be used as the end character instead of a newline.

- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string "1" followed by a space)
