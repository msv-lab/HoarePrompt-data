Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

The `print` statement will output the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly defined as 1.

Output: **1**
