The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: The initial state describes the values of `t`, `n`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- **Print Statement**: The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` and setting the `end` parameter to `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line, followed by a space.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
