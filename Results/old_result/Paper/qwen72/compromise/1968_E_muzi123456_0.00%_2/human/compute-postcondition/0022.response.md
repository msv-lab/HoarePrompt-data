The given `print` statement is:
```
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as the first argument.
   - The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, a space will be printed instead of a newline.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print` function will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **

Explanation: The `print` statement will print the number `1` followed by a space. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
