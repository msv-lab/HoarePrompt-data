The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 2**
