The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3) and prints a sequence of lines. Each line consists of the string '1' followed by an integer from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is 0, and the final state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding sequences have been printed.
