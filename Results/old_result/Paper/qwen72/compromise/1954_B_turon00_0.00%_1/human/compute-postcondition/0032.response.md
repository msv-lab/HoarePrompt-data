Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
