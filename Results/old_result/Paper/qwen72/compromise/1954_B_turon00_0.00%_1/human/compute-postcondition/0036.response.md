Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
5. `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`.
6. `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`.
7. `i` is `n-1`.
8. `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the new `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the new `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
9. `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state and the variables described in it do not affect the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
