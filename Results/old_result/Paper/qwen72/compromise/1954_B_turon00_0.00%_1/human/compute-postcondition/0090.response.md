The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns the result based on the input parameters and the constraints provided. Since the output is not explicitly described, we can infer the following cases based on typical problem-solving patterns:

Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input for `t`.
Case_2: If `n` is outside the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input for `n`.
Case_3: If any element `a_i` in the list `a` is outside the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input for `a`.
Case_4: If the array `a` is valid and beautiful, the function returns a result based on the properties of the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function operates with an implicit input of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and a list of integers `a` of length n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns an error message if `t` or `n` are out of their valid ranges, or if any element in `a` is out of its valid range. If the inputs are valid, the function returns a result based on the properties of the beautiful array `a`.**
