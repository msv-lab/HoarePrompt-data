Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
