Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.***
