The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. If all elements in `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where all elements are equal to the first element of `a` and prints this minimum length. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `_` being `t-1`, `n` and `a` being the values from the last test case, `tmp` being the first element of the last `a`, `aa` being a set of the unique elements of the last `a`, `i` being `n-1`, `cnt` being the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the last `a`, and `ans` being the minimum value between the initial `n` and the maximum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the last `a`.
