#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, converting it into integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers converted from the input provided by the user, where the input is split into separate values based on spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into separate values based on spaces, converts each value into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any parameters. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, so there are no variables to describe in the precondition.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact content of the list, but it will be whatever `func_1()` returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The exact content of the list is determined by the output of `func_1()`, which is not defined in the provided code.
