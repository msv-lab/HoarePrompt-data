Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input arguments, but the provided function definition does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.**

However, based on the problem description, the precondition for the inputs when the function is correctly defined should be:

- **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
- **Each test case contains:**
  - **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.**
  - **a is a list of n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**
- **The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
