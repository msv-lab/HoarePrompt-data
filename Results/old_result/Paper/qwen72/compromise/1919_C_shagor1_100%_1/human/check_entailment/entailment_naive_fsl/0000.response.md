Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 2 3 4
```

The optimal split to minimize the penalty would be `s = [1, 2, 2, 3]` and `t = [4]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 0 = 2`. However, the program will output `1` because it does not properly account for the duplicate elements and their impact on the penalty calculation.

The logic in the program updates `la` and `lb` in a way that does not guarantee the optimal split. Specifically, the condition `elif i <= lb:` can lead to incorrect updates when there are duplicate elements, causing the penalty to be miscalculated.
