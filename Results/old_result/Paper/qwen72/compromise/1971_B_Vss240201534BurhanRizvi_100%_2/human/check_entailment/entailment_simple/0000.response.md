### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single-character string to be different.
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., the set of characters in `s` has a length of 1 and `s` has more than one character), the program correctly prints "No" because any rearrangement will still result in the same string.

3. **Shuffling:**
   - The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of `s` and create a new string `s2`.
   - If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as the original string `s`, the program manually rearranges `s` by moving the first character to the end, ensuring that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` if the conditions for rearrangement are met.
   - The program correctly handles the output format as specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle all the specified edge cases and the main logic for rearranging the string. The use of `random.sample` and the manual rearrangement in case of a match ensures that the output string is different from the input string when possible. The output format is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

**Correctness: True**
