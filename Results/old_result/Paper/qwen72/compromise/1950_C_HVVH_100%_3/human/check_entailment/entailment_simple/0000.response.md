Reasoning:  
The provided function `func()` is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print the results. Let's break down the function to evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading a time string in the format "hh:mm" for each test case. This is correct based on the problem description.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it is converted to 12 and the day part is set to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it is reduced by 12 and the day part is set to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format correspond to 01 to 11 PM in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is 12, the day part is set to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - For all other hours (1 to 11), the day part is set to 'AM'. This is correct because these hours correspond to 01 to 11 AM in 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting**: The function prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using an f-string. The `:02d` format specifier ensures that the hour and minute are always two digits, which is correct based on the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 0, converting it to 12 and setting the day part to 'AM'.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 12, keeping it as 12 and setting the day part to 'PM'.
   - The function correctly handles the transition from AM to PM at 12:00.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to handle all the required cases and edge cases correctly, and it follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
