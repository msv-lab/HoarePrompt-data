Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `n` times, reading a time string in the format "hh:mm" for each test case.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it correctly converts it to 12 and sets `day` to 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it correctly converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it correctly sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - For all other hours (1 to 11), it correctly sets `day` to 'AM'.

3. **Output Formatting**: The function uses Python's f-string formatting to ensure that the hour and minute are always two digits, and it correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conversion logic.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 00, converting it to 12:00 AM.
   - It also correctly handles the edge case where the hour is 12, converting it to 12:00 PM.
   - The function correctly handles the transition from 11:59 AM to 12:00 PM and from 11:59 PM to 12:00 AM.

5. **Overall Logic**: The logic for converting the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format is correct and follows the problem description.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
