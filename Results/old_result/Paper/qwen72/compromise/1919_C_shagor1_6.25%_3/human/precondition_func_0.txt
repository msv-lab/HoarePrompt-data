The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but the function definition is incomplete. The input parameters should include a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list, and the function should handle multiple test cases, so an additional integer `t` representing the number of test cases should also be included. Each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the size of `a` is 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
