The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then calculates the number of elements in `a` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
