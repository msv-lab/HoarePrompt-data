The function `func` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each element in `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the size of `a` is 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the processing of one test case.
