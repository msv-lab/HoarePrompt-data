Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `x` is equal to `a`, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `ans` is 0, and `y` remains `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 1.**
