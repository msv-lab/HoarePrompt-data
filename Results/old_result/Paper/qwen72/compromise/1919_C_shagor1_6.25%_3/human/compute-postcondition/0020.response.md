Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1` if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `y` is the second element in the list `inp`. `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. `ans` is 0 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x` or if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`. `ans` is 1 if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`. `x == y` is evaluated to a boolean value.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x == y` evaluates the equality of `x` and `y` and does not change their values.
- The value of `ans` remains 0 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x` or if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`.
- The value of `ans` remains 1 if the second element in `inp` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, `y`, `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
