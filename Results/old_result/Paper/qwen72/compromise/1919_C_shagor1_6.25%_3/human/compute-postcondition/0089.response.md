Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is smaller), `y` is the second element in `inp`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to be the second element in the list `inp`, which is `a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, `a`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
