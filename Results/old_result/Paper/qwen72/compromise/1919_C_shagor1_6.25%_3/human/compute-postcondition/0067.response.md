Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 2` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the third element in `inp`, and `ans` is 0 (or 1, depending on the condition in the previous iteration). If `a` ≤ `x`, `ans` remains 0 (or 1, depending on the condition in the previous iteration). Otherwise, `ans` is 1 (or 2, depending on the condition in the previous iteration).***
