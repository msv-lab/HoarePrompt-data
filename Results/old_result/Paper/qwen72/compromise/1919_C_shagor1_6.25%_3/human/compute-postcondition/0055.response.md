Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `ans` is 0, `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a` and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `x` is `n + 1`.
- The initial state also specifies that `a` is the second element in `inp`.
- If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `y` remains `n + 1`.
- If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.
- The comparison `x == y` does not change any variables but is used to check if `x` and `y` are equal.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a` remains the second element in `inp`.
- The value of `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise it is 1.
- The value of `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise it is `a`.
