Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `a` is the third element in the list `inp`, `x` is set to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is set to `n + 1`, `y` is set to `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `x == y` is False if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, otherwise `x == y` is True.**
