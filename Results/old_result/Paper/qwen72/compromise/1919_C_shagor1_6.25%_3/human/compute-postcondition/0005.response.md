The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `inp`, so we can only adjust those.

For the loop to execute, the list `inp` must have at least one element. The variable `a` will take the value of the first element in the list `inp` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`**
