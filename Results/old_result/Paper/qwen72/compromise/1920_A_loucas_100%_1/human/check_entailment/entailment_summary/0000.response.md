Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Constraint Categorization**: The program categorizes the constraints into three lists:
   - `big` for constraints where `k` must be greater than or equal to `x` (type 1).
   - `less` for constraints where `k` must be less than or equal to `x` (type 2).
   - `no` for constraints where `k` must not be equal to `x` (type 3).

3. **Range Calculation**: The program calculates the range of valid `k` values using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This correctly identifies the range of integers that satisfy both the "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints.

4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**: The program iterates over the `no` list and subtracts 1 from `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This ensures that any forbidden values are excluded from the count of valid `k` values.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case. If no valid solutions exist, it prints 0, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
