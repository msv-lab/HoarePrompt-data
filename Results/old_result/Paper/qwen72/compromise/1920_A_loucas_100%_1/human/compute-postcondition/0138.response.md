Output State: **`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, and the current value of `num` is less than 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
