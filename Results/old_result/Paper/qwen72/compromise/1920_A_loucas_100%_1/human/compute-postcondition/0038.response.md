Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and `num` is less than 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big`, `less`, and `no` are lists containing values of `a` based on the corresponding values of `x` from each iteration. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
