Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` == 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `less` is a list, and `no` is a list. If `x` == 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are unchanged. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing `a`, and the lists `big` and `less` are determined based on the new value of `x`.***
