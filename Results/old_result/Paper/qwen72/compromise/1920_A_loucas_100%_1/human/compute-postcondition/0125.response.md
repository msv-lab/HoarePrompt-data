Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are the new integers provided by user input, `big` is an empty list if `x` is not 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `less` is a list containing `[a, a]` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is a list containing `[a]`, `no` is a list containing `[a, a]` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 1.***
