Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the values of `a` appended based on the corresponding values of `x` from each iteration. Specifically, if `x` was 1 in any iteration, the value of `a` from that iteration is appended to `big`. If `x` was 2, the value of `a` is appended to `less`. If `x` was anything other than 1 or 2, the value of `a` is appended to `no`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain the values of `a` based on the corresponding values of `x` from each iteration. For each iteration:
  - If `x` was 1, the value of `a` is appended to `big`.
  - If `x` was 2, the value of `a` is appended to `less`.
  - If `x` was anything other than 1 or 2, the value of `a` is appended to `no`.
- All other variables (`t`, `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
