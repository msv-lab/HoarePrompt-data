Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer provided by user input, `a` is the second integer provided by user input, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` must be greater than 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is `[a, a]`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is `[a, a]`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is `[a, a]`.***
