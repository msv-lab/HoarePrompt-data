Postcondition: **`iterable` is `loop`, `loop` remains unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the last integers provided by user input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
