Postcondition: ***`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is 0, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number or is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.***
