Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, and `best` is the maximum representable floating-point number.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is -1, `total` is updated based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and the new `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the original `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[0] < custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` and `best` remains the same. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is used, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` if `custo_pra_passar_b[0]` is used.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is 0, and `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number or is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
