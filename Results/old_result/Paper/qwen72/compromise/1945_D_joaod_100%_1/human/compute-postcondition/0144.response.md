Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from input. For each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to `pos_final` by either swapping elements or passing through them, and prints the best (minimum) cost found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remaining unchanged, and the calculated best cost for each test case being printed. **
