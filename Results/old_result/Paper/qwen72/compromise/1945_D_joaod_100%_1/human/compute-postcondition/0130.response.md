The only objects in the loop head are `v` and `na_frente`. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1. At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is 0, and `na_frente` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the sequence, which is -1. However, the loop condition is that `v` must be greater than or equal to -1 for the loop to continue. Since `v` is already 0, and the loop is decrementing `v`, the next value of `v` will be -1, which is still within the valid range for the loop to execute.

However, since `v` is already at the lower bound of the loop range (0), and the loop is decrementing `v`, the loop will not execute again because `v` will become -1, which is less than -1, violating the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will not actually occur) would be:
State: **`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is -1, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]` from the previous iteration, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number or is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.**

But since the loop will not execute again, the actual state remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`na_frente` is at least 1, `v` is 0, `total` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]` from the previous iteration, `best` remains the maximum representable floating-point number or is updated to the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]` based on the previous iteration.**
