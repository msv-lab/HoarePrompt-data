To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is -1.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input.

2. **Computation of `total`:**
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value -1) to 0.
   - Since `na_frente` is -1 and the range is from -1 to 0, this means we are summing the minimum values for `v = -1` and `v = 0`.
   - However, `v = -1` is out of bounds for the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` unless they have at least one element. If they have at least one element, `v = -1` refers to the last element of the list, and `v = 0` refers to the first element of the list.
   - Therefore, `total` is the sum of the minimum values of the last element and the first element of the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

3. **Computation of `best`:**
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value -1) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - Since `na_frente` is -1 and `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, we need to consider the range from -1 to 0, but only if these values are less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - If `pos_final` is 0 or greater, then the range is valid and we need to compute `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for `v = -1` and `v = 0`.
   - If `pos_final` is less than -1, then the range is invalid, and `best` would be undefined or not computed.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Given the initial state and the computation, the `print(best)` statement will output the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for `v = -1` and `v = 0`, provided these values are within the valid range (less than or equal to `pos_final`).

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these lists.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for `v = -1` and `v = 0` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum values of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for `v = -1` and `v = 0`)**
