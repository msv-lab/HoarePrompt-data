Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost by iterating from the end of the queue to the beginning. However, the logic used to update the `best` variable and the `total` cost is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly consider the cost of moving Kirill to a position `j` where `j < i` and the additional costs for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Handling of `best` Variable**:
   - The `best` variable is supposed to track the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people. However, the program updates `best` only when `v <= pos_final`, which is not the correct approach.
   - The program should consider all possible positions `j` where Kirill can move and calculate the total cost for each of these positions, then choose the minimum.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly adds the cost of moving to a position `v` to the `total` cost. It should instead calculate the cost of moving to a position `j` and the additional costs for each `k` between `j` and `i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `m = n` or when `m = 1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a priority queue, to keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to any position within the first `m` people. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import heapq

def min_coins_to_move(cases):
    for _ in range(cases):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Kirill starts at position n, so we need to move him to position m-1 or less
        n -= 1
        m -= 1
        
        # Initialize the total cost and a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to move
        total = 0
        heap = []
        
        # Iterate from the end to the beginning
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            if i <= m:
                # If we are within the first m positions, we need to consider the cost to move to this position
                if heap:
                    max_cost = heapq.heappop(heap)
                    total += max_cost
                total += a[i]
            else:
                # If we are outside the first m positions, add the cost to the heap
                heapq.heappush(heap, -b[i])
        
        print(total)

# Read the number of test cases
cases = int(input())
min_coins_to_move(cases)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Heap**: We use a min-heap to keep track of the maximum `b_k` values that Kirill has to pay if he moves past them.
- **Total Cost**: We initialize the total cost to 0 and iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - If the current position `i` is within the first `m` positions, we add the cost `a_i` to the total and also add the maximum cost from the heap (if it exists) to the total.
  - If the current position `i` is outside the first `m` positions, we add the negative of `b_i` to the heap (since we are using a min-heap to keep track of the maximum values).

This approach ensures that Kirill moves to the optimal position within the first `m` people with the minimum cost.
