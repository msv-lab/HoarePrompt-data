Output State: **The loop iterates over the number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. After processing, the loop prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in `b` is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations.**
