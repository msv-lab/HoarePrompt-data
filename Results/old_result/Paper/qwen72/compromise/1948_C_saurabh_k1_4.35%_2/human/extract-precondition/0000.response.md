Precondition: **The function should accept three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. Each string consists only of the characters '<' and '>', and n is even. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def can_reach_end(t, n_list, grid_list):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n_list is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even, and grid_list is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, each string consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. The sum of all n values in n_list does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
