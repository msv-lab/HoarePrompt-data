You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each integer 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two lists of strings row1 and row2 (each string of length n and consisting of characters '<' and '>'). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer greater than 1, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, `k` and `no_path` remain unchanged. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, if all characters at odd indices in `a` (from 1 to `k`) are '>', `no_path` becomes True.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a list of even integers representing the lengths of the strings in `row1` and `row2`), and `row1` and `row2` (two lists of strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'). For each test case, it returns "Yes" if the characters in `row1` and `row2` can be paired such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa; otherwise, it returns "No".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
