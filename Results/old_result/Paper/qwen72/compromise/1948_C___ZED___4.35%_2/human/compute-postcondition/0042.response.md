Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>'.
   - `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, then `k` is the last odd index less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is initially False.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `no_path` is initially False, then `k` is the last odd index less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index from 1 to `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.
   - If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True.
   - Additionally, `no_path` is False.

3. **Final State**:
   - Given that `no_path` is initially False and the additional condition states that `no_path` is False, `no_path` remains False regardless of the other conditions.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NO')`, it will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
