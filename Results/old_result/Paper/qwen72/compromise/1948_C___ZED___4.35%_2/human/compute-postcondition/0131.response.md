The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and two lists `row1` and `row2`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a list of integers where each integer is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of the strings in `row1` and `row2`.
- `row1` and `row2` are lists of strings, each string of length `n` and consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the characters in `row1` and `row2` can be paired such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa. If such a pairing is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a list of even integers representing the lengths of the strings in `row1` and `row2`), and `row1` and `row2` (two lists of strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'). For each test case, it returns "Yes" if the characters in `row1` and `row2` can be paired such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa; otherwise, it returns "No".**
