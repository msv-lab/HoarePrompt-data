Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters but reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the characters in `a` and `b` can be paired such that each '<' in `a` is paired with a '>' in `b` and vice versa. It prints "YES" if the pairing is possible, and "NO" otherwise. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a "YES" or "NO" result has been printed. **
