Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False and any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is initially True, it remains True.***
