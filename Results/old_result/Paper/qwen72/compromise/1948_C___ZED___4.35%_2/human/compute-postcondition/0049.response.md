Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is the last even index less than `n` if the second-to-last character of the new `b` is `>` and `n` is greater than 1, or the last odd index less than `n` if `no_path` is initially False and `n` is greater than 1, `no_path` is either True or False based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to a new input string.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is determined based on the new value of `b` and the initial value of `no_path`.
- The value of `no_path` remains as it was initially, either True or False.
