The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `no_path`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **NO**
