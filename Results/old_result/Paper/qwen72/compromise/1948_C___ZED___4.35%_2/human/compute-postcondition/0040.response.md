Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>'.
   - `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, then `k` is the last odd index less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is initially True.
   - If any character at an odd index from 1 to `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.
   - The current value of `no_path` is True.

2. **Conditions:**
   - Since `no_path` is True, `k` must be the last even index less than `n`.
   - For `no_path` to remain True, all characters at odd indices from 1 to `k` in `a` must be '>'.
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given that `no_path` is True, it means that all the conditions have been met:
- `k` is the last even index less than `n`.
- All characters at odd indices from 1 to `k` in `a` are '>', ensuring that `no_path` remains True.

Since `no_path` is True, the print statement `print('YES')` will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
