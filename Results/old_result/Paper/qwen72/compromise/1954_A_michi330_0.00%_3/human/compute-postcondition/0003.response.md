The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from `stdin`. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50). After processing each test case, the function returns a result for each case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from `stdin`. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function returns a result for each test case.**
