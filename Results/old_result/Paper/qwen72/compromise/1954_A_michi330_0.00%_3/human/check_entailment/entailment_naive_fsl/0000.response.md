Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `k` and `m` is greater than 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is equal to `k` and `m` is greater than 1, Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. For example, if `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 5`, Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. Bob can repaint at most 5 parts, but he cannot make all parts the same color without changing the color of all parts, which is not allowed since he can only choose one color. However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' in this case.
