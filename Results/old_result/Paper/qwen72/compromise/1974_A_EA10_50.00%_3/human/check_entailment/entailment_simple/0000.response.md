### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `x` and `y` which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula is used to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons, this calculation ensures that we have enough screens to accommodate all 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula calculates the total number of cells available on `z` screens and subtracts the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`. If it is, it calculates the additional number of screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula ensures that we account for any remaining 1x1 icons that cannot fit into the current screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens `z` required for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Variable `a` vs. `t`**: The variable `a` is used to store the number of test cases, but the problem description mentions `t`. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is inconsistent with the problem statement.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**:
  - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, but this is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `15 * z - 4 * y` to ensure that we are correctly subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
- **Incorrect Condition for Additional Screens**:
  - The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. It should be `if m < x:` to check if the remaining space is less than the number of 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - 4 * y
        
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15
        
        print(z)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
- **False**: The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
