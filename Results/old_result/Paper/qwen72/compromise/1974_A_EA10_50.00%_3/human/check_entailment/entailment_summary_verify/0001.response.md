### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`, and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`. This is correct because it rounds up the division of `y` by 2, ensuring that we use the minimum number of screens to place all the 2x2 icons. For example, if `y = 3`, we need 2 screens to place all 3 icons (since 1 screen can hold 2 icons, and the third icon requires an additional screen).

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`. This is correct because it determines the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, `15 * z` gives the total number of cells available on `z` screens, and `y * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. The remaining space `m` is then `15 * z - y * 4`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if `m` (remaining space) is less than `x` (number of 1x1 icons). If `m` is less than `x`, it means there are not enough cells left to place all the 1x1 icons, so additional screens are needed.
   - The formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is used to calculate the number of additional screens required. This formula is correct because it rounds up the division of the remaining 1x1 icons by the number of cells per screen (15). For example, if `x - m = 16`, we need 2 additional screens (since 16 / 15 = 1.0667, which rounds up to 2).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required, `z`. This is the final result for each test case.

### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - `m < x` is `11 < 1` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - `m < x` is `7 < 7` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 14`
  - `m < x` is `14 < 12` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - `m < x` is `18 < 0` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `m < x` is `0 < 1` (True), so additional screens are needed.
  - `z = 0 + (1 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `x = 8`, `y = 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - `m < x` is `11 < 8` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `m < x` is `0 < 0` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 8**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `m < x` is `0 < 2` (True), so additional screens are needed.
  - `z = 0 + (2 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 9**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `m < x` is `0 < 15` (True), so additional screens are needed.
  - `z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 10**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - `m < x` is `7 < 8` (True), so additional screens are needed.
  - `z = 1 + (8 - 7 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 11**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
  - `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`
  - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 15`
  - `m < x` is `15 < 0` (False), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `5` (Correct)
