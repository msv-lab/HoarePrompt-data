The function `func_4` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided output cases, it seems to operate with two integer values `n` and `k` that are defined within the function. The constraints for these values are 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.

Output:
- Case_1: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_2: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_3: The function returns the integer values of `n` and `k`, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`. In both cases, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function returns (0, 0) in the first two cases. In the third case, it returns the integer values of `n` and `k` where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is between 0 and 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n^2 - 1) // 2; if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`. The function ensures that `max_k` is always greater than or equal to `k`.**
