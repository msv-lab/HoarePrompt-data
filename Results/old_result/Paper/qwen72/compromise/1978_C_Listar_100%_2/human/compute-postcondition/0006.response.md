The code snippet `func_5(l)` calls the function `func_5` with the argument `l`, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `n` is not equal to 0. The value of `l` is determined by the function `func_1(n, k)`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_5` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact output or side effects of this function. However, we know that `func_5` is called with `l` as its argument. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the value of `l` is still the result of `func_1(n, k)`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `n` is not equal to 0. `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. `func_5` has been called with `l` as its argument.**
