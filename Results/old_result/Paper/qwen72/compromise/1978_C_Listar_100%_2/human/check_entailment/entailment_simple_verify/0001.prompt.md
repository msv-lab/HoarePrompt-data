You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even (since each term `|p_i - i|` is an integer, and the sum of integers is even if the number of terms is even).
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. For an even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`, and for an odd `n`, it is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function is responsible for generating a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It starts by dividing `k` by 2, which is a valid step because `k` is always even.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, which means it processes the list in pairs of elements.
   - For each pair, it checks if `k` is zero. If so, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` is less than the current pair index minus 1, it calls `func_2` to swap elements and reduce `k`.
   - Otherwise, it reduces `k` by the current pair index minus 1 and calls `func_3` to swap elements.
   - The function continues until `k` is zero or the list is fully processed.

3. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps `l[-c]` and `l[-c - k]` where `c` is the current pair index and `k` is the remaining value to be reduced.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

4. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps `l[c - 1]` and `l[-c]` where `c` is the current pair index.
   - It returns the modified list `l`.

5. **Function 5 (func_5):**
   - This function prints the result if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.

6. **Function 6 (func_6):**
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_4` to read and validate the input.
   - If `n` is zero (indicating an invalid input), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Validation:**
  - The program correctly checks if `k` is odd and if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Permutation Generation:**
  - The program attempts to generate a permutation by swapping elements in a systematic way to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
  - The logic in `func_1` and the helper functions `func_2` and `func_3` is designed to reduce `k` by the correct amount while maintaining the permutation properties.
- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints "NO" if no valid permutation exists and "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and generate valid permutations when possible. The logic for generating permutations and the input validation are sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
