### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Constraints:**
   - The function `func_4` correctly checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. This is a valid way to handle the case where `k` is odd because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even. Therefore, if `k` is odd, no permutation can satisfy the condition.
   - The function `func_4` also correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, which is correct because no permutation can achieve a higher Manhattan value than `max_k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by iteratively reducing `k` and swapping elements in the list `l`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed in the following ways:
     - The loop `for i in range(n, -1, -2)` iterates from `n` to `0` in steps of `-2`. This means it will iterate `n // 2 + 1` times if `n` is odd, and `n // 2` times if `n` is even.
     - The variable `c` is incremented in each iteration, which is used to determine the positions of elements to swap.
     - The condition `if k < i - 1` is used to call `func_2` to swap elements. However, this condition does not always ensure that the resulting permutation will have the correct Manhattan value.
     - The function `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c-1` and `-c`, which is intended to increment the Manhattan value by `i - 1`. However, this logic is not always correct, especially when `k` is not a multiple of `i - 1`.

3. **Specific Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the input `n = 4` and `k = 5`:
     - `func_4` correctly identifies that `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)`.
     - `func_6` then prints "No" and returns, which is the correct behavior for this input.

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - However, the permutation construction logic in `func_1` and `func_3` is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly. For example, if `k` is a large even number but not a multiple of the step sizes used in the loop, the program may produce an incorrect permutation or fail to produce any permutation at all.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in the permutation construction logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
