The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' characters, and a positive integer `n` within the range 1 to 5 * 10^5. It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element `ans[i]` is determined based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `s1` remains unchanged, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, and `suffZero` is a list of length `n + 1` containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
