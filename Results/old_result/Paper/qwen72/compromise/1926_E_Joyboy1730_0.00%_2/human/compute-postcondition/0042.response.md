The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations + 1, `a` is the last element in the list `L` (which is undefined since `L` is empty)**
