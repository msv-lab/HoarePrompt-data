Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `a` is undefined since `L` is empty.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - m`.
- Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- All other variables (`L`, `t`, `k`, `_`, `tot`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
