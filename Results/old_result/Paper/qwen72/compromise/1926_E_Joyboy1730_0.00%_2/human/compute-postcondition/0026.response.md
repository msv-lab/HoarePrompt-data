Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - a`, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `a` is the second element in the list `L`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
