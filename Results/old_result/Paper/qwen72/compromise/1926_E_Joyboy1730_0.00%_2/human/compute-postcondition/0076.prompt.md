Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `L` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot` after the last iteration, `_` is a placeholder variable, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `a` is undefined since `L` is empty, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
        break
    tot += a
    k -= tot
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a`, `k` is `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is `pow * 2`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `L`, `a`, or the updated `tot`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `L` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a`, `k` is `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is `pow * 2`, and if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `L` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `tot` is `tot + a` (from the current iteration), `k` is `k - (tot + a)` (from the last iteration) and then `k -= tot` (from the current iteration), `pow` is `pow * 2` (from the last iteration) and now `pow` is `pow * 2` (from the current iteration). If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
