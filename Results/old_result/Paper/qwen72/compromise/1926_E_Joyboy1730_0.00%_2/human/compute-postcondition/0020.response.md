Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is the first element in the list `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
