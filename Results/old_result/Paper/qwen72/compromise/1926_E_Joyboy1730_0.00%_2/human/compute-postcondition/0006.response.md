The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**
