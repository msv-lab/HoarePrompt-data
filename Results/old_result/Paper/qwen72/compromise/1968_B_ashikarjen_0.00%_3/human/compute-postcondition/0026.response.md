Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`, and `j` is equal to `m`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is never equal to `a[1]` for any `j` less than `m`, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `m`. At this point, the condition `j < m` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate with `j` equal to `m`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the initial conditions for `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.
