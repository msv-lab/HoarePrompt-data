Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are not equal to `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, `j` remains `m` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
