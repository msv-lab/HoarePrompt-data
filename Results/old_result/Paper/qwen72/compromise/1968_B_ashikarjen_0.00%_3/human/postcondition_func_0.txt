The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. It then counts the number of matches (`k`) between characters in `a` and `b` by iterating through `a` and finding corresponding characters in `b`. The function prints the count `k` of matches found. The function does not return any value, and it processes one test case at a time. The state after the function concludes is that the input has been consumed, and the count of matches `k` has been printed.
