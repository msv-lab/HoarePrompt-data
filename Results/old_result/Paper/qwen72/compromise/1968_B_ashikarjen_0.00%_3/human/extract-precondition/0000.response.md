Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of test cases and the test cases themselves. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m, respectively. The integers n and m satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the total sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The binary strings a and b consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `(n, m, a, b)`.
