Reasoning:  
The program is designed to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given \( a \times b \) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then reassembling them. The key logic in the program is to check if either dimension \( a \) or \( b \) is even. If one of the dimensions is even, it can be cut into two equal parts, and if these parts can form a new rectangle that is different from the original, the program should output "Yes". Otherwise, it should output "No".

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Even Dimension Check**: It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even.
3. **Rectangle Formation Check**:
   - If \( a \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - It then checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \) is not equal to \( b \). If true, it prints "Yes" because the new rectangle \( \left(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\right) \) is different from the original \( a \times b \).
   - Similarly, if \( b \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - It then checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \) is not equal to \( a \). If true, it prints "Yes" because the new rectangle \( \left(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\right) \) is different from the original \( a \times b \).
4. **Output "No"**: If neither dimension is even, or if the resulting halves form the same rectangle as the original, it prints "No".

The logic is correct because:
- If \( a \) or \( b \) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two equal parts.
- If these parts can form a new rectangle that is different from the original, Bob can achieve his goal.
- The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as when both dimensions are odd or when the halves form the same rectangle.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
