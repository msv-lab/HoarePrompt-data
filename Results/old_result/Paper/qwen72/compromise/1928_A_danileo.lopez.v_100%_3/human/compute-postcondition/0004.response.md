Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from user input. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, and if so, it prints 'Yes'. If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, and if so, it prints 'Yes'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. **
