### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` and prints the result.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1(s)` is defined to take a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. The initial balance is set to 0.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The dictionary `d` is updated with the balance at each position.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - The program removes the last element from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the sorting step.
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order and, for ties, by the position (`x[0]`) in decreasing order.
   - This step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the input string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and returns the reversed string of `s`. This is incorrect. The function does not return the reversed string; it returns the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Analysis:
- **Balance Calculation:**
  - The balance is correctly calculated for each prefix of the string.
  - The dictionary `d` stores the balance at each position, which is necessary for the balanced shuffle operation.

- **Sorting:**
  - The sorting step is crucial. The program sorts the dictionary items by balance in increasing order and, for ties, by position in decreasing order.
  - This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The program constructs the result string by appending characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Dictionary Initialization:**
  - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct for the balance at the start of the string.
  - However, the dictionary should be initialized with `d[0] = 0` and then updated for each position from 1 to n-1. The program correctly updates the balance for each position.

- **Dictionary Removal:**
  - The program removes the last element from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the sorting step.
  - This step is correct and necessary.

- **Character Appending:**
  - The program appends characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance, sorts the positions, and constructs the result string accordingly. The function summary provided is incorrect, but the program itself is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
