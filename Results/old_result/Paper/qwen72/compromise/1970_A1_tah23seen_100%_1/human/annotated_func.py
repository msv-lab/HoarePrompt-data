#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000.

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at position `i` in `s`, starting from 0. The final value of `d[n]` is 0, indicating that the sequence is balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a reversed string of `s`, and `d` remains the same sorted list of tuples.
    return ans
    #The program returns the reversed string of `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and returns the reversed string of `s`.
