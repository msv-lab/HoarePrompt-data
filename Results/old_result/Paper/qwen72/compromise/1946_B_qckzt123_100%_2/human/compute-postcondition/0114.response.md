The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `k`, or `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `k` must be at least 2
- `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`
- `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is now the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`, which is the same as the initial value of `ans` since `ans` was already the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, `t` is the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.**
