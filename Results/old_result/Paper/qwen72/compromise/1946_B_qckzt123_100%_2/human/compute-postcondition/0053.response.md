The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `tmp` is either 0 or the first element in the list `a` (if the first element is non-negative), `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.**
