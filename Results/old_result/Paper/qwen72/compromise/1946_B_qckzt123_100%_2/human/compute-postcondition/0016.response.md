Postcondition: ***`t` is the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative), `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the sum of the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative) and the second element in the list `a`.***
