Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is 0, `_` is 0, `T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is 0 if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as `x`, `_` is 0, `T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is the maximum of `0` and `tmp`, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is `0` if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `_` is `0`, `T` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is the maximum of `0` and `tmp`, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp` is `0` if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `_` is `0`, `T` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
