The value of `t` is updated to be twice its original value, and then `t` is set to the remainder of `t * 2` divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`**
