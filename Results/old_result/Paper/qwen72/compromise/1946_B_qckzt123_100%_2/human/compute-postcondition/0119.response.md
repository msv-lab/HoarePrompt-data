The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `k`, or `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `k` must be at least 3
- `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`
- `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`, which is the same as the current value of `ans` since `ans` was already the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state remains:
- `i` is 2
- `k` must be at least 3
- `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`
- `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `t` is the remainder of `t * 4` divided by `MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`**
