To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given:
- `i` is `k-2`
- `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations

For the loop to execute at least once, `k - 1` must be greater than 0. This means `k` must be at least 1. However, since `i` is initialized to `k-2`, for the loop to start, `i` should be less than `k-1`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 to ensure `i` starts at 0 (or a valid starting point for the range).

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be 0 (the starting point of the loop)
- `k` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be at least 2**
