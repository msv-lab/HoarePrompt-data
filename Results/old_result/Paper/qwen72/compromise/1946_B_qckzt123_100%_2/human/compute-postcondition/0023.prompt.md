Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is assigned the value of `t` and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now 0, `tmp` is now 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative), `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `tmp` is the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative), `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the second element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the sum of the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative) and the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative), `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`. If `tmp` < 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
