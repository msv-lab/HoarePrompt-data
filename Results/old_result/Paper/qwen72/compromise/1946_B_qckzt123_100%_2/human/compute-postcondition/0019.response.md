The code snippet `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding the value of `x` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative).
- `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 3 elements.
- `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `x` is the third element in the list `a`.
- If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the sum of the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative) and the second element in the list `a`.

After executing `tmp += x`, the value of `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`.

Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the first element in the list `a` (or 0 if the first element was negative), `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is now `tmp + x`.**
