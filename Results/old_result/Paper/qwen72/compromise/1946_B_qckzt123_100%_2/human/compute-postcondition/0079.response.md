The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `k`, or `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `k` is greater than 2
- `t` is `4 * t % MOD`
- `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ans` is updated to be the remainder of `ans` divided by `MOD`, which is already the case since `ans` was previously set to the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is `4 * t % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.**
