The value of `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` to it. Since `t` is defined as `4 * t % MOD`, its value is already computed modulo `MOD`. After adding `t` to `ans`, `ans` will also be the remainder of the new sum when divided by `MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `t` is `4 * t % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`ans` + `t`) divided by `MOD`.**
