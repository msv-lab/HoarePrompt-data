The code reads a line from standard input, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k` after converting them to integers.

Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `t * (2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input.**
