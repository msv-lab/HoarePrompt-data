Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count` and subsequently what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of characters from an input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- The length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `k` is 1.

### Conditions:
- If `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
- Otherwise, `count` is 0.
- Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the values of `j` and `k`**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `k` is 1.

2. **Determine the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`**:
   - `s[k]` is the second element of the list `s`.
   - `s[k + j]` is `s[1 + 0]`, which is also the second element of the list `s`.

3. **Check the conditions**:
   - The condition states that if `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - Since `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are the same element (both are `s[1]`), the condition `s[k] == s[k + j]` will always be true.
   - Therefore, `count` will always be 2.

4. **Calculate the output**:
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 2, `count * 2` will be `2 * 2`, which is 4.

### Final Output:
Output: **4**
