Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. It checks for the presence of consecutive pairs of characters in `s` that either contain a question mark or are equal. If such a sequence of pairs is found where the length of the sequence is at least half the length of `s`, the function prints the length of the sequence multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such sequence is found, the function prints 0 and returns. The function does not return any value explicitly. **
