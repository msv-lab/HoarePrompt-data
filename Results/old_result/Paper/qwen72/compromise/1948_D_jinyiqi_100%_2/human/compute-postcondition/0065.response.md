Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from an input string, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - The length of the input string (and thus the list `s`) is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - `count` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `count` is given as 1.
   - The `print` statement multiplies `count` by 2 and prints the result.
   - Since `count` is 1, `count * 2` will be 2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `count * 2`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
