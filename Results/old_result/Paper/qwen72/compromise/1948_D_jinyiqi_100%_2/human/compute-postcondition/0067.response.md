Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
