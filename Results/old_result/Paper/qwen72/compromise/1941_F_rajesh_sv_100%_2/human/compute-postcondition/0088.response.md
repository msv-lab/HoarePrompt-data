Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `l` and `h` converge to the same index, which is `mid`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the first value in `F`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state. If `l` is equal to `h`, the above conditions are met.***
