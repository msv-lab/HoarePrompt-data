Postcondition: **The loop has finished executing, and `l` is equal to `h`. The variable `mid` is the final index where `l` and `h` converge, and `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`. The variable `ans` remains equal to `max_diff`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `f`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state. Additionally, `l` is equal to `h`.**
