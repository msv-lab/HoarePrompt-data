To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `l < h`. This condition must be true for the loop to start.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`
- `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations
- `i` is `n-1`
- `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`
- `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9
- `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` must have at least one element
- `f` is the first element in `F`
- `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs
- `left` is `A[index - 1]`
- `right` is `A[index]`
- `ans` is equal to `max_diff`
- `l` is the index in `D` where the first element greater than `left - f` is found
- `h` is the index in `D` where the first element greater than or equal to `right - f` is found minus 1

The condition `l < h` depends on the values of `l` and `h`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `l` and `h` are derived from the list `D`, we need to ensure that there are elements in `D` such that `l` and `h` can satisfy this condition.

Given the definitions:
- `l` is the index in `D` where the first element greater than `left - f` is found.
- `h` is the index in `D` where the first element greater than or equal to `right - f` is found minus 1.

For `l < h` to be true, there must be at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f` (exclusive). This means that `D` must have at least two elements, and the difference between `right - f` and `left - f` must be large enough to contain at least one element in `D`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `l` is less than `h`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `D` has at least two elements and that `right - f` is greater than `left - f`.
