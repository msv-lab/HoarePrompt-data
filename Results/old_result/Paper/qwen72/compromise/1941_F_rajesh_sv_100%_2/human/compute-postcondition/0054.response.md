Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i] < A[i+1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()` with at least two elements, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, and `F` must have at least one element, `f` is the first element in `F`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `right - f` is greater than `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`.**
