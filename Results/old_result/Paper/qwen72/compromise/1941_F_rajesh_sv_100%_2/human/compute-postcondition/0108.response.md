Output State: **`total` is 0, `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second value in `F`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, and the other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state.**

The code snippet updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. The values of `total`, `l`, `h`, `mid`, `ans`, `f`, and `l` remain unchanged. The other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) also retain their initial values.
