t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9, f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
