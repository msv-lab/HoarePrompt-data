Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. `results` is an empty list. `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`).**
