The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions a parameter constraint for `n` (an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5), which is not reflected in the function signature. Since the function signature does not include any parameters, it is unclear how `n` is used or provided to the function. Assuming `n` is somehow used within the function, the output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Given the lack of clear input parameters and output in the provided function signature, the functionality cannot be accurately described. If you can provide more details or correct the function signature to include `n`, I can give a more precise description.

However, based on the given information, we can only state:
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the return value is not specified.**
