Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.** However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(n, k):
```

With the precondition:

**n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
