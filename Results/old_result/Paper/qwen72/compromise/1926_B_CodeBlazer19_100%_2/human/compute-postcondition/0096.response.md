Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it means that at least one input string `s` had exactly one '1' in the last iteration. If `a` is 0, it means no input string `s` had exactly one '1' in the last iteration. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1' in the last iteration; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially, because it represents the total number of test cases.
- `i` is now `t-1` because the loop has executed `t` times, and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- `n` is the last input integer provided for the final test case.
- `j` is `n-1` because the inner loop iterates `n` times, and `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any row in the last test case had exactly one '1'.
- `a` will be 0 if no row in the last test case had exactly one '1'.
- `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any row in the last test case had more than one '1'.
- `b` will be an empty string if no row in the last test case had more than one '1'.
