To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens when `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1` (this is not the initial value of `j` in the loop head; `j` will be set by the loop).
   - `a` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `b` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `j` is not relevant because it will be set by the loop.

### Final State:
- The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 0, and `b` is an empty string.**
