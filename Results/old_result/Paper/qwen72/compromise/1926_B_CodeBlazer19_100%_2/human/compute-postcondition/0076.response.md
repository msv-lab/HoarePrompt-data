Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is an input string. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
