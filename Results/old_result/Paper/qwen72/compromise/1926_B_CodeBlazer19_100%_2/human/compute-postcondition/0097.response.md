The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it is clear that it processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`: An integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid.
- For each test case, a grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.

The function returns the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid for each test case. The shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). It returns the shape (either "triangle" or "square") that includes all the '1's in the grid for each test case. The shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.**
