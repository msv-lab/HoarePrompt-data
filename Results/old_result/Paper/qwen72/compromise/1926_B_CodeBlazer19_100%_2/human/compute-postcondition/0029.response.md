Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is the string 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of the variable `a`.

Since `a` is explicitly defined as 'TRIANGLE', the output will be:

Output: **TRIANGLE**
