Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any input string `s` had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it is used to control the loop's iteration count.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings `s` contained exactly one '1'. If no such string was encountered, `a` remains 0.
- The variable `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings `s` contained more than one '1'. If no such string was encountered, `b` remains an empty string.
