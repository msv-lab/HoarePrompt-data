Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 0, and `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.** 

The value of `a` has been set to 0, overriding its previous value which could have been either 'TRIANGLE' or 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
