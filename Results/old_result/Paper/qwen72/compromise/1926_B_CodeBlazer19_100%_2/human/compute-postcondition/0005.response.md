To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (relevant to the loop head)
- `a` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `b` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start from 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
