The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0**
