The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. This new value of `n` replaces the old value of `n` from the initial state. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is 'TRIANGLE', it indicates that at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. If `a` is 0, it indicates that no input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. In both cases, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**
