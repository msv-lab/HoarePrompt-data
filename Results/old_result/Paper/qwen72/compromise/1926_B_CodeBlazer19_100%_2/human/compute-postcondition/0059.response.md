Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', indicating that at least one input string `s` contained exactly one '1' character during the loop. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**
