To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `n` is a new input integer.
4. `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
5. `a` is initialized to 0.
6. `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, `b` is an empty string.

Given this information, the value of `b` depends on the content of the input string `s` during the loop. If `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` will be 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` will be an empty string.

Since the exact input string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `b` with certainty. However, based on the conditions, the possible values for `b` are either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.

Therefore, the output of the `print(b)` statement will be one of the following:

- If `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` will be 'SQUARE'.
- If `s` does not contain more than one '1' character, `b` will be an empty string.

Output: **b (where b is 'SQUARE' if any input string s contained more than one '1' character during the loop; otherwise, b is an empty string)**
