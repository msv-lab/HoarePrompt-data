Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, such that 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node index and each value is a list of neighboring node indices, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

The `visited` set is now initialized with the `start` node, indicating that the `start` node has been visited. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
