The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, for each test case, and the number of test cases `t`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
