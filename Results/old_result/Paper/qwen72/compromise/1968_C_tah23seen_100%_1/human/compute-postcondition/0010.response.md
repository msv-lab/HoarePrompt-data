Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[n-2]` which is now `1000000000 - arr[n-2]` and `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is now `ans[i + 2] - arr[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 7`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, changing from `n - 6` to `n - 7`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
