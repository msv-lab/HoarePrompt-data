Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that for each \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). The array \( a \) should satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( arr \) which contains \( n-1 \) elements \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an array \( ans \) of length \( n \) with all elements set to \( 10^9 \).
   - It then iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to 0, setting \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of \( ans \) for each test case.

Now, let's check if the function `func_1` correctly constructs the array \( a \):

- **Initialization**:
  - The last element \( ans[n-1] \) is set to \( 10^9 \). This is a valid value since \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

- **Backward Calculation**:
  - For each \( i \) from \( n-2 \) to 0, the function sets \( ans[i] \) to \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).
  - This ensures that \( ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i] = arr[i] \) because \( ans[i+1] \) is a large number and \( ans[i] \) is calculated to be exactly \( ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The values in \( ans \) are calculated as \( ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i] \). Since \( arr[i] \leq 500 \) and \( ans[i+1] = 10^9 \), \( ans[i] \) will always be a positive integer and will be less than \( 10^9 \).
  - Therefore, \( 1 \leq ans[i] \leq 10^9 \) is satisfied for all \( i \).

- **Example Verification**:
  - For the first test case with \( arr = [2, 4, 1] \):
    - \( ans[3] = 10^9 \)
    - \( ans[2] = 10^9 - 1 = 999999999 \)
    - \( ans[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995 \)
    - \( ans[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993 \)
    - The output is \( [999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 10^9] \).
    - Checking the conditions:
      - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 999999995 \bmod 999999993 = 2 = x_2 \)
      - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 999999999 \bmod 999999995 = 4 = x_3 \)
      - \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 10^9 \bmod 999999999 = 1 = x_4 \)
    - The conditions are satisfied.

However, the program provided in the example output does not match the logic of the function `func_1`. The example output suggests a different approach where the values are not necessarily calculated as \( ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i] \).

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the function `func_1` as written is correct in terms of satisfying the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) and the constraints \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

Correctness: **True**
