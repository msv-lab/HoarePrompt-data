Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` becomes less than or equal to 0, which is not allowed according to the problem description (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 500
```

The program will set `ans[2]` to 10^9, and then `ans[1]` to `10^9 - 500`, which is 999500. Next, it will set `ans[0]` to `999500 - 1`, which is 999499. This is a valid case, but the issue arises when the input is such that the subtraction results in a value less than 1. For instance:

```
1
3
1 10^9
```

Here, `ans[2]` is set to 10^9, and `ans[1]` is set to `10^9 - 10^9`, which is 0. This violates the condition that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
