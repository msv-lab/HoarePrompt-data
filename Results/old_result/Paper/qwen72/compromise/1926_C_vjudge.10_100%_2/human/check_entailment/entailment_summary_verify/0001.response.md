### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to ensure the `values` array can handle the maximum possible value of \(n\) (200000).
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - An array `values` of size `inf` is initialized with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each integer from 0 to `inf-1`.

2. **Precomputation of Digit Sums:**
   - The program iterates through each integer \(i\) from 1 to `inf-1`.
   - For each integer \(i\), it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the integer to a string and then summing the integer values of each character in the string.
   - The cumulative sum of the digit sums is stored in `values[i]` by adding the current digit sum to the previous cumulative sum `values[i-1]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of \(n\) from the input.
   - It then prints the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums for the given \(n\) by accessing `values[n]`.

### Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The precomputation step runs in \(O(inf \times \log(inf))\) time, where \(\log(inf)\) is the number of digits in the largest number \(2 \times 10^5\). This is efficient given the constraints.
  - Each test case is processed in \(O(1)\) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` array.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity for \(t\) test cases is \(O(inf \times \log(inf) + t)\), which is feasible within the 0.5 seconds limit for the given constraints.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(inf)\) due to the `values` array, which is also within the limits given the problem constraints.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - For each test case, it correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed value for the given \(n\).

### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
  - It correctly states that `func_1` accepts an integer \(t\) representing the number of test cases.
  - It correctly states that for each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \(n\).
  - It correctly states that the function does not return any value.
  - It correctly states that after the function concludes, `t` remains the same input integer, `inf` remains 200001, and `values` is a list where each element at index \(i\) (for 1 â‰¤ \(i\) < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \(i\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
