Reasoning:  
The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to create a list of test cases, each containing the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case according to the given conditions.

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into a list of strings. The program then iterates over the test cases, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` for each case. This part of the program is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates two residues: `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before in the `residue_map`. If it has, it increments the count by the number of times this pair has been seen.
   - The program updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is used to determine the residue of `-num` modulo `x`. This is equivalent to `x - (num % x)` if `num % x` is not zero, and `0` if `num % x` is zero. This ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The calculation `r_y = num % y` is used to determine the residue of `num` modulo `y`. This ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` and both conditions are met. It does this by leveraging the `residue_map` to keep track of the residues and their counts.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is the count of beautiful pairs for that test case. The output format matches the problem description.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting beautiful pairs. The use of the `residue_map` to track residues and count pairs is efficient and aligns with the problem requirements.
