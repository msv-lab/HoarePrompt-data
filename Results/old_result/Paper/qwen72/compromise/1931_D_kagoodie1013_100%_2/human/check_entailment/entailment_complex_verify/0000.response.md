Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, including `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. This approach is efficient and handles the input correctly.

2. **Test Case Processing**: The program correctly constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: For each test case, the function initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the array elements.
   - **Residue Calculation**: For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`. This is correct because:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `a_j` has the same `r_x` value.
     - `r_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `a_j` has the same `r_y` value.
   - **Counting Pairs**: The program increments the `count` by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. This is correct because it counts the number of elements in `arr` that have the same residues `(r_x, r_y)` as the current element `num`, which means they form a beautiful pair with `num`.
   - **Updating Residue Map**: The program updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`. This is correct because it ensures that the residues of the current element are stored and can be used to count future pairs.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the results for each test case, with each result being the number of beautiful pairs found in the corresponding array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` or `y` is 1, which means every pair is beautiful.
   - The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are large, ensuring that the modulo operations are performed correctly.
   - The program handles the case where the array `arr` has duplicate elements, correctly counting the pairs formed by these duplicates.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to keep track of residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates (O(1) on average).
   - The overall time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. This is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
