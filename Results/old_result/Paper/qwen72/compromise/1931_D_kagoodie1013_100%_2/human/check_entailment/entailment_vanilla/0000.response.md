Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, including `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores the test cases in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. This is a good way to organize the data for processing.

3. **Residue Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs. It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to store the counts of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x` and `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks if the current pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them, each on a new line.

6. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the residues is correct. The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is used to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - The use of the `residue_map` to count pairs is also correct. By storing the residues and their counts, the program efficiently counts the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2, which is the minimum allowed value.
   - It also handles the case where the array elements are all the same, as the residues will be the same, and the program will correctly count the pairs.

8. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each test case in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
