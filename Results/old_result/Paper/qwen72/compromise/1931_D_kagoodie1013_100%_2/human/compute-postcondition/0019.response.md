The code snippet updates the `count` variable by adding the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If the key `(r_x, r_y)` is not found in `residue_map`, the default value `0` is used.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple.
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple.
- `y` is the third element of the first tuple.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has at least 3 elements.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 1.
- `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`.
- `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- `r_x` is `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is `num % y`.
- `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.

Let's calculate the new value of `count`:
- `r_x` is `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is `num % y`.
- `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.

Since `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, the value `2` will be retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by `2`.

The new value of `count` is `1 + 2 = 3`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 3, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
