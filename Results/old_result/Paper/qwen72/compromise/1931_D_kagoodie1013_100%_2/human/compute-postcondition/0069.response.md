Output State: **`arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr` processed by the loop, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have appeared before the current element in the loop, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times this tuple has appeared in the loop, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element and has one more element than before.**
