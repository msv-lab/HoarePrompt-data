You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, and y, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list of integers a of length n, such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the first element of the last tuple processed, `x` is the second element of the last tuple processed, `y` is the third element of the last tuple processed, `arr` is the fourth element of the last tuple processed and has `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for the last tuple processed, `residue_map` contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in the last `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that pair has been encountered, `num` is the last element of the last `arr` processed, `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is `num % y` for the last element, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `count` value for each tuple represents the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for that tuple, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in the `arr` of that tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, integers `x` and `y`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for each tuple, with `r_x` being `-num % x` and `r_y` being `num % y` for each `num` in the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results` which contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `count` value for each tuple represents the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for that tuple, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in the `arr` of that tuple.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
