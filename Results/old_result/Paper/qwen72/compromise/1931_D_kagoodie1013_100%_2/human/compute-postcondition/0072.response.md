The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`. The constraints for these elements are as follows: `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= x, y <= 10^9`, and each tuple also includes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, such that `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

The function returns a list `results` which contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `count` value for each tuple represents the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for that tuple, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in the `arr` of that tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, integers `x` and `y`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for each tuple, with `r_x` being `-num % x` and `r_y` being `num % y` for each `num` in the list `a`.**
