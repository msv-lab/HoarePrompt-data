Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once, `residue_map` contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that pair has been encountered, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
