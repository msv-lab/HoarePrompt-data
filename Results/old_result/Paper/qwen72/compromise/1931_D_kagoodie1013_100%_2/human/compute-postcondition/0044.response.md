Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is now `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` or by 0 if the key is not found.**

Explanation:
- The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to be the current value of `residue_map[current_key]` (or 0 if `current_key` is not in `residue_map`) plus 1.
- The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` remain unchanged.
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` or by 0 if the key is not found.
