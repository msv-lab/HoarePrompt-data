The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` based on the current values of `num` and `x`. Given the initial state, `num` is the third element of `arr`, and `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`. The new value of `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.

Let's break it down:
- `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 1, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
