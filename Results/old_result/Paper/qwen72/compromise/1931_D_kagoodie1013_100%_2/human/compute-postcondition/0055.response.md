Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is now `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_key` is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)`, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y`.
- The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` updates the value of `residue_map` at the key `current_key` by incrementing it by 1. If `current_key` is not already in `residue_map`, it initializes it to 1.
- The values of `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` remain unchanged.
- The value of `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which is the previous value of `residue_map[current_key]` before the increment.
