Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still large enough to isolate some islands. For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \). The program will output 5, but the correct output should be 3. 

Here's why:
- Initially, all 5 islands are connected.
- If Dominater destroys 3 bridges, the optimal strategy would be to isolate one island from the others, leaving only 3 islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit.

The program should account for this scenario and correctly calculate the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.
