Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem for the given constraints and examples. Here's the reasoning:

1. **If \( k \geq n - 1 \)**:
   - If Dominater can destroy at least \( n - 1 \) bridges, Everule will be isolated on island 1, as destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges will disconnect island 1 from all other islands.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is 1.

2. **If \( k < n - 1 \)**:
   - If Dominater can destroy fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges, Everule will still be able to visit all \( n \) islands because there will always be enough bridges left to form a connected graph.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is \( n \).

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given examples. Thus, the program is correct.
