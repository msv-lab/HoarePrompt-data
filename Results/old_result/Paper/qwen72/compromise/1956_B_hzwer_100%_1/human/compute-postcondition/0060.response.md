Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `cnt`.
- For each `x`, the value `max(0, x - 1)` is added to `ans`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
