The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0) obtained from user input.

After executing the code:
- `a` is now a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), and `a` is a list of integers derived from user input.**
