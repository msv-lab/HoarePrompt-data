Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0 except `cnt[x]` which is now 2, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, `x` is the second element in `a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
