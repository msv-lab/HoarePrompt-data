You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, the following holds: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. Each `ans` value is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cards with specific numbers, and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
