To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `cnt` in the loop head. The loop iterates over each element in `cnt`, so for the loop to execute, `cnt` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements
- `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`
- `ans` is 0

We need to ensure that `cnt` is not empty. Since `cnt` is defined as a list of length `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cnt` will always have at least one element (since the minimum value of `n` is 1, making the length of `cnt` at least 2).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `cnt` is defined as specified.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with `len(a)` elements, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`, `ans` is 0**
