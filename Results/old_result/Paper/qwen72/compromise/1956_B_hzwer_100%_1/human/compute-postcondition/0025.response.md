To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `a`, which is the only object in the loop head. The loop will execute if `a` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given that `a` is a list of integers read from the input, for the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`**
