The line `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that any subsequent calls to `input()` will now read a single line from standard input.

The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` (representing the numbers on the cards) are not directly modified by this line of code. However, the way input is handled in the program changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards each player receives, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers representing the numbers on the cards in your hand, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `input` now reads a single line from standard input.**
