Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by simply counting how many pairs of cards you have, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy when considering Nene's optimal play.

A counterexample to show the program's incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- You have cards `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.
- Nene has cards `[2, 3, 4, 4]`.

If you play optimally and Nene plays optimally, the game might proceed as follows:
1. You play `1` (no points, table: `[1]`).
2. Nene plays `4` (no points, table: `[1, 4]`).
3. You play `1` (1 point, table: `[1, 1, 4]`).
4. Nene plays `4` (1 point, table: `[1, 1, 4, 4]`).
5. You play `2` (no points, table: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 2]`).
6. Nene plays `2` (1 point, table: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2]`).
7. You play `3` (no points, table: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3]`).
8. Nene plays `3` (1 point, table: `[1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3]`).

At the end of the game, you score 1 point, and Nene scores 3 points. The program incorrectly outputs 2 points, which is not the optimal result given Nene's optimal play. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
