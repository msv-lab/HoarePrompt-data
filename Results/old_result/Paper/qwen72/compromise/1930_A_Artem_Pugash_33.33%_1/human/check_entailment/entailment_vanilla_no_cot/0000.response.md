Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it processes the list of numbers. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `numbers` list is sorted and processed. The `numbers` list is initially a list of strings, and when sorting a list of strings, they are sorted lexicographically, not numerically. This means that the sorting will not work as intended for numbers with different lengths (e.g., "10" comes before "2" in lexicographical order).

To fix this, the numbers should be converted to integers before sorting. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Convert to integers
        numbers.sort()  # Sort as integers
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly sort the numbers and compute the maximum score as required by the problem statement.
