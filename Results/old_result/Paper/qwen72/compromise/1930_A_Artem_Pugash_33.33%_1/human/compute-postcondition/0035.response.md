Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `a` is the integer value of the second element of `numbers` (after the pop operation), `b` is the integer value of the first element of `numbers` (before the pop operation), `suma` is `2 * b`, and `numbers` contains at least zero elements.** 

Explanation:
- `a` is updated to the integer value of the first element of `numbers` before the pop operation, which means `a` now holds the value of the second element of `numbers` after the pop operation.
- `b` remains the same, holding the value of the first element of `numbers` before the pop operation.
- `suma` remains `2 * b` since `b` has not changed.
- `numbers` loses its first element, so it now contains at least zero elements.
