The code snippet `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns its integer value to the variable `b`.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `numCases` remains an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000.
- `i` remains 0.
- `numInteger` remains an input integer.
- `numbers` is now a sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first five elements removed (since the first four were already removed and now one more is removed).
- `a` remains the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`.
- `b` is now the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`.
- `suma` remains \(2 \times \text{min}(a, b)\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first five elements removed, `a` is the integer value of the fourth element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the fifth element that was removed from `numbers`, `suma` is \(2 \times \text{min}(a, b)\).**
