Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer where 1 ≤ numCases ≤ 5000, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `numbers` is not empty.
- In each iteration, two elements are removed from the beginning of the `numbers` list, converted to integers, and the smaller of the two is added to `suma`.
- After all iterations, `numbers` will be empty because all elements have been processed.
- The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers that were removed from `numbers`.
- The variables `t`, `numCases`, `i`, and `numInteger` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
