Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has a logical error in the way it initializes the `defaultdict`. The `default_value` function is not defined, which will cause a NameError when the program tries to use the `defaultdict`. Instead, the `defaultdict` should be initialized with a default factory that returns an integer zero, such as `int`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize defaultdict with int as the default factory
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Iterate over all required difficulty levels
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` properly and iterates over the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') to calculate the number of additional problems needed. This ensures that the program works correctly for the given problem description.
