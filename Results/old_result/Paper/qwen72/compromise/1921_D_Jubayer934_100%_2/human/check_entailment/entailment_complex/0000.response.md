### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads and sorts the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `b` is sorted in descending order and then the first `m` elements are taken (though this is redundant since `b` is already of length `m`).

3. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute differences.
   - If at any point, the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element from the end of `b` is greater than the difference with the current element of `b`, it switches to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` for the remaining elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Slicing in `b`:**
  - The line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` is redundant because `b` is already of length `m`. It should be simply `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)`.
- **Incorrect Pairing Logic:**
  - The logic for switching to pairing elements from the start of `a` with elements from the end of `b` is incorrect. The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not the correct way to maximize the total difference `D`.
  - To maximize `D`, Vasya should always pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b`.

### Correct Approach:
- **Maximize Differences:**
  - To maximize the total difference `D`, Vasya should pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b`.
  - This can be achieved by sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, and then taking the first `n` elements of `b` to ensure the largest possible differences.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        ans = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))
        
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly maximize the total difference `D` due to the incorrect pairing logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
