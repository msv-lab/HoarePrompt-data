Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. The main issue lies in how the program selects elements from the `b` array to maximize the difference `D`. The program attempts to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and then switches to pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b` if a better difference is found. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum total difference `D`.

To correctly solve the problem, Vasya should aim to maximize the absolute difference for each element in `a` by either pairing it with the smallest or the largest available element in `b`. The optimal strategy involves sorting both arrays and then considering the two possible pairings for each element in `a` (either with the smallest or the largest remaining element in `b`) and selecting the one that maximizes the total difference.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize two pointers for the smallest and largest elements in b
        left = 0
        right = m - 1
        
        # Initialize the total difference
        total_diff = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the difference with the smallest and largest elements in b
            diff_left = abs(a[i] - b[left])
            diff_right = abs(a[i] - b[right])
            
            # Choose the larger difference
            if diff_left > diff_right:
                total_diff += diff_left
                left += 1
            else:
                total_diff += diff_right
                right -= 1
        
        print(total_diff)
```

This corrected version ensures that for each element in `a`, the maximum possible difference is chosen by comparing the differences with the smallest and largest remaining elements in `b`. This approach guarantees the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.
