Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.***
