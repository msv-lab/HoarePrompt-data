Postcondition: ***`t`, `a_i`, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.***
