Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is `n`, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, `ans` has one more element which is the absolute difference between `a[n]` and `b[-(n - n)]`.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` has been updated to include one more element, which is the absolute difference between the element at index `n` of the list `a` and the element at index `0` of the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
