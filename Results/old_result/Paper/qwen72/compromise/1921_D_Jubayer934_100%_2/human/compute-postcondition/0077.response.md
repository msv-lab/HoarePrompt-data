Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `temp` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` to the list `ans`.
- Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]` and `b[i]` is `b[0]`.
- The value of `ans` is now a list containing one element, which is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `a_i`, `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
