The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2**
