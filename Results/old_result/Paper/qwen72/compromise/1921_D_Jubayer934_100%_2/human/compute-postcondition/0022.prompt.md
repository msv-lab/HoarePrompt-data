Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `temp` is -1. `ans` is an empty list. `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. If the condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the second element is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, the second element is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and the third element is the absolute difference between `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` remains -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
