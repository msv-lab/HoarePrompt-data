Output State: **`i` is `n`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n`.
- The variable `temp` remains an integer such that `temp < n`.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer.
- The variables `t` and `a_i` remain -1.
- The list `a` remains a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` remains a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The list `ans` now contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, as well as the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.
