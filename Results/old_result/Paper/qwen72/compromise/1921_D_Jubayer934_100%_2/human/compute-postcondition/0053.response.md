Postcondition: ***`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1 or 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.***
