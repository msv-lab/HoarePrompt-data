To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1**
