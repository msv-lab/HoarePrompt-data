To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is -1.
   - `a_i` is -1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not -1, then `i` is `n`, `temp` is an integer such that `temp < n`, and `ans` also contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.

2. **Understanding the Lists:**
   - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.

3. **Building the `ans` List:**
   - The `ans` list is initially populated with the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not -1, additional elements are added to `ans` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, where the differences are between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

4. **Summing the `ans` List:**
   - The `sum(ans)` function will calculate the sum of all elements in the `ans` list.

5. **Determining the Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of all absolute differences in the `ans` list.
   - If `temp` is -1, the `ans` list will only contain the differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `temp` is not -1, the `ans` list will also contain the differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list containing the absolute differences between a[i] and b[i] for all i from 0 to n-1, and if temp is not -1, also contains the absolute differences between a[i] and b[-(n - i)] for all i from temp to n-1)**
