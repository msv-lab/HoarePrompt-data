Output State: **`t` is -1, `a_i` is -1, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is the number of elements in list `a` and is an input integer, `m` is the number of elements in list `b` and is an input integer, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.**

The code snippet `ans = []` resets the list `ans` to an empty list, overriding its previous content. The values of `t`, `a_i`, `temp`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
