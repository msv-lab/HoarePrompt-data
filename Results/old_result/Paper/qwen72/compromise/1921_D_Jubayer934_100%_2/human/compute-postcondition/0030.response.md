Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and `ans` now contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b` remain unchanged. `i` is set to `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where the loop broke. `temp` remains the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and it is not -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ans` will have been updated to include the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements from the end of `b` (i.e., `b[-(n - i)]`) for all indices `i` starting from `temp` up to `n-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b` will remain the same as they were before the loop started. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations, or to the index where the loop broke. The variable `temp` will still be the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, and it will not be -1.
