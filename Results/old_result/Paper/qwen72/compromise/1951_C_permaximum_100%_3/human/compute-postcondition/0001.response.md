Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heap (a priority queue) of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. The heap property ensures that the smallest element is at the root of the heap. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `prices` also remains unchanged. The only change is that `pq` is now a heap, which is a specific type of data structure that allows efficient access to the smallest element.
