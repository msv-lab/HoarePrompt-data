Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heap (a priority queue) of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their initial states remain unchanged. The output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the `tickets_bought` variable being set to 0.
