Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged, `vis[pb - 1]` is 0, and `pathb` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.**

The code snippet `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `pathb`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged, including the value of `vis[pb - 1]` which is still 0. The updated `pathb` now contains the element `a[pb - 1]` in addition to its previous elements.
