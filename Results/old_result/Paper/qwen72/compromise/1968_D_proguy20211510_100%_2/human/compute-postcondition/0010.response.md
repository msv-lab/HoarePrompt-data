Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**

The code `vis[pb - 1] = 1` updates the list `vis` by setting the element at index `pb - 1` to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
