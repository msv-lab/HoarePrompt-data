Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integer `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
