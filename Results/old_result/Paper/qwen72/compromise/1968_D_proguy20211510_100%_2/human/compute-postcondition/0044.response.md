Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the final value after all iterations, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
