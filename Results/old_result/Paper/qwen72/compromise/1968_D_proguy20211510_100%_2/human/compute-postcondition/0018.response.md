Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` and the new value `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the current value of `vis[pb - 1]` remains 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
