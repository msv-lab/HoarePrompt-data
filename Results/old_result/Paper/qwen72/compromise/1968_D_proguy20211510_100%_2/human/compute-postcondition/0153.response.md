Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, `resb`, and `pathb` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `paths` is a list that now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, appended to its end until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; `ps` is now the value of the last index in the sequence `p[ps - 1]`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, that was visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1); `resb` is now the maximum value between the previous `resb` (which was 0) and the current `curr` (which is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`); `i` is incremented by 1; `pathb` must have at least `i + 1` elements.***
