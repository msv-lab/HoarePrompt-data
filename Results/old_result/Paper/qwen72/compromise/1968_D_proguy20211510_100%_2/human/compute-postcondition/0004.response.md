The code snippet `n, k, pb, ps = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into four parts, assigning each part to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` respectively. The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code snippet, and the temporary variable `_` is not modified. 

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings representing the split parts of the input.**
