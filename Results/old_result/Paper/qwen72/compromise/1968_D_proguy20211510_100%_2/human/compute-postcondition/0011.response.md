Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state variables for the first iteration to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1**
