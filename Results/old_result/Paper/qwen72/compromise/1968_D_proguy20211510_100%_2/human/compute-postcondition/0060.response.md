Output State: **`pathb` must have at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`.
- The other conditions and variables (`pathb` having at least two elements, `i` being incremented by 1, the condition for breaking out of the loop, and the value of `curr`) remain unchanged.
