Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(pathb)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least `len(pathb) + 1` elements. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, and `ress` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `ress` and the new `curr`.***
