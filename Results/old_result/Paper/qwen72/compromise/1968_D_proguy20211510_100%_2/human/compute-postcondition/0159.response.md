Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, and `pathb` remain unchanged, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`, `len(pathb)` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `k` < `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
