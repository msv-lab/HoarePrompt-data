Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, `resb`, and `pathb` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain valid after the `break` statement is executed.
