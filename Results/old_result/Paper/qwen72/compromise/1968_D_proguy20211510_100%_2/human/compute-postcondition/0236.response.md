Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1 at any point during the loop execution, the loop is broken out of.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged.
- The `vis` array is updated such that the element at the index `ps - 1` is set to 1.
- The `paths` list is updated to include the elements from the array `a` at the indices `ps - 1`, `p[ps - 1] - 1`, and `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1` in that order.
- The variable `ps` is updated to the value `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`.
- The loop will break if at any point `vis[ps - 1]` is already 1.
