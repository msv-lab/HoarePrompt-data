The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `paths`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths`. If `paths` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop executes, `paths` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `paths` must have at least 1 element**
