Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged. `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`. `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1` where `k >= i`. `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`. `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1` where `k >= i`. The final output is 'Bodya' if `resb` is greater than `ress`, 'Sasha' if `ress` is greater than `resb`, and 'Draw' if `resb` is equal to `ress`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the following variables remain unchanged:
- `n` (the length of the permutation)
- `k` (the duration of the game)
- `p` (the permutation list)
- `a` (the array of scores)
- `pb` (the starting position of Bodya)
- `ps` (the starting position of Sasha)
- `pathb` (the path Bodya takes through the permutation)
- `paths` (the path Sasha takes through the permutation)
- `vis` (the list used to mark visited positions)

The variables that are updated by the loop are:
- `preb` (the cumulative sum of the scores Bodya has collected up to the point where `k` is less than the iteration index or the path length is reached)
- `resb` (the maximum score Bodya can achieve within the game duration `k`)
- `pres` (the cumulative sum of the scores Sasha has collected up to the point where `k` is less than the iteration index or the path length is reached)
- `ress` (the maximum score Sasha can achieve within the game duration `k`)

The final output of the loop is determined by comparing `resb` and `ress`:
- If `resb` is greater than `ress`, the output is 'Bodya'.
- If `ress` is greater than `resb`, the output is 'Sasha'.
- If `resb` is equal to `ress`, the output is 'Draw'.
