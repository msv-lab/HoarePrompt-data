Output State: **`i` is 1, `pathb` is a list with at least 2 elements, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
