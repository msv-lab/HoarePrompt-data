Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `curr` is now `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `paths`, `ps`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress` is now the maximum of `ress` and `curr` from the previous iteration, `pres` is now `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `paths` must have at least `i + 1` elements. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `curr`, `paths`, `ps`, `preb`, `resb`, and `pres` remain the same as described in the initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `paths` must still have at least `i + 1` elements. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
