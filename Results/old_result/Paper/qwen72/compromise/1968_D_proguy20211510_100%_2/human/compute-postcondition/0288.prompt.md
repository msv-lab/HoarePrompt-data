Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array of scores. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'. MOD is 1000000007. `alpha` is a string of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After the loop completes all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller. `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`. `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains the maximum value encountered during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1; and the relationship between `resb` and `ress` is preserved (either `resb` is greater than `ress` or `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `len(paths)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` from index 0 to `len(paths) - 1` that were processed before `k` became less than `i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between the initial `ress` and the values of `curr` calculated during the loop, and `curr` is the last calculated value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` before the loop terminated. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
