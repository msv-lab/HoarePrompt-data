Output State: **`i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= j`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(pathb) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the `pathb` list.
- **`preb`**: `preb` will be the sum of all elements in the `pathb` list. This is because in each iteration, `preb` is incremented by the current element of `pathb`.
- **`resb`**: `resb` will be the maximum value of the expression `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for all indices `j` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1`, but only for those indices where `k` is greater than or equal to `j`. This means that `resb` will be the highest value that `curr` ever reached during the loop execution.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `ps`, `curr`, `vis`, `paths`, `ress`, and `resb` from the initial state) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
