Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb` remain unchanged, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.** 

In natural language: The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are still integers, and `a` is still a list of integers provided by the user. The variables `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged. The variables `pathb` and `paths` are now both empty lists.
