Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is now 1.** 

The value of `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, while all other elements in the `vis` list remain 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.
