Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`. If `k < 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`.
- The values of `paths`, `i`, `pres`, and `ress` remain the same as in the initial state.
- The condition `k < i + 1` (which is `k < 2`) is checked. If this condition is true, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
