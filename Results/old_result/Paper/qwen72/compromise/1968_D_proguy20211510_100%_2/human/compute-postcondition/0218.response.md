Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. `pathb` contains the elements from `a` that were visited starting from `a[pb - 1]` until a previously visited index (where `vis[pb - 1]` is 1) is encountered. `pb` is now equal to the index where the loop broke out, which is the previously visited index. `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `vis = [0] * n` initializes the `vis` list to have `n` elements, all set to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `pathb`) and their relationships remain unchanged.
