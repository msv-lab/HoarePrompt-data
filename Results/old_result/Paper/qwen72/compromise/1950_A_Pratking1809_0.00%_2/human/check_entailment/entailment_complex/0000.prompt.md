Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are the last input integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, q is reduced by the number of iterations executed, mn remains 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, where `1 <= q <= 1000`. It then processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are left with the values of the last test case. The variable `mn` remains unchanged at 100, and `q` is reduced by the number of test cases processed.
