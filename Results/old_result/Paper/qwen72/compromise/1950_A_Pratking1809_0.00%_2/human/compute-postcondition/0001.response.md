Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; q is an input integer; mn is 100.** 

The variable `mn` is assigned the value 100, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
