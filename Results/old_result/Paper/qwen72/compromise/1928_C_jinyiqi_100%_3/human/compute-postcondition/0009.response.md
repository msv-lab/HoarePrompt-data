Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output1` is a list containing `[2]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`. `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `x` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `output1` remains unchanged: it is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise it is a list containing `[2]`.
- `output2` is updated by appending the integer result of `x` divided by `i` (which is 2). If `x` is divisible by `1`, `output2` was initially `[x]` and now becomes `[x, int(x / 2)]`. If `x` is not divisible by `1`, `output2` was initially an empty list and now becomes `[int(x / 2)]`.
- `i` remains 2.
