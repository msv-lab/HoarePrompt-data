Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` for the template to exist. If this condition is met, the program sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the program checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If this condition is met, the program sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next index.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the program prints 'YES'.
   - If `possible` remains `False`, the program prints 'NO'.

This logic correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the conditions for the template `t` are checked for each index. The program handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
