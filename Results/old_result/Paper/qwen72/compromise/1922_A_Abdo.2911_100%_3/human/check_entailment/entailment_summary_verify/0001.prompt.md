You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. The function checks if there is any index `i` where either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such an index is found for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template can be found.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the template must have an uppercase letter at position `i` that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then the template can be valid, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the template must have a lowercase letter at position `i` that matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then the template cannot be valid, and the loop continues to the next position.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then the template can be valid, and `possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have an uppercase letter at position `i` that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template must have a lowercase letter at position `i` that matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the loop continues.
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` is `False`, so we check if `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - `c[0]` is "c", which is different from both "a" and "b". Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` is `False`, so we check if `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - `c[0]` is "a", which is equal to `a[0]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[1] == b[1]` is `False`, so we check if `c[1]` is different from both `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
  - `c[1]` is "a", which is equal to `a[1]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - The output is "NO".

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]`, and `c[0]` is "a", which is different from both "m" and "l". Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - `a[0] != b[0]`, and `c[0]` is "a", which is equal to `a[0]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[1] != b[1]`, and `c[1]` is "b", which is equal to `b[1]`. Therefore, `possible` remains `False`.
  - `a[2] == b[2]`, and `c[2]` is "c", which is different from `a[2]` (or `b[2]`). Therefore, `possible` is set to `True`, and the output is "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions are checked accurately, and the output is correct for the given examples.
