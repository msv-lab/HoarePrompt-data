The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 again, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`**.
