Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is True if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional effect that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
