Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
