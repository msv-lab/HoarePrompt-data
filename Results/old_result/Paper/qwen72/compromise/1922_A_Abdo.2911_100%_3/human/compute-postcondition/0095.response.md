The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, which is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is `False`**
