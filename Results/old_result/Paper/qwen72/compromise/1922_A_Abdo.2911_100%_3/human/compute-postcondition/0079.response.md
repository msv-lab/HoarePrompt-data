Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is True.**

The value of `possible` is set to True, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `possible` being True based on the characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` at index `i` is not affected by this assignment.
