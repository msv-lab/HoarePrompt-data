Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take four parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. `t` is now an input integer between 1 and 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions within the loop. If `possible` is True, `possible` remains True. If `possible` is False, `possible` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer, a is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, b is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, c is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1, and possible retains its initial value. If possible is True, at least one of the following conditions is met: (1) There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or (2) There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`. If possible is False, none of these conditions are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer greater than 0, a, b, and c are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1. If `possible` is True, it means that at least one of the following conditions has been met during the loop execution: (1) a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or (2) a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If `possible` is False, none of these conditions have been met during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
