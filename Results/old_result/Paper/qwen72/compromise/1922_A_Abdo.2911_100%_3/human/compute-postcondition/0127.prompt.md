Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is also set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`, `possible` is set to True if the conditions in the loop body were met, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
