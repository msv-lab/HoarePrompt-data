Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
