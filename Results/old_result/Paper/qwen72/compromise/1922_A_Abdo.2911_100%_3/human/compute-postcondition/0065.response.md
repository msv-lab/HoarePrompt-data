The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted as it is incremented by the loop, and the state of `n` must be such that the loop can continue to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is True or False based on the conditions described.**
