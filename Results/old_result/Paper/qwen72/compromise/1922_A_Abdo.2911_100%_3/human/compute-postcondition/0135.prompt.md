You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: _ is t-1, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer greater than 0, a, b, and c are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1. If `possible` is True, it means that at least one of the following conditions has been met during the loop execution for any of the test cases: (1) a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or (2) a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If `possible` is False, none of these conditions have been met during the loop execution for any of the test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, an integer `n` (length of strings) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
