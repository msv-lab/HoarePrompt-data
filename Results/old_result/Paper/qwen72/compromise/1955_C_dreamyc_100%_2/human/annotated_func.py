#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.

    #State: n and k are positive integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9. Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.

    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list, `s_a` is the sum of the first `ans` elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a`, and `s_b` is the sum of the last `ans` elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates two thresholds: `a` (the ceiling of `k / 2`) and `b` (the integer division of `k` by 2). The function then returns the total count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` when counted from the start of the list, plus the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
