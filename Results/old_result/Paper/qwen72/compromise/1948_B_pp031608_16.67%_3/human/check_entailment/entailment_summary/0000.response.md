### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if it can be made sorted by splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is not sorted and an element greater than 10 is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1` and prints 'Yes' if it is, otherwise 'No'.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only splits the first element that is greater than 10 and greater than the next element. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible elements that need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes a single pass through the array, which means it may not catch all elements that need to be split. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` but not `45` or `67` if they are not immediately out of order.
   - **No Recursive or Iterative Splitting**: The program does not handle the case where splitting one element might cause another element to become out of order, requiring further splits.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`**:
     - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
     - The array is now sorted, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 2: `[12, 28, 5]`**:
     - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
     - The array is not sorted, and the program will not split `28` or `5` further, so it incorrectly prints 'No'.
   - **Test Case 3: `[0, 0]`**:
     - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the splitting of elements in a way that ensures the array can be made sorted in all cases. Specifically, it only splits the first out-of-order element that is greater than 10, and it does not consider the possibility of further splits being necessary to achieve a sorted array.

**Correctness: False**
