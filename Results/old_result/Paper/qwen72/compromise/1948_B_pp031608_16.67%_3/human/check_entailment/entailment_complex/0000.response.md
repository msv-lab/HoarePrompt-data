Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Sorting Check Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version. This is a correct approach to determine if the list is sorted.

3. **Operation Simulation**: The program attempts to perform the operation (splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10) in a loop. However, the logic for performing the operation is flawed:
   - The program checks if the list is not sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the list is not sorted and the previous element is greater than the current element and is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - The problem with this approach is that it only checks and splits the previous element when it finds an unsorted pair. This is not sufficient because:
     - It does not consider the possibility of splitting the current element if it is greater than or equal to 10.
     - It does not re-check the entire list after each split to ensure that the list is still not sorted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program correctly splits the first element to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
   - For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program only splits the first element to `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted. It should split `28` to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` and then the list would be sorted.
   - For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the program correctly identifies that the list is already sorted.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not fully simulate the required operations to ensure the list can be sorted. Specifically, it only considers splitting the previous element when it finds an unsorted pair, which is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
