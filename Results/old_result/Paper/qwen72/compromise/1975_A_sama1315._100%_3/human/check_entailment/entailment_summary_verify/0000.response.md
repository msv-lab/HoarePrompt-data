### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Logic**: The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts, swapping them, and checking if the result matches the sorted array.
   - **Detailed Analysis**:
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself, creating `concatenated_a`.
     - The function iterates over the possible starting points for the prefix and suffix split (from 0 to `n-1`).
     - For each starting point `i`, it checks if the subarray `concatenated_a[i:i + n]` (which is the result of a possible swap) is equal to `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If no match is found after all iterations, it returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The logic is sound because if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
     - This approach ensures that all possible splits are considered, including the case where no split is needed (i.e., the array is already sorted).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Logic**: The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case to determine if the array can be sorted.
   - **Detailed Analysis**:
     - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
     - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from `data`.
     - It processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array `a` from `data`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input.
     - It handles multiple test cases as specified.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - The results are printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is sound and covers the required edge cases, and `func_2` processes the input and test cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
