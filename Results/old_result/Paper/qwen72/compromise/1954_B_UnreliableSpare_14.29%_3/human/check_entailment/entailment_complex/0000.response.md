Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr`.

2. **Flag Initialization**:
   - The flag `flag` is initialized to `True` and is used to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - The loop iterates through the array to check if any two consecutive elements are different. If they are, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

3. **Minimum Consecutive Elements Calculation**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - The variable `val` is set to the first element of the array, and `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements equal to `val`.
   - When a different element is encountered, the minimum count `ans` is updated with the current count `cnt`.
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated with the final count `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program prints `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has different elements by finding the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in linear time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic:
- The program only checks the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element. This might not be sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, if the array is `1 2 1 2 1`, the program will only consider the first element `1` and might miss other patterns that could be used to make the array non-beautiful.

To fix this, the program should consider all elements in the array and find the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all elements in the array when determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the first element, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
