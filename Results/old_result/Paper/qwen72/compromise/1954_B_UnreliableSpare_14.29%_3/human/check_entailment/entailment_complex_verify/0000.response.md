### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly applying the operation on elements `a_i` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The initial assessment states that the program does not handle all possible scenarios where the array can be made not beautiful.
   - It specifically mentions a test case where the array is already not beautiful or can be made not beautiful by removing fewer elements than the current logic suggests.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for each test case.
   - It sets a flag `flag` to `True` and checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - It initializes `ans` to infinity and `val` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements equal to `val` and updating `ans` to the minimum count of such elements.
   - Finally, it prints `-1` if `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), otherwise it prints `ans`.

4. **Key Issues**:
   - The program only checks if all elements are the same and calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider other ways to make the array non-beautiful, such as removing elements that disrupt the pattern of `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

5. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case `1 2 1 3 1`:
     - The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation on index 2 to make it `[1, 1, 1, 3, 1]`, and then on index 3 to make it `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - The program will output `1` because it only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered.
     - However, the correct output should be `1` because removing the `3` at index 3 makes the array non-beautiful.

6. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program's logic is insufficient to handle all cases where the array can be made non-beautiful.
   - It only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not a comprehensive approach to solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
