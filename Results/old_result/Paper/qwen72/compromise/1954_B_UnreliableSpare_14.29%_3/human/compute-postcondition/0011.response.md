The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. 

Based on the initial state:
- `flag` is `True`, indicating that all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered.
- `val` is `arr[0]`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop.
- `ans` is now the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
