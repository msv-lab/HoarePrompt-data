Postcondition: **`flag` is `True`, indicating that all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop. `ans` is now the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`.**
