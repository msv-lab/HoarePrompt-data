Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the beautiful array, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided as an input parameter. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers.
