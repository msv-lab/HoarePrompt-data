### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Stair Condition**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` using the condition `if a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description and the annotated code confirms that this condition is checked properly.

3. **Equal Digits Condition**:
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `elif a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.
   - The annotated code confirms that this condition is checked after the stair condition.

4. **Peak Condition**:
   - The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This is correct because a peak is defined as `a < b > c`, and if `b` is the maximum, it implies that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.
   - However, the annotated code and the original assessment do not consider the case where `a == c` and `b` is the maximum. This should still be classified as "PEAK" but the current implementation will print "PEAK" in such cases, which is correct.

5. **None Condition**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they are classified as "NONE".
   - The annotated code confirms that this is the final condition checked.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program does not handle the case where `a == c` and `b` is the maximum separately, but this is not necessary because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` will still correctly identify it as a peak.
- The program does not explicitly check for `a < b > c` but relies on `max(a, b, c) == b` to infer this condition, which is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
