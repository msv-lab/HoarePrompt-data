Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and List Creation:**
   - The user is prompted to input an integer, which is then converted to an integer using `int(input())`.
   - This integer is used to create a list `a` containing integers from 1 to the input integer inclusive. For example, if the input is 5, `a` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Reversing Elements at Even Indices:**
   - Even indices in Python are 0, 2, 4, etc.
   - The elements at these even indices are reversed. This means that the elements at even indices are placed in reverse order within the list.

### Example:
- If the input is 5, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`.
- Placing these reversed elements back into the even indices of the list results in `a` becoming `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### General Case:
- For any input `n`, the list `a` will initially be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- The elements at even indices will be reversed, resulting in the list where the elements at even indices are in reverse order.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the list `a` with elements at even indices reversed, printed as a space-separated sequence of integers.

Output: **[5, 2, 3, 4, 1] (where the elements at even indices of the list are reversed, and the list is printed as a space-separated sequence of integers)**

Note: The exact output will depend on the user's input, but the structure will always follow the pattern described. If the input is `n`, the output will be a list of integers from 1 to `n` with elements at even indices reversed.
