Reasoning:

The program provided is incorrect based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly, but it does not handle the input in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it reads the array `a` as a list of strings and then passes the length of this list to the function `func_1`. This is incorrect because the function `func_1` should be working with the actual array of integers, not just its length.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle only two specific cases:
   - If the length of the array is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

   This logic is overly simplistic and does not attempt to solve the problem for any other array lengths or values. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing the specified operations, and the function does not implement any logic to do this. It simply prints a hardcoded output, which is not a general solution.

3. **Output Format**: The function correctly follows the output format for the specific cases it handles, but it does not provide a solution for the general case. The output should include the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum, but the function does not compute these values.

4. **General Solution**: The problem requires a more complex algorithm to determine the MEX of a subarray and then apply the operation to maximize the sum. The provided function does not implement this algorithm and instead relies on hardcoded outputs for specific cases.

Given these points, the program is not a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
