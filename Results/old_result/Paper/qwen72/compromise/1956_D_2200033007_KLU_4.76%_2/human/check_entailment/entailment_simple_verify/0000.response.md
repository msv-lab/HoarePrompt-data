Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles two specific cases: when the array length is 2, it outputs a hardcoded result of `4 1` followed by `1 2`, and for any other array length, it outputs a hardcoded result of `13 0`. This approach is not a general solution and fails to correctly compute the MEX for any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements for most inputs.

For example, with the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is incorrect because the correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
The program does not actually process the array or compute the MEX, and it does not generate a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
