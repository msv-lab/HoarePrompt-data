The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a string of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and the strings consist of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, based on the input parameters, the function is likely intended to perform some operation involving the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of which is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function's return value is not specified.**
