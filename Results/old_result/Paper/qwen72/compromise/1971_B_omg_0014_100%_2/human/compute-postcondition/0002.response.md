Output State: **The loop will have processed `n` test cases, where for each test case: if the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s` depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order or not. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated for each iteration based on the current string `s`, but their values will not persist outside the loop.**
