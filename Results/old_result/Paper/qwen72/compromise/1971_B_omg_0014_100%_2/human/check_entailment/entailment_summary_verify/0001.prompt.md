You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of the string if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order, or the lexicographically largest version of the string if `s` is already sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any values, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not persist outside of it.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set will contain all unique characters in `s`.

3. **Check for Unique Characters:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it is impossible to rearrange `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Sorting and Reversing:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character, the program proceeds to sort the string `s` and store it in `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in reverse order and stores it in `c`.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The program checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it means sorting the string in ascending order does not change it. In this case, the program prints the reverse sorted string `c` as the result.
     - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting the string in ascending order changes it. In this case, the program prints the sorted string `b` as the result.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Case 1: All characters are the same:**
  - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "NO".
- **Case 2: Characters are not all the same:**
  - The program generates two possible rearrangements: one in ascending order (`b`) and one in descending order (`c`).
  - If the ascending order rearrangement `b` is different from the original string `s`, it is a valid solution and is printed.
  - If the ascending order rearrangement `b` is the same as `s`, the descending order rearrangement `c` is printed, which is guaranteed to be different from `s` because `s` has at least two different characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output string `r` is different from the input string `s` when possible, and it correctly reports "NO" when it is impossible to form such a string.

### Correctness:
**True**
