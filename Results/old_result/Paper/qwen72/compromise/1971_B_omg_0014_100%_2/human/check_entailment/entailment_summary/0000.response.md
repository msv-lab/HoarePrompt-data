Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading a string `s`.

2. **Unique Character Check**:
   - The program checks if the string `s` consists of only one unique character by converting `s` to a set `a` and checking the length of `a`. If `len(a) == 1`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to rearrange a string with only one unique character to form a different string.

3. **String Rearrangement**:
   - If the string `s` has more than one unique character, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` in ascending order to get `b` and in descending order to get `c`.
   - The program checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If `b == s`, it prints the sorted string `c` (which is the lexicographically largest version of `s`). Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b` (which is the lexicographically smallest version of `s`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct format for each test case: 'NO' if the string cannot be rearranged, or 'YES' followed by a valid rearranged string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the string `s` is already sorted in ascending order by providing the lexicographically largest version of the string.
   - It also handles the case where the string `s` is already sorted in descending order by providing the lexicographically smallest version of the string.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints: the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, and the length of each string `s` is at most 10.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
