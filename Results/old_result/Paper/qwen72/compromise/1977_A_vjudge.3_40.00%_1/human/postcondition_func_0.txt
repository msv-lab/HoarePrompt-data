The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input. The function then prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the following conditions for each pair: if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is `n - 1`, or if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the values of `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop, and `t` will remain unchanged.
