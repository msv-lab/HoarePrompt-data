Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format, converts it to 12-hour format, and prints the result with 'AM' or 'PM' as required. The logic for converting the hour from 24-hour to 12-hour format is mostly correct, but there is a small issue in the handling of the `day` variable. Specifically, the `day` variable is reset to 'AM' at the beginning of each test case, which is unnecessary and can be misleading. However, this does not affect the correctness of the output because the `day` variable is correctly updated based on the hour value.

The program correctly handles:
- Hours from 00 to 11 as 'AM'.
- Hours from 12 to 23 as 'PM'.
- The special case where the hour is 00, converting it to 12:00 AM.
- The special case where the hour is 12, keeping it as 12:00 PM.

However, the program could be improved by initializing the `day` variable inside the loop to avoid unnecessary resets. Despite this, the program produces the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
