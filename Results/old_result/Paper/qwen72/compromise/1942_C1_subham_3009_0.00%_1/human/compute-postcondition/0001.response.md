The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases to be processed. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be part of a larger solution that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers, `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the number of sides of a regular polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and `y` is always 0. The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function should return the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
