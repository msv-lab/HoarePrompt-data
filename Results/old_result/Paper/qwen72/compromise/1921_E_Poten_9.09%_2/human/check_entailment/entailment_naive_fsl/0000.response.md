Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific case where the program fails is when the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that they are in the same column but not the same row, and the number of rows between them is odd. In such a case, Alice should be able to win by moving directly down to meet Bob, but the program incorrectly determines it as a draw.

Example input:
```
1
5 5 2 3 4 3
```
Expected output:
```
Alice
```
Actual output:
```
Draw
```
This is because the program incorrectly assumes that if the row difference is even, Bob can always win or force a draw, and if it's odd, Alice can always win or force a draw, without considering the specific positions and the optimal moves that can lead to a win.
