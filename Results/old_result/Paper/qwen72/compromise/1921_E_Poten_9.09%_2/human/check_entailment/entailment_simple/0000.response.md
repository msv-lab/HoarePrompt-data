### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `test_cases`, and initializes an empty list `answers` to store the results.
   - For each test case, the function reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **First Condition:**
   - If `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
     - This is correct because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, or the board has only one row, neither player can move to the other's position, and the game will end in a draw.

3. **Second Condition:**
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` are both even or both odd:
     - If `y_a == y_b`, the function appends 'Bob' to `answers`.
       - This is correct because if both players are in the same column and their rows are both even or both odd, Bob can always move to Alice's position on his turn.
     - If `y_a < y_b`:
       - If `abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`:
         - If `y_a - 1 >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_b - y_a >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance between the columns is more than 1, and Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
         - Otherwise, the function appends 'Bob' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Bob can always catch Alice.
       - If `y_a - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_b - y_a > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
       - Otherwise, the function appends 'Bob' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Bob can always catch Alice.
     - If `y_a > y_b`:
       - If `abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`:
         - If `w - y_a >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_a - y_b >= abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance between the columns is more than 1, and Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
         - Otherwise, the function appends 'Bob' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Bob can always catch Alice.
       - If `w - y_a - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_a - y_b - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
       - Otherwise, the function appends 'Bob' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Bob can always catch Alice.

4. **Third Condition:**
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` are not both even or both odd:
     - If `y_a == y_b`, the function appends 'Alice' to `answers`.
       - This is correct because if both players are in the same column and their rows are not both even or both odd, Alice can always move to Bob's position on her turn.
     - If `y_a < y_b`:
       - If `abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`:
         - If `w - y_b > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_b - y_a > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance between the columns is more than 1, and Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
         - Otherwise, the function appends 'Alice' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Alice can always catch Bob.
       - If `w - y_b - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_b - y_a - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
       - Otherwise, the function appends 'Alice' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Alice can always catch Bob.
     - If `y_a > y_b`:
       - If `abs(y_a - y_b) > 1`:
         - If `y_b - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_a - y_b > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance between the columns is more than 1, and Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
         - Otherwise, the function appends 'Alice' to `answers`.
           - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Alice can always catch Bob.
       - If `y_b - 1 - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)` or `y_a - y_b - 1 > abs((x_a - x_b) // 2)`, the function appends 'Draw' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if Alice can move to a position where Bob cannot catch her, the game will end in a draw.
       - Otherwise, the function appends 'Alice' to `answers`.
         - This is correct because if the distance is less than or equal to 1, Alice can always catch Bob.

5. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `answers`.
