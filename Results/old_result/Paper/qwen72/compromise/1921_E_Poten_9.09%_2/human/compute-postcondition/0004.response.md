The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`. For the loop to execute, `answers` must be a non-empty list. The state of `j` will be set to the first element of `answers` at the start of the loop.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the results of the loop for each test case, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `answers` must have at least one element, `j` is the first element of `answers`**
