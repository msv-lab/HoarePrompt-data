### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It then iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive) using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` by verifying if `x % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The goal is to find the maximum balance, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
- The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is maximized when the sub-problems have the same difficulty, which is the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems.
- The program correctly checks all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest possible divisor that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems.
- The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the divisor can be used to create `n` sub-problems.

### Example Test Cases:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`:
  - The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
  - The largest divisor that can be used to create 3 sub-problems is 2 (since 10 // 2 = 5, and 5 >= 3).
  - Therefore, the output is 2, which is correct.

- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`:
  - The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.
  - The only way to create 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1 (since 5 // 5 = 1, and 1 <= 5).
  - Therefore, the output is 1, which is correct.

- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`:
  - The divisors of 420 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, and 420.
  - The largest divisor that can be used to create 69 sub-problems is 6 (since 420 // 6 = 70, and 70 >= 69).
  - Therefore, the output is 6, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the maximum balance for the given problem and handles the test cases as expected.
