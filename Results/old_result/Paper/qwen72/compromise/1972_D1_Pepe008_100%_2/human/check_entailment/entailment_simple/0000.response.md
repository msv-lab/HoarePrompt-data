Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided program and check if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
  \[
  a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}
  \]
  This means:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
  \]
  for some integer \(k\).

- The program's logic for calculating \(x\) and the additional conditions are not directly aligned with the problem's requirement. The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) and the checks \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) do not seem to directly relate to the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case \((1, 1)\):
  - The only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).
  - The program calculates \(x = (1 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 2\).
  - It adds 2 to `suma` and then subtracts 2, resulting in 0, which is incorrect.

- For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\):
  - The valid pairs are \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\).
  - The program's logic does not correctly identify these pairs, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) does not align with the problem's requirements. The conditions and the formula used in the program are not correct for determining the pairs that satisfy \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

Correctness: **False**
