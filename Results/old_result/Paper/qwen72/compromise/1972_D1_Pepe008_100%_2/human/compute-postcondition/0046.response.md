Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `suma` is 0, `x` is calculated as `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1` which simplifies to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is assigned the value `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`.
- This further simplifies to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
