The loop head contains the variables `i`, `b`, and implicitly the range defined by `1` to `b + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and the condition that allows the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `b + 1`
- `b` is a non-negative integer (since `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `1` to `b + 1`. Since `i` is currently `b + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `b + 2`. However, the loop will only execute if `i` is less than or equal to `b + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `b + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `b + 2` must be less than or equal to `b + 1`, which is not possible. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

However, if we are to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the next value of `i` will be `b + 1 + 1 = b + 2`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 2`, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**

But since the loop will not execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration is effectively the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, with `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 2`**
