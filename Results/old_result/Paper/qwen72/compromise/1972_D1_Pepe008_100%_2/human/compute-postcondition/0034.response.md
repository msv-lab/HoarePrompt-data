Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` has been evaluated and added to `suma`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but the variable `suma` is now equal to the value of `x`, which is calculated as `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. The expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` has been evaluated and its result added to `suma`. The value of `x` is the same as the result of this expression. All other variables retain their initial values.
