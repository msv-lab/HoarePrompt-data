Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `suma` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + 1`, `x` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suma` is incremented by 1.
- The previous value of `suma` was `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, so after the increment, `suma` becomes `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
