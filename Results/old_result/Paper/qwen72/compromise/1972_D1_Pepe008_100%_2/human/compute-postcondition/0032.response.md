Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `x` is calculated as `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1` which simplifies to `a // 1 + 1` and thus `x` is `a + 1`.**
