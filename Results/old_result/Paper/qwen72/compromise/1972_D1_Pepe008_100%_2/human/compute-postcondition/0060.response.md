Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it.
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
- Since `suma` was initially 0, after the addition, `suma` becomes equal to `x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `info`) remain unchanged.
