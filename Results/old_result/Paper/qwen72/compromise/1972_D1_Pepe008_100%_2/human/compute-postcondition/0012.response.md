Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`. If the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is true, then `x` is updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.***
