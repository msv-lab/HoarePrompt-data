Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `suma` is 0. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`.***
