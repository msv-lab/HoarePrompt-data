Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, and `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2) // 2`.
- `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it, so `suma` is now equal to `(a - 2) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
