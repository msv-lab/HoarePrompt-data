The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` being less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `T` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least `b`, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
