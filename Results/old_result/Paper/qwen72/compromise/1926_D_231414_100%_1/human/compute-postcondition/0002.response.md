To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a_1, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `times` is an input integer
- `check` is 2147483647

The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `times`. For the loop to execute at least once, `times` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_1, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
