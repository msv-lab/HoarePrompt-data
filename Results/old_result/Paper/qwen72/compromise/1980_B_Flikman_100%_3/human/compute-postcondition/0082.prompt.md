Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run, `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, all these conditions are retained. If `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, all these conditions are also retained, and if `removed_count` is 0, the program retains all these conditions. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not 0, and the program retains all these conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, no further changes are made. If `removed_count` is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run, `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, `removed_count` remains equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `favorite_count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
