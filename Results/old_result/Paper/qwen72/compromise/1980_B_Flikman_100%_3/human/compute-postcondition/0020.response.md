Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
4. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
6. `sorted_a` is a new list containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order.
7. `i` is `k - 1`.
8. `k` is the number of iterations the loop will run.
9. `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
10. `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
11. The current value of `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
- The condition that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count` implies that all occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a` are within the first `k` elements. However, this condition does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
