Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, and `sz` is still 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the first element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is a valid element from `rdb`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element in the list `rdb`)**
