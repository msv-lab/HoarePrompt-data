Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` starting from index 1 to `n - 1` where the element at the current index is equal to the element at the previous index.
- All other variables (`sng`, `ldb`, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt`) will remain unchanged.
