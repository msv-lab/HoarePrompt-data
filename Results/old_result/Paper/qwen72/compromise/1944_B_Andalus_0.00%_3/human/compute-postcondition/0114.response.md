The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least three elements, the loop can execute one more time for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `sng`, and `sz` is `sz + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` will be the third element of `sng`, and `sz` will be `sz + 2` but still less than `k`.

State: **`sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element of `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 2` and still less than `k`**
