The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[2]`. Additionally, if `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` also contains the value of `rgt[1]` (which is equal to `rgt[0]`), otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.**
