The only objects in the loop head are variables `elem` and the list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `rdb`.

State: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is now either 0 or 2, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 2 and the difference between `k` and `sz` is now greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.**
