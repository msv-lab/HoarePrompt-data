Output State: **`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as input integers, along with the unchanged conditions for `sng`, `sz`, and `T`.
