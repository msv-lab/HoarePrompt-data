Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 1 element.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the first element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 1 element.

Given that `ldb` has at least one element, `elem` will be the first element of `ldb`. Since `ldb` is a list of elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `elem` will be one such element.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the first element in the list ldb)**
