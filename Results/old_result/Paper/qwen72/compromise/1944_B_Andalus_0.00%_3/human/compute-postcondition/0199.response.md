Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
3. `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements.
4. `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k + len(sng)`.
5. `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
6. `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k`. If `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`, then `elem` is the last element in `sng`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print()
```

### Analysis:
- The `print()` statement is called with no arguments.
- When `print()` is called with no arguments, it simply prints a newline character.

### Output:
The `print()` statement will print a newline character.
Output: **(a newline character)**
