Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list and `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration. `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed. `n` is an input integer greater than 3. `k` is an input integer. `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user. `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order. `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order. `rdb` is an empty list. `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
