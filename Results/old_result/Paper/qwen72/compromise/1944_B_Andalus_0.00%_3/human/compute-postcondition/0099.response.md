Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted.
- `sz` is now either 0 or 4.
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least 3 elements.
- `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 4 and the difference between `k` and `sz` is now greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: The value of `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`. Since `rdb` is guaranteed to have at least 3 elements, `elem` is well-defined.
2. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Possible Values:
- Since `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, it will be printed twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] [elem] **

Where `[elem]` is the value of the third element in the list `rdb`.
