The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` does not include `n` itself). The initial state of `i` is 1, as the loop will start with `i` equal to 1.

State: **`sng` is an empty list, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
