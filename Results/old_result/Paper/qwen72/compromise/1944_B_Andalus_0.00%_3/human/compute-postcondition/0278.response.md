Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.**

Natural language description:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is now `n - 1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1.
- The list `rdb` has been populated with elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements in `rgt`. If there were no such duplicates, `rdb` remains empty.
- All other variables (`sng`, `ldb`, `sz`, `T`, `lst`, `lft`, `elem`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
