Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist).
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` and otherwise `sz` remains 2.
   - `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `rdb` contains the values of `rgt[i]` for all `i` where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements and must have at least 3 elements.

Since `ldb` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. However, the exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its position in `ldb`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, the output will be `elem` and `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list ldb)**
