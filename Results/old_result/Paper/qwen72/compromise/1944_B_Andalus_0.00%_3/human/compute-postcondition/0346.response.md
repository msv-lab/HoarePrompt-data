Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times. `sng` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. The loop or if statement we were directly inside has been exited.**

Explanation:
- `sz` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
