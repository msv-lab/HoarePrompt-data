Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, followed by the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`, and `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`.**
