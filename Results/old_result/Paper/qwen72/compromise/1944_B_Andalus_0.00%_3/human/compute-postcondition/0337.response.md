Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `sz` is 2 or 4 depending on the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2.
   - `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in `rdb`.
   - `rdb` is a list that contains at least 3 elements, and these elements are duplicates of their previous elements in `rgt`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and `rdb` contains duplicates of their previous elements, the third element will be the same as the second element, and the second element will be the same as the first element.
   - Therefore, `elem` will be the same as the first element of `rdb`.

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the third element of `rdb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list `rdb`)**

Since `rdb` is a list of duplicates, `elem` will be the same as the first element of `rdb`. However, without the exact values of `rdb`, we can only describe it in terms of the list.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list `rdb` and `rdb` contains at least 3 elements that are duplicates of their previous elements in `rgt`)**
