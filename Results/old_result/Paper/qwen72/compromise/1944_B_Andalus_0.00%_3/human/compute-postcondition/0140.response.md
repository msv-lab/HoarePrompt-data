The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `sng` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`. We need to determine the new state of `sng` after the code is executed.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`.
   - `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration.
   - `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list.
   - `rdb` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list.
   - If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lft` to `sng`.

3. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `sng` is either an empty list or a list containing `lft[2]`.
   - `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`.

4. **Calculate the Result**:
   - Since `i` is 2, the element `lft[2]` is appended to `sng`.
   - If `sng` was initially an empty list, it will now contain `lft[2]`.
   - If `sng` initially contained `lft[2]`, it will now contain `lft[2]` twice.

5. **Output State**:
   - `sng` now contains the element `lft[2]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sng` contains the element `lft[2]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2.**
