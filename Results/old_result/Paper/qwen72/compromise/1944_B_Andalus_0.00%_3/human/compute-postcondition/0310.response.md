Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not known from the initial state, but we know it is the next element in the iterable `sng`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the iterable sng)**
