Postcondition: ***`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list and `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration. `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed. `n` is an input integer greater than 3. `k` is an input integer. `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user. `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order. `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order. `rdb` is an empty list. `i` is 3.***
