Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted.
- `sz` is now either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is set to 2 and the difference between `k` and `sz` is now greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).
- `elem` is explicitly defined as the second element in the list `rdb`.

### Output:
- Since `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, the `print` statement will output this value twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element in the list `rdb`)**
