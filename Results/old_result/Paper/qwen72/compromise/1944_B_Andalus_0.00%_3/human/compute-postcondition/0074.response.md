The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`sng` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
