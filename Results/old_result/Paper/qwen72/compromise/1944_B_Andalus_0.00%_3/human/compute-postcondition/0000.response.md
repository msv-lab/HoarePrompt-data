Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters: an integer `n` and an integer `k`, where `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4` and `1 <= k <= floor(n / 2)`. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length `2n` containing integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice. `T` is an input integer.**
