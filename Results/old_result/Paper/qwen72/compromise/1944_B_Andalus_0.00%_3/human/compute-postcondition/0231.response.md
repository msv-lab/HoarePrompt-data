To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This means `i` is the last index of the list `lft` if `n` is the length of `lft`.
2. **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that `lft` has at least two elements.
3. **`sng` is a non-empty list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist)**: This means `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their immediate context.
4. **`ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements**: This means `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that are duplicates of their immediate preceding elements.
5. **`sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus 1**: This is a bit complex. Let's break it down:
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is already even, `sz` will be `k + 1`.
   - If `k` is odd, `sz` will be `k + 2`.
   - However, `sz` is also constrained by the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2. If `2 * len(rdb)` is smaller than the calculated `sz`, then `sz` will be `2 * len(rdb) + 1`.
6. **`T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified and retain their initial values.
7. **`elem` is the next element in `sng`**: This means `elem` is the next element to be processed from the list `sng`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`, the output will be the next unique element from `lft` that meets the criteria for `sng`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the next unique element from `lft` that is not equal to its immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist). Since the exact values of `lft` and `sng` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the list `sng`, which contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements)**
