To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. The loop will execute if `sng` has at least one element. The state of `sz` and `rdb` are not directly part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted here. However, the description provides important context about the conditions under which the loop operates.

Given the state:
- `sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted.
- `sz` is now either 0, 2, or 4.
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least enough elements to allow the loop to run until `sz` reaches `k` or the list is exhausted.
- `sz` will be the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration.
- If `k` is reached, the loop breaks.
- If `rdb` is exhausted before `sz` reaches `k`, `sz` will be the last even number added before the list ended.

For the loop to execute, `sng` must have at least one element. The variable `elem` will be the first element of `sng`.

State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`**
