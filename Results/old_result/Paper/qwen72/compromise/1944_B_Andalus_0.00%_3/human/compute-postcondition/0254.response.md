Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[1]`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is now 1, an odd number, or `k` if `k` is reached first), `T` is unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
