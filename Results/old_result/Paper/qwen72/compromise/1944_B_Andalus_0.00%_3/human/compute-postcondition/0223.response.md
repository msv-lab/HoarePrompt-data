Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a non-empty list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller), `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `rdb` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`). Additionally, the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
