The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `m` after converting them to integers.

- The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and `t` must be greater than 0. These variables are not affected by the code snippet.
- The new variables `n` and `m` are introduced and assigned the values from the input.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `_` and `t`, and the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers.**
