Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 0. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions.***
