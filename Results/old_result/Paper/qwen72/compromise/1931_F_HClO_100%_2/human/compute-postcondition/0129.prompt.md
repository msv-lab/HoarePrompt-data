Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is m-3, m is greater than 2, a3 is the first integer from the new input, l3 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, val is a list containing m-2 tuples, each tuple consisting of (a3, l3) from each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as expected.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the second tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least two tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the third tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least three tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
