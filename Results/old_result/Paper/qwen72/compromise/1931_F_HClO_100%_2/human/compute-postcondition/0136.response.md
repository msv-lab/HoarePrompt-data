The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is `m-2`
- `m` is at least 3
- `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`
- `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- If `m` is 1, one line of input has been consumed and the current iteration of the loop ends immediately.

After executing the code:
- `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the input.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
