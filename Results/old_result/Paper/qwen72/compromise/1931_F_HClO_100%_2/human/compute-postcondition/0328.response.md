Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the conditions were met, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking early.**

Explanation:
- The initial conditions (`m > 2`, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, the program prints 'yes', etc.) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, and during each iteration, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, `p1` and `p2` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered.
- Similarly, `idx1` and `idx2` will be either -1 (if no conditions were met) or the index where the conditions were met.
- The loop completes when `i` reaches `n - 1`, meaning all iterations have been executed.
