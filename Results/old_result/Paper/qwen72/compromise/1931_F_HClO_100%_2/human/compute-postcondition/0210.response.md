Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, then `idx2` is set to `n-2`. If `idx1` was initially -1 and `idx2` was a non-negative integer, then `idx1` is set to `n-2`, `idx2` remains a non-negative integer, and `p2` is set to 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1` was true for any `i`, then `idx2` is set to that `i` value, and `p2` is set to 1. If none of the conditions involving `l1[i + p1] == a2` were met throughout the loop, `idx1` remains -1, and `p1` remains 0. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) retain their initial values. `val` is now an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`. `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`.
- This operation modifies the list `l2` by inserting `a2` at the position `idx1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
