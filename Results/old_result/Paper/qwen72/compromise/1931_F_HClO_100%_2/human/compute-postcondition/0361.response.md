Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` is the first integer from the third user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `idx2` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The line `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- All other variables (`m`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2`) remain unchanged.
- The updated values for `a3` and `l3` are now based on the third user input.
