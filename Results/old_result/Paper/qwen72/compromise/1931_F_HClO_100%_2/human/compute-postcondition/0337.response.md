The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Given that `idx1` is `n - 2`, the value of `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the index `n - 2`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at the index `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`m`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input with `a2` inserted at index `n - 2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is less than `idx2`.**
