Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the second tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least two tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
