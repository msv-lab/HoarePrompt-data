The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state where `m` must be greater than 2, the execution of the code snippet does not affect the value of `m`. However, it introduces new variables `a3` and `l3` with values derived from the input.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
