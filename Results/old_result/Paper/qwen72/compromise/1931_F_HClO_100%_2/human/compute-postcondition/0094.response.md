The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- _ is 0
- t is greater than 0
- n is greater than 1
- m is an input integer
- a1 is the first integer from the input
- l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- a2 is the first integer from the new input
- l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2
- l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1
- i is n-2
- idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1
- p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0
- val is an empty list
- If m == 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement
- If idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1, then idx2 is set to n-2, and idx1 remains a non-negative integer
- idx1 is less than or equal to idx2

After executing the code:
- `a3` is assigned the first integer from the new input.
- `l3` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the new input.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m is an input integer, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1, p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is an empty list, a3 is the first integer from the new input, l3 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. If m == 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. If idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1, then idx2 is set to n-2, and idx1 remains a non-negative integer. idx1 is less than or equal to idx2.**
