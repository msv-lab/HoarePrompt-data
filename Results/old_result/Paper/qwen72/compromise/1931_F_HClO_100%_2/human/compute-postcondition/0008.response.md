The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`.

- `_` remains 0.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` remain as input integers.
- `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the input.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
