The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This operation modifies the list `l2` and does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `i` is `n-2`
- `idx1` and `idx2` are either non-negative or -1
- `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or 0
- `val` is an empty list
- If `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx2` is set to `n-2`, and `idx1` remains a non-negative integer. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`.

After executing the code:
- `l2` now contains the value `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, m are input integers, a1 is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the input, a2 is the first integer from the new input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding a1, i is n-2, idx1 and idx2 are either non-negative or -1 (with idx2 set to n-2 if idx2 was -1 and idx1 is non-negative), p1 and p2 are either 1 or 0, val is an empty list.**
