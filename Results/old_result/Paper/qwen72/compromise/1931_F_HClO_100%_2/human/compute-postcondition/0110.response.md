Output State: **`_` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- The previous values of `_` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The variable `a3` is updated to the first integer from the new input.
- The variable `l3` is updated to a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- The variable `val` is updated to include the new tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents.
