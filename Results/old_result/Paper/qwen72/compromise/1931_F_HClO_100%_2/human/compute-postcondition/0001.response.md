To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the variable `_` and `t` as they are the only elements in the loop head.

- The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop to iterate over the range of `t`.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` will start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
