Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either non-negative or -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and the current value of `idx1` is greater than the current value of `idx2`, `l` is now equal to `l1`.**
