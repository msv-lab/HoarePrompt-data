The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m` and the current value of `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold true, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `m - 2` must be greater than 1).

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 1**
