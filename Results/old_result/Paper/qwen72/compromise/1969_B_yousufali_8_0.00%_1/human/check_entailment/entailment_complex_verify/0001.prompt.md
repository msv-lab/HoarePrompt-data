You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, but it assumes that the input is a binary string provided through the standard input, which is converted to a list of integers.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:

        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` remains the same, `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
    #   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a binary string from the standard input, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans` based on the pattern of 1s and 0s in the list. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0, where `n` is the count of consecutive 1s in that sequence. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The list `s` remains unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2. The function reads an integer t from the input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and iterates t times, calling func_1 in each iteration.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and `func_1` has been called `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and calls the function `func_1` `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function completes. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a binary string `s` and need to determine the minimum cost to sort it in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process a single binary string.
   - It reads the input string, converts it to a list of integers, and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string, and for each character:
     - If the character is `1`, it increments `n`.
     - If the character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
     - The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. The input is a single binary string, not a space-separated list of integers. It should be `s = list(map(int, input()))`.
   - **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
     - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a `0` after seeing at least one `1`. This does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
     - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s. This can be done by finding the position of the last `0` and the first `1` and calculating the cost based on their positions.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, find the position of the last `0` and the first `1`.
   - The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the substring from the first `1` to the last `0` (inclusive).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to issues in input parsing and the logic for calculating the minimum cost.

### Correctness:
**False**
