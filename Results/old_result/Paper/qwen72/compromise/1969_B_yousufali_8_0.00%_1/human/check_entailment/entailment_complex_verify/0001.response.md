### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. The input is a single binary string, not a space-separated list of integers. The correct line should be `s = list(map(int, input()))`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a `0` after seeing at least one `1`. This does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, is to find the position of the last `0` and the first `1` and calculate the cost based on their positions. The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the substring from the first `1` to the last `0` (inclusive).

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - However, the annotations do not address the logical flaws in the cost calculation, which is a critical part of the program's correctness.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For the input `10`, the correct output is `2`. The program's current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost.
     - For the input `0000`, the correct output is `0`. The program's current logic would correctly output `0` because there are no `1`s.
     - For the input `11000`, the correct output is `9`. The program's current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost.
     - For the input `101011`, the correct output is `5`. The program's current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost.
     - For the input `01101001`, the correct output is `11`. The program's current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to issues in input parsing and the logic for calculating the minimum cost.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
