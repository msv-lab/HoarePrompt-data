### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a binary string `s` and need to determine the minimum cost to sort it in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process a single binary string.
   - It reads the input string, converts it to a list of integers, and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string, and for each character:
     - If the character is `1`, it increments `n`.
     - If the character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
     - The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. The input is a single binary string, not a space-separated list of integers. It should be `s = list(map(int, input()))`.
   - **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
     - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a `0` after seeing at least one `1`. This does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
     - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to move all `1`s to the right of all `0`s. This can be done by finding the position of the last `0` and the first `1` and calculating the cost based on their positions.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, find the position of the last `0` and the first `1`.
   - The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the substring from the first `1` to the last `0` (inclusive).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to issues in input parsing and the logic for calculating the minimum cost.

### Correctness:
**False**
