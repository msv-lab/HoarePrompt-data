### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the input handling in `func_1` is flawed. The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is intended to split a string by whitespace. However, the input is a binary string without spaces, so this will result in `s` being a list containing a single integer, which is incorrect.
   - The correct way to read the binary string would be `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` to convert each character of the string to an integer and store it in a list.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The function `func_1` increments `ans` by `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0, but this does not correctly account for the cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string.
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves identifying the positions where the string changes from 1 to 0 and calculating the minimum cost based on these transitions. Specifically, the cost to sort the string is the length of the longest contiguous segment of 1s that needs to be moved to the end of the string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is already sorted (like "0000" or "1111"), the cost should be 0, but the current logic does not account for this.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the string is a single segment of 1s followed by 0s or vice versa, which should also have a cost of 0.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the positions where the string changes from 1 to 0.
- Calculate the minimum cost as the length of the longest segment of 1s that needs to be moved to the end of the string.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    max_gap = 0
    current_gap = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 1:
            current_gap += 1
        else:
            max_gap = max(max_gap, current_gap)
            current_gap = 0
    
    # Check the last segment
    max_gap = max(max_gap, current_gap)
    
    # If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0
    if max_gap == 0:
        cost = 0
    else:
        # The cost is the length of the longest segment of 1s
        cost = max_gap + 1
    
    print(cost)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with input handling and the logic for calculating the minimum cost.
- The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
