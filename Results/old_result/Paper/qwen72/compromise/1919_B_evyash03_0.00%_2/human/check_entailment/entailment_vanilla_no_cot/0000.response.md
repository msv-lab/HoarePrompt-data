Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is attempting to count the number of times the balance (sum of elements in the array) goes negative and then adds 1 if the final balance is positive. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty (sum of penalties of all subarrays) is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to split the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, and ideally, each subarray should have a sum of zero if possible.

Here's a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the balance at each position**: Track the cumulative sum (balance) as you iterate through the string.
2. **Split the array optimally**: Whenever the balance returns to zero, you can split the array at that point to ensure the penalty of that subarray is zero.
3. **Handle remaining balance**: If there are remaining elements that do not form a subarray with a sum of zero, the penalty will be the absolute value of the remaining balance multiplied by the length of the remaining subarray.

Let's correct the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))

def min_penalty(expression):
    balance = 0
    penalty = 0
    subarray_length = 0
    
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        subarray_length += 1
        
        if balance == 0:
            penalty += 0  # Penalty for a subarray with sum 0 is 0
            subarray_length = 0  # Reset subarray length
        elif subarray_length > 1:
            penalty += abs(balance) * subarray_length
            subarray_length = 0  # Reset subarray length
            balance = 0  # Reset balance for the next subarray
    
    if subarray_length > 0:
        penalty += abs(balance) * subarray_length  # Add penalty for the last subarray if any
    
    return penalty
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for each test case.
