Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the problem's requirements. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones up to each house. This is done using the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains the count of zeros and ones up to the `i-1`-th house.

3. **Condition Checking**: For each possible position `i` to place the road, the program checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides of the road meets the required condition:
   - On the left side, at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) residents should want to live on the left side.
   - On the right side, at least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) residents should want to live on the right side.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference \(\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|\) while satisfying the conditions. If multiple positions have the same minimum difference, it outputs the smaller one.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the optimal position for each test case.

The program is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
