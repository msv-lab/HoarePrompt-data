The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the loop has executed `func_1()` a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. The variables in the function signature remain unchanged as they are not used within the function.
