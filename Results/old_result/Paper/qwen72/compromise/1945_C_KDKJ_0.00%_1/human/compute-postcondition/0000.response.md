The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input provided by the user must be converted to an integer that is greater than 0. This ensures that the loop will run at least once. Since the function does not use any variables from the function signature and the loop is controlled by the user input, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
