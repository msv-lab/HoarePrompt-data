Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the index `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) in the string `a` such that the number of '0's in the left part of the string (from the start up to the `i-1`-th character) is at least half the total characters in that part, and the number of '1's in the right part of the string (from the `i`-th character to the end) is at least half the total characters in that part. The function prints the index `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies these conditions, or prints 0 if no such index exists. **
