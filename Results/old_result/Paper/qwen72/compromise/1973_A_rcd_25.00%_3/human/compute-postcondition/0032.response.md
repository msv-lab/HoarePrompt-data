Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**

Explanation:
- The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` based on user input.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- After the code execution, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are now the input integers, and the sum of these new values is still odd, as the input is expected to maintain this condition.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
