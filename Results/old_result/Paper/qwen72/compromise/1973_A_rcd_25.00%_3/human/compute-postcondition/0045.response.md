Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`***.
