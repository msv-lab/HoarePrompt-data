Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the function prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it calculates a value based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` or `p2` and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0. **
