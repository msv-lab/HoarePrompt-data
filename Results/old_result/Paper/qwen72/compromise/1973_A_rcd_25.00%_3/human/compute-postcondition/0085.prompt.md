Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `high + 1` or the value of `low` where the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is never true, the loop does not execute, and the output is `p3`. If the loop condition is true and the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop condition is true but the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is never met, the loop completes, and the output is `p3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is true and `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` at any point, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and break. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` and the loop will print `p3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop did not break, `cur` is equal to `high + 1` and the value `p3` is printed. If the loop broke, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was met, and the value `p1 - cur + p3` was printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
