To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `p1` and `p3` are directly mentioned in the print statement.
   - `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value or context.

3. **Inference:**
   - Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, it must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume `cur` is a variable that is defined and has a value that can be subtracted from `p1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` will be evaluated.
   - `p1` and `p3` are known integers.
   - `cur` is an integer that is defined in the code but not in the initial state.

Given the initial state and the variables involved, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are input integers, and cur is an integer defined in the code)**

This output reflects the exact values of `p1` and `p3` and the value of `cur` as it is defined in the code.
