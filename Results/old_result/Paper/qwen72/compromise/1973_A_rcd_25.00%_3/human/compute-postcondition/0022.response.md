The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was either `low` or `low + 1`, so the new value of `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.**
