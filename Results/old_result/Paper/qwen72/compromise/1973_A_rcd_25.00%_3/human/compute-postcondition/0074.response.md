Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 2.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
6. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
7. `cur` is `low + 1`.
8. `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Calculate `cur`:**
   - `cur` is `low + 1`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. This condition ensures that `cur` is a valid value within the range defined by `low` and `high`.

4. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` needs to be evaluated.
   - Substitute `cur` with `low + 1`:
     \[
     p1 - (low + 1) + p3
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     p1 - low - 1 + p3
     \]

5. **Substitute `low` with its definition:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - There are two cases to consider:
     - Case 1: `low = p3 - p1`
     - Case 2: `low = p3 - p2`

### Case 1: `low = p3 - p1`
- Substitute `low` in the expression:
  \[
  p1 - (p3 - p1) - 1 + p3
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  p1 - p3 + p1 - 1 + p3
  \]
  \[
  2p1 - 1
  \]

### Case 2: `low = p3 - p2`
- Substitute `low` in the expression:
  \[
  p1 - (p3 - p2) - 1 + p3
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  p1 - p3 + p2 - 1 + p3
  \]
  \[
  p1 + p2 - 1
  \]

### Conclusion:
- The value printed will be either `2p1 - 1` or `p1 + p2 - 1`, depending on whether `low` is `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2p1 - 1 or p1 + p2 - 1 (where `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is `low + 1`)**
