Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop did not break, `cur` is equal to `high + 1` and the value `p3` is printed. If the loop broke, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was met, and the value `p1 - cur + p3` was printed.***
