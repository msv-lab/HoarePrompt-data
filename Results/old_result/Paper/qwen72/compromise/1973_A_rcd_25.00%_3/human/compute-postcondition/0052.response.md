Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
6. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
7. `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`.
8. `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
9. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
10. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - Given that `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`, we know that the difference between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` is at least 2.

2. **Determine `cur`:**
   - `cur` is set to `low + 2` if `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the loop or if statement.

3. **Evaluate the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)`:**
   - Let's substitute `cur` with `low + 2` and simplify the condition:
     \[
     p1 - (low + 2) > p2 - (p3 - (low + 2))
     \]
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     p1 - low - 2 > p2 - p3 + low + 2
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     p1 - p2 + p3 > 2 * low + 4
     \]
   - Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, let's consider the two cases:
     - If `low = p3 - p1`, then the condition becomes:
       \[
       p1 - p2 + p3 > 2 * (p3 - p1) + 4
       \]
       \[
       p1 - p2 + p3 > 2p3 - 2p1 + 4
       \]
       \[
       3p1 - p2 - p3 > 4
       \]
     - If `low = p3 - p2`, then the condition becomes:
       \[
       p1 - p2 + p3 > 2 * (p3 - p2) + 4
       \]
       \[
       p1 - p2 + p3 > 2p3 - 2p2 + 4
       \]
       \[
       p1 + p2 - p3 > 4
       \]

4. **Determine the value of `cur`:**
   - If the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, then `cur` is set to `low + 2`.
   - If the condition is false, we break out of the loop or if statement, and `cur` is not set to `low + 2`.

5. **Calculate `p1 - cur + p3`:**
   - If `cur` is set to `low + 2`, then:
     \[
     p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - (low + 2) + p3
     \]
     \[
     p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - low - 2 + p3
     \]
   - If `cur` is not set to `low + 2` (i.e., the condition is false), then the value of `cur` is not defined, and the code snippet would not execute the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the condition, `cur` is set to `low + 2` if the condition `p1 - cur > p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true. Therefore, the value printed will be:
\[
p1 - (low + 2) + p3
\]

Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can express the final output as:
\[
p1 - \min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) - 2 + p3
\]

Output: **p1 - \min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) - 2 + p3 (where p1, p2, and p3 are input integers, and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
