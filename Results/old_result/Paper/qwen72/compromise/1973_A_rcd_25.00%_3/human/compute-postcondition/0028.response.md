Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 2` or `low + 3`.***
