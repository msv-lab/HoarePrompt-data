Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low + 1`, and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `low + 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
