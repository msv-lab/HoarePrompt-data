Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is true and `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` at any point, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and break. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` and the loop will print `p3`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `cur` is less than or equal to `high`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and terminate.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` will be incremented to `high + 1`, and the loop will print `p3`.
