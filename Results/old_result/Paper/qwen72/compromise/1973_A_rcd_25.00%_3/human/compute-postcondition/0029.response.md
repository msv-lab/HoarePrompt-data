Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `high + 1` or the value of `low` where the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true. If the loop condition `high >= cur` is never true, the loop does not execute, and the output is `p3`. If the loop condition is true and the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop condition is true but the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is never met, the loop completes, and the output is `p3`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** The variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are as given in the initial state. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` starts at `low`.
- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
  - Inside the loop, if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
  - If the condition is not met, `cur` is incremented by 1.
  - If the loop completes without breaking, the output is `p3`.
- **Final State:**
  - If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `high < low`), `cur` remains `low`, and the output is `p3`.
  - If the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is the value where this condition is true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
  - If the loop completes all iterations, `cur` is `high + 1`, and the output is `p3`.
