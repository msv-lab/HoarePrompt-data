Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are input integers, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop did not break, `cur` is equal to `high + 1`. If the loop broke, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was met, and the value `p1 - cur + p3` was printed. If the loop did not break, the value `p3` was printed.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The initial state sets up the variables `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur`.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
  - In each iteration, the loop checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
  - If this condition is true, the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks.
  - If the condition is false, `cur` is incremented by 1.
  - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints `p3`.
- **Final State**:
  - If the loop breaks, it means the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` was met at some point, and the value `p1 - cur + p3` was printed.
  - If the loop does not break, it means the condition was never met, and the loop completes by setting `cur` to `high + 1`, and the value `p3` is printed.
  - The values of `t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
