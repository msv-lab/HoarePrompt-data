### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total number of points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Score Consistency Check:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the two lower scores. This is because the highest score player could have won all the games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all their games.

4. **Draw Calculation:**
   - If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `cur` from `low` to `high`.
   - The loop condition `high >= cur` ensures that the program iterates through all possible values of `cur`.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. This is intended to find the maximum number of draws that can be consistent with the given scores.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 10`) by printing `-1`.

6. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is based on the idea that the number of draws should be maximized while ensuring the scores remain consistent.
   - The use of `low` and `high` to find the range of possible draws is a good approach, but the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` seems to be an attempt to balance the scores, which might not always be necessary.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the odd sum check and the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
- However, the logic inside the loop for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not always the correct way to determine the maximum number of draws. The correct approach should be to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores remain consistent.

### Corrected Logic:

- If the sum of the scores is odd, print `-1`.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, print `p1 + p2`.
- Otherwise, the maximum number of draws can be calculated as `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3`.

### Conclusion:

The program is **not** correct in all cases due to the flawed logic in the loop for calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
