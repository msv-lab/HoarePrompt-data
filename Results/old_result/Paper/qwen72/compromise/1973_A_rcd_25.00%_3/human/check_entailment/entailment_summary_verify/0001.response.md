### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. This is a necessary condition because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 for a win/loss and 2 for a draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total points sum is impossible.

3. **Score Consistency Check:**
   - The program then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score can be achieved entirely through draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least `p1 + p2`, it means the third player could have drawn all games with the other two players.

4. **Complex Case Handling:**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the remaining points after `cur` draws are consistent with the scores.
   - If such a value is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such value is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when no games were played (`0 0 0`) and when the scores are not consistent (`1 1 1`).

6. **Algorithmic Validity:**
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is based on the idea that the total points must be even and the highest score must be achievable through a combination of wins and draws.
   - The iterative approach to find the maximum number of draws is a bit complex but ensures that the solution is correct by checking all possible values of `cur`.

However, there is a critical issue in the complex case handling logic. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to determine the maximum number of draws. The correct condition should be based on the total number of points and the distribution of draws and wins.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program should calculate the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the remaining points after the draws can be distributed in a way that the scores are consistent.
- The correct approach is to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins and losses.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
            max_draws = total_points // 2
            if max_draws > p3:
                max_draws = p3
            print(max_draws)
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points Check:** If the total points are odd, print `-1`.
- **Score Consistency Check:** If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, print `p1 + p2`.
- **Complex Case Handling:** Calculate the maximum possible number of draws as `total_points // 2`. Ensure that the maximum number of draws does not exceed `p3`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program has a logical error in the complex case handling. The corrected code ensures that the maximum number of draws is correctly calculated and distributed. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
