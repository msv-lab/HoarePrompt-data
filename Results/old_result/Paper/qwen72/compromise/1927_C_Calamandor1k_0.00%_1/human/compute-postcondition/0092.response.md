Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is `k // 2`, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `b[1]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.***
