### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list (`data[0]`) is correctly identified as the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list `data`.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating each password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is added to the `letters` list.
   - This part correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.

3. **Tracking Last Digit Index:**
   - The program uses `last_digit_index` to keep track of the last index where a digit was found.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns `'NO'` because the password violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - This check is correct and ensures that the password meets the second condition.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - If either list is not sorted, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns `'YES'`.
   - This part correctly ensures that the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, meeting the third and fourth conditions.

5. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the output as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the input and output correctly. The function `func_1` correctly validates the password based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
