Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly verifies if a given password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the length of the password and the password itself for each test case.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for letters.
   - **Check for Digits After Letters**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Return**: If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them in the correct format.

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
