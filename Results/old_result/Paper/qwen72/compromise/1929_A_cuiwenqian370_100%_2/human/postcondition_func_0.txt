The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` with a length of at least 2. It sorts the list in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function returns this sum, which represents the "beauty" of the array. The original list `array` is modified to be sorted.
