You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with a length of at least 2.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to this function, but it reads input from stdin, expecting a formatted input as described in the problem statement.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []

        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration. `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` remains `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is unchanged (it still contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration), and `t` and `data` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, sorting the array in ascending order is not the optimal way to maximize the beauty. The optimal way is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the differences, as this will maximize the positive differences.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(array)` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and then printed one by one.

4. **Optimal Solution:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the largest elements will be placed at the beginning, and the smallest elements will be placed at the end, maximizing the positive differences.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order, which does not maximize the beauty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
