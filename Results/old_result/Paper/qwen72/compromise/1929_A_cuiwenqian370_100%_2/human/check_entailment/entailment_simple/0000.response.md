### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The key insight here is that sorting the array in ascending order will not necessarily maximize the beauty. Instead, the beauty is maximized when the array is sorted in a way that maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the differences.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is better achieved by sorting the array in descending order.
   - Therefore, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
   - The issue lies in `func_1`, not in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. Sorting the array in descending order would be the correct approach to maximize the beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**
