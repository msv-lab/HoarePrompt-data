Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing this beauty is to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The maximum difference is achieved when the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other in the array. Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, multiplied by \(n-1\) (the number of differences).

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints it. This is not the correct approach because it does not account for the sum of differences between all consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The current program does not sort the array or compute the sum of differences, so it does not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
