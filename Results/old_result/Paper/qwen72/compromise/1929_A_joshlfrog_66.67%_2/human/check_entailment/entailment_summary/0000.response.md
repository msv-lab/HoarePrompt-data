Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order, because this will maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty of the array is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.
   - It then prints the difference `x - y`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The difference `x - y` does not represent the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the maximum beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\), not \(3 - 1 = 2\).

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The expected output for the test cases should be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The program's output is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the correct solution.

Given this reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
