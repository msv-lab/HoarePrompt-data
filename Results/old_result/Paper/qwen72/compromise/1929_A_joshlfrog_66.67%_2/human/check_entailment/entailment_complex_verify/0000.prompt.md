You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the last `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the last `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (where `2 <= l <= 100`) and a list of `l` integers. The function computes and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the differences between the maximum and minimum values of each list have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The correct output should be 3, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2]. However, the program will output 3 - 1 = 2, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
