Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the last `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the last `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `e` will be `t-1` (indicating the loop has run `t` times), `l` will be the last input integer for the length of the list, `nums` will be the last list of integers input by the user, `i` will be `l-1` (indicating the last index of the last list), `x` will be the maximum value in the last `nums`, and `y` will be the minimum value in the last `nums`. The initial input constraints for `t`, `n`, and the elements of `a` remain unchanged.
