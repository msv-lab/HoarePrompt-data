Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the `nums` list to contain the integers input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged, but `x` and `y` are now based on the new values in `nums`.
