Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

The value of `x` is now 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `x` was the maximum value in `nums`, but after the code execution, `x` is explicitly set to 0. The value of `y` is still the minimum value in `nums`.
