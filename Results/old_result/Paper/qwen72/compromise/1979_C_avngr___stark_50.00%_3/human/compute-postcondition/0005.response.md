The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the third element of the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must now be the fourth element of the list `numbers`, assuming the list has at least four elements.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 4 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the first, second, and third elements of the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth element of the list `numbers`**
