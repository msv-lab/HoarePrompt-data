### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculation of Product:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all elements in the list `k`. This is done to ensure that the bets are multiples of the multipliers, which is a good approach to find a solution that satisfies the problem constraints.

3. **Calculation of Bets:**
   - The program then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`, and the amount received back for the winning outcome is `k[i] * c[i]`.

4. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This is done to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.

5. **Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints the bets. If not, it prints `-1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the bets for each test case or `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The product `m` of all elements in `k` can become very large, especially for large `n` and large values of `k[i]`. This can lead to integer overflow or performance issues.
  - Instead, we should find a way to distribute the bets such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome without necessarily calculating the product of all multipliers.

- **GCD Calculation:**
  - The GCD calculation is correct, but it is not necessary to calculate the product `m` first. We can directly find a valid distribution of bets without this step.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- One valid approach is to set the bet for each outcome to be the reciprocal of the multiplier, scaled by a common factor to ensure the bets are integers and the sum is less than the total amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly handle the distribution of bets in all cases. Specifically, the product `m` can become too large, and the GCD calculation does not necessarily ensure that the sum of the bets is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
