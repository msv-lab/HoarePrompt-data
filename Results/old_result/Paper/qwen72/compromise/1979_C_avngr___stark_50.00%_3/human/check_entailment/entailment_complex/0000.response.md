Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, you receive \( k_i \times x_i \) coins, where \( x_i \) is the amount bet on outcome \( i \).
   - The total amount bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \).
   - The condition to satisfy is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_j \times x_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the product of all \( k_i \) values and then divides this product by each \( k_i \) to get the corresponding \( x_i \).
   - This ensures that \( x_i \) is a multiple of the product of all other \( k_j \) values, which helps in ensuring that the total sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is a multiple of the product of all \( k_i \) values.
   - The program then calculates the GCD of all \( x_i \) values and divides each \( x_i \) by this GCD to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - Finally, it checks if the total sum of the reduced bets is less than the product of all \( k_i \) values divided by the GCD. If not, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The product \( m = \prod_{i=1}^{n} k_i \) ensures that each \( x_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \) is an integer.
   - The GCD of \( x_i \) values is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the condition.
   - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \frac{m}{\text{GCD}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)} \) ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all \( k_i \) values are the same, the program correctly outputs \(-1\) because the total sum of bets will be equal to the product of \( k_i \) and the GCD, which does not satisfy the condition.
   - For other cases, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the correct logic and mathematical principles to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that satisfies the problem's requirements.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required condition.

Correctness: **True**
