The value of `test_cases` is assigned the integer value of the input provided. The function `func` definition and its intended purpose remain unchanged and still lacks parameters. The constraints and the initial state regarding the function `func` are still valid.

Output State: **The function `func` is intended to solve a game problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. The correct function definition should be: `def func(h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):` where `h` and `w` are the height and width of the board, respectively, and `x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b` are the initial coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips, with the constraints: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. `test_cases` is an input integer.**
