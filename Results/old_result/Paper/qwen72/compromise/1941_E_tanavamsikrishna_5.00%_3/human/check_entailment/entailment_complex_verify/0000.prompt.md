You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    return row[-1]
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row). It modifies the list `row` by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and setting the rest of the elements (from index `d-1` to the end) to the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus 1. The last element of the list remains 0. The function always returns 0, and the value of `d` remains unchanged.

The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The following n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` with specific constraints. It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. The function calculates the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list. It computes the sum of `k` consecutive elements from this list for each possible segment and prints the minimum of these sums. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs is printed to the standard output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the cost of installing supports. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function attempts to update the cost of each cell in the row, but it does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals to meet the distance constraint.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
Here, the river grid is:
```
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
The program should find the minimum cost to build a bridge in one of the rows with the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than 2.

However, the program's `func_1` function will incorrectly compute the cost for each row. For the first row, it will update the costs as follows:
- `row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `row[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[2] = min(row[0:2]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[3] = min(row[1:3]) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[4] = min(row[2:4]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the total cost for the first row is `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9`.

However, the correct minimum cost for the first row should be `4` because the supports can be placed at positions (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5), which satisfies the distance constraint and results in a total cost of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
