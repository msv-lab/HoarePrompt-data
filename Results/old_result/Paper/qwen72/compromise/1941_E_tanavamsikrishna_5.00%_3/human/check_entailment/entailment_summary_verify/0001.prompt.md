You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from typing import List
#Function 1:
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` with specific constraints. It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. The function calculates the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list. It computes the sum of `k` consecutive elements from this list for each possible segment and prints the minimum of these sums. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs is printed to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`.
   - The function adds 1 to the cost of each cell to account for the installation cost.
   - The final cost for the row is the cost of the last cell in the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths and stores it in `rows`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and appends these sums to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case, printed on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the constraints given in the problem, such as the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have a depth of 0, as required by the problem.

6. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - The sliding window approach used in `func_2` to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the grid.

Correctness: **True**
