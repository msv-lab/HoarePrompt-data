### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports in a row while ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle this constraint.

Let's break down the issues in `func_1`:

1. **Initial Support Installation:**
   - The function correctly adds 1 to the cost of the first `d-1` cells because these cells are always within the distance constraint from the first support at `(i, 1)`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function attempts to use a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost for each cell. However, the way it calculates the minimum cost is flawed.
   - The line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. It should be `row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1` to ensure that the minimum cost is taken from the last `d` cells, not `d + 1` cells.
   - Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
The river grid is:
```
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
```
For the first row:
- `row[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `row[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[2] = min(row[0:2]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[3] = min(row[1:3]) + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `row[4] = min(row[2:4]) + 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the total cost for the first row is `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9`.

However, the correct minimum cost for the first row should be `4` because the supports can be placed at positions (1, 1), (1, 3), and (1, 5), which satisfies the distance constraint and results in a total cost of `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly handle the distance constraint, the function `func_1` should use a dynamic programming approach where the cost for each cell is calculated based on the minimum cost of the last `d` cells. The correct implementation should look something like this:

```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    dp = [0] * len(row)
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # Cost of the first support
    dp[-1] = row[-1] + 1  # Cost of the last support

    for i in range(1, len(row) - 1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1

    return dp[-1]
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
