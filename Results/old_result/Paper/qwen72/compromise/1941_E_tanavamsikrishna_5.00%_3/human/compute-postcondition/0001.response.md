Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the first line of input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers.**

Explanation:
- The code reads `n` lines of input, where each line is split into integers and stored in a list.
- The variable `rows` is now a list containing `n` lists, each with `m` integers.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged and still adhere to the given constraints.
