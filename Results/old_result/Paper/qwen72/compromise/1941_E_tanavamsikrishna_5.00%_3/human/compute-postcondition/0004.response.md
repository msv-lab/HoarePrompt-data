To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with specific constraints.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding `row` in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`.
   - This simplifies to `len(costs) >= k`.
   - Since `costs` is a list of length `n`, we need `n >= k` for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0.
- `costs` must have at least `k` elements, which means `n` must be at least `k`.

State: **`i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n` where `n` must be at least `k`**
