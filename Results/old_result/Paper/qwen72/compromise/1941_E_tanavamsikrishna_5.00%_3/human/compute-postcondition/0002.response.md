Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the first line of input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding `row` in `rows`.**
