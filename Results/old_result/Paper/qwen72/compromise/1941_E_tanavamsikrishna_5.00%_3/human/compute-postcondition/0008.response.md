The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. These integers are constrained as follows: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The following `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints that 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.

The function processes this input and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the prompt, so we cannot describe the exact return value. 

Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, consisting of four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` followed by `n` lines of `m` integers each, representing the depths of river cells. It processes this input and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships.**
