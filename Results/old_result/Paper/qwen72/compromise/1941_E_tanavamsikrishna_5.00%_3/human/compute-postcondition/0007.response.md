To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `total_costs`**:
   - `total_costs` is a list where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The length of `total_costs` is `n - (k - 1)`, which means it has `n - k + 1` elements.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be:
     - `total_costs[0] = costs[0] + costs[1] + costs[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
     - `total_costs[1] = costs[1] + costs[2] + costs[3] = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
     - `total_costs[2] = costs[2] + costs[3] + costs[4] = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`
     - So, `total_costs = [6, 9, 12]`.

2. **Finding the Minimum**:
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will return the smallest element in the `total_costs` list.
   - In the example above, `min(total_costs) = min([6, 9, 12]) = 6`.

### Final Output:
The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list, which is the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
