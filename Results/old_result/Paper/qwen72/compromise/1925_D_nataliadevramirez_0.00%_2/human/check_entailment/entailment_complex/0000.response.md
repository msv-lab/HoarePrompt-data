Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time they are chosen. The final answer should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value in its simplest form.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1**:
   - **Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of friendship pairs), `k` (number of excursions), `friendships` (list of tuples representing the friendship pairs and their initial values).
   - **Logic**:
     - The function iterates over each friendship pair and calculates the contribution of each pair to the total sum of friendship values.
     - For each friendship pair `(a, b, f)`, the contribution is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
     - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the total increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions.
     - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `MOD`.

2. **func_2**:
   - **Parameters**: None.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
     - It calls `func_1` with the test case data and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

- **Expected Value Calculation**:
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen in the excursions is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs, each multiplied by the expected number of times the pair is chosen.
  - The expected number of times a pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children.
  - However, the function `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. It simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is not the correct approach for calculating the expected value.

- **Modulo Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly uses modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers, but it does not correctly calculate the expected value.

- **Test Case Handling**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` with the appropriate data.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It should account for the probability of each pair being chosen, which is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
