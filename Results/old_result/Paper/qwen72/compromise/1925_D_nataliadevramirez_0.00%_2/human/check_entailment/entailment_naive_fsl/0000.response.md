Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the way the expected value is computed in `func_1`.

The program calculates the result as:
```python
result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
```
This formula assumes that the friendship value of each pair is incremented by 1 for each excursion, which is incorrect. The problem description states that the friendship value of a pair is incremented by 1 only if the pair is chosen in an excursion. Therefore, the expected value of the friendship value increase for each pair should take into account the probability of the pair being chosen.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected number of times each pair is chosen over k excursions, which is given by:
\[ \text{Expected number of times chosen} = k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]
where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children from n children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen is then:
\[ \text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

The provided program does not account for this probability and thus will produce incorrect results for many cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions. The correct expected value should be:
\[ \text{Expected value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]
However, the program will output:
\[ 1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times 3}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
