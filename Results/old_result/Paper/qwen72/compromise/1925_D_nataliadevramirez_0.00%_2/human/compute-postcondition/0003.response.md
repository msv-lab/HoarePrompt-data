The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains three integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5). The next `m` lines each contain three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9), representing pairs of children who are friends and their initial friendship values.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result of the computation for each test case. The exact nature of the computation is not specified, but it likely involves some form of processing or analysis based on the friendship values and the relationships between the children.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing the number of children `n`, the number of friendships `m`, and a parameter `k`. It also reads `m` lines of friendship data for each test case, each line containing the indices of two children and their friendship value. The function processes this data and returns a result for each test case.**
