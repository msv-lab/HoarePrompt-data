You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friendship pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of two children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The values of n, m, and k are such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Each a and b in the tuples satisfy 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, and each f satisfies 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `friendships` remains unchanged, `result` is the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` in `friendships` multiplied by the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, modulo `MOD`.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the value of `result % MOD`, where `result` is the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` in `friendships` multiplied by the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of children `n`, the number of friendship pairs `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendship tuples `friendships`. It returns the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` in `friendships` multiplied by `k * (k + 1) // 2`, modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `result % MOD`, where `result` is the sum of the products of each friendship value `f` in `friendships` multiplied by the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, modulo `MOD`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
