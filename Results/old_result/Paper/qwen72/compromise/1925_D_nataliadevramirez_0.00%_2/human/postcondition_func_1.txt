The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling another function `func_1` with the test case data, and prints the result of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope, and the value of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
