n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friendship pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of two children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The values of n, m, and k are such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Each a and b in the tuples satisfy 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, and each f satisfies 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9.
