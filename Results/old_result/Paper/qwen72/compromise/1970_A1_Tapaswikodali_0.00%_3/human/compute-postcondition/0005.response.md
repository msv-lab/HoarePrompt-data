Output State: **`balance` is 0, `details` is a sorted list of tuples containing `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in the string `s`, where `balance` is the current balance of parentheses, `i` is the index of the character in the string, and `char` is the character at that index.**

The `details` list is now sorted based on the tuples it contains. The sorting is done in ascending order, first by the `balance` value, then by the negative index `-i`, and finally by the character `char`. The `balance` variable remains unchanged at 0.
