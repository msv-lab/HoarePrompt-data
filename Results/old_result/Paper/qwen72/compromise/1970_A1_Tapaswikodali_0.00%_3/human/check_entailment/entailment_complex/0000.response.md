Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input string `s` correctly, which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string. The balance is incremented for each opening parenthesis `(` and decremented for each closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Details Collection**: The function collects the balance, negative index, and character for each position in the string `s` and stores them in a list `details`. The negative index is used to break ties in the sorting step, ensuring that characters with the same balance are sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.

4. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted based on the balance and then by the negative index. This sorting step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

5. **Result Construction**: The function constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them into a single string.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

The function correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The use of negative indices ensures that the sorting is done in the required order, and the final result is constructed and printed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
