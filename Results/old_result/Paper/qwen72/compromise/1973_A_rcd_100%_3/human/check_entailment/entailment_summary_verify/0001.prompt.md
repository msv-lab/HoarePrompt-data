You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the user, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30). The function then checks if the sum of these scores is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. If the sum is even and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it performs a loop to find values `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If such values are found, it prints `p1 - x + p3`; otherwise, it prints `p3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and no further state changes are made to the input variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total score must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (two draws), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the program prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two players with the lowest scores have all their points from draws. The third player can have all their points from wins or draws, but the total number of draws is limited by the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores.

4. **Balancing Draws and Wins:**
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program attempts to balance the draws and wins between the players.
   - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then iterates, decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` until `y` is less than `x`.
   - If at any point `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid balance, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (all scores are 0) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games by printing `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Odd Total Score Check:**
  - This ensures that the total points are even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid.
  - Example: `0 1 1` (total = 2, even) and `1 1 1` (total = 3, odd).

- **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
  - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the two players with the lowest scores can have all their points from draws.
  - Example: `0 1 1` (max draws = 1) and `1 1 2` (max draws = 2).

- **Balancing Draws and Wins:**
  - The loop attempts to find a balance where the points from draws and wins are consistent.
  - Example: `3 4 5` (max draws = 6) and `1 1 10` (max draws = 2).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given conditions and edge cases. It ensures that the total score is even, calculates the maximum number of draws when possible, and prints `-1` when the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

### Correctness:
**True**
