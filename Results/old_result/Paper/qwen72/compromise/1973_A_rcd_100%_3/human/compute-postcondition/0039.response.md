Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- If the sum is even and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p1`.
- If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the new input values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even**: This is a given condition in the initial state.
2. **`p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`**: This is another condition that must be satisfied for the program to proceed to setting `y` to `p1`.
3. **`p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`**: This condition determines whether the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop.

Given the conditions, let's break down the logic:
- Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program sets `y` to `p1`.
- The condition `p1 - (p3 - p1) <= p2 - (p3 - p1)` simplifies to `2 * p1 - p3 <= p2 - p3`, which further simplifies to `2 * p1 <= p2`.

If `2 * p1 <= p2` is true, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If this condition is false, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`.

However, the code snippet provided is:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

This print statement is not part of the loop logic described in the initial state. It simply prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Output:
The code snippet `print(p1 + p2)` will print the sum of the integers `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are the values of p1 and p2, respectively, and 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 30)**
