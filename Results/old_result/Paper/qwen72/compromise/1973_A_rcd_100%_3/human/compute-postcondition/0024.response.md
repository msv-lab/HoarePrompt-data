Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3 - 2`, `x` is 2, and `p3` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now equal to `p3 - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
