Postcondition: ***`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.***
