Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `x` is 1, `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The condition `p1 - x > p2 - y` is still valid because `x` was 0 and is now 1, and `y` remains equal to `p3`.
