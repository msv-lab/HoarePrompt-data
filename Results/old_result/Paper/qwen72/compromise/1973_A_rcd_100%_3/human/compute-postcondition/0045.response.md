Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `y` is `p3`, `x` is 0, and the current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
