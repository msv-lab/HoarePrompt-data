The value of `y` is assigned the value of `p3`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the sum is even and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `y` is set to `p3`. If `p1 - (p3 - p1)` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - p1)`, the function prints `p1 + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` is less than `x`, and the function prints `p3`. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the new input values. `x` is 0.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `y` is `p3`, `x` is 0.**
