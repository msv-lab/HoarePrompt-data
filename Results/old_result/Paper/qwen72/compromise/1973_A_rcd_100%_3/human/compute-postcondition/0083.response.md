Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user, where 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `x` is 2, `y` is `p3 - 1`, and `p3` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
