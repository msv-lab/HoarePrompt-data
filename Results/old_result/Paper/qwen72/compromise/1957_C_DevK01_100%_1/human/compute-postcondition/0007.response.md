The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with two elements: [3, 7], `i` is 4**
