### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the value of `n` based on the positions of the rooks.

2. **Move Processing:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row `a` and column `b` are blocked by the rooks placed at `(a, b)` and `(b, a)`.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one row (or column) is blocked by the rook placed at `(a, a)`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations using a dynamic programming approach.
   - The `dp` list is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `n`, updating the `dp` list with the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - The `dp` list is maintained with only the last two elements to save space, which is a common optimization technique in dynamic programming.
   - The final result is the second element of the `dp` list, which is returned.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Dynamic Programming Formula:
- The formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is used to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board.
- `dp[-1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an `(i-1) x (i-1)` board.
- `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` represents the number of ways to place a rook on the `i-th` row and column, considering the previous `(i-2) x (i-2)` board configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the range of a 32-bit integer.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input, updates the board size `n` based on the moves, and computes the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.
- The dynamic programming formula and the overall logic of the program are consistent with the problem description and constraints.
