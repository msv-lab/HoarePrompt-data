Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` for each test case.
   - It also reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions for placing rooks.

2. **Move Processing**:
   - The program correctly processes each move `(a, b)`. If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied. If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one position `(a, a)` is occupied.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases. This is correct because:
     - `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board).
     - `dp[2] = 1` (one way to place two rooks on a 2x2 board such that they don't attack each other).
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
     - This formula is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a board. The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` accounts for the two possible ways to place a rook in a new row and column, and `dp[-1]` accounts for the configurations where no new rook is placed.
   - The result is returned as `dp[-1]`, which is the second element in the list `dp` that contains two elements: `[dp[n-1], dp[n]]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.
   - The output is correctly formatted and modulo 10^9 + 7 is applied to handle large numbers.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is reduced to 0 or 1 correctly.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of configurations is calculated efficiently and correctly for each test case.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program's logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the state updates are correctly managed.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the moves, updates the available positions, and calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.

Final: **True**
