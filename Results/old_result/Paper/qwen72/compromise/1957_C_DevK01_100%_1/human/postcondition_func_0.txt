The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and returns the value of `dp[n]`, which is the result of a specific computation involving the previous values in the `dp` list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` remains unchanged, and the function returns the computed value `dp[n]`.
