Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 1 in the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.***
