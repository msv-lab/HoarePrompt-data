Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i - 1] - 1] == i + 1`.**

The value of `n` is updated to a new positive integer input by the user, which is within the range 1 to 5000. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
