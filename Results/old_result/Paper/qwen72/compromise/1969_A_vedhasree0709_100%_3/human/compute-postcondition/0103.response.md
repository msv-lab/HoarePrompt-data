The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the size of the list `p`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, it is likely that the function processes the list `p` in some way and returns a value or a list of values for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the size of the list `p`), and `p` (a list of `n` distinct integers, each not equal to its index and within the range 1 to n). The function processes the list `p` for each test case and returns a result based on the input.**
