Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000).
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `p` is equal to the first element of `l`.
   - `q` is equal to the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.
   - The value of `q` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `2`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
