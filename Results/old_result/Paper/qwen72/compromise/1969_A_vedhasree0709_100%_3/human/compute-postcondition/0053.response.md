Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000) and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 1 in the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
