Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i - 1] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits the loop for that test case. If no such index is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` is 0, `n` is the last input value (1 <= n <= 50), `l` is the last list of integers provided, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find the specified condition for any test case. **
