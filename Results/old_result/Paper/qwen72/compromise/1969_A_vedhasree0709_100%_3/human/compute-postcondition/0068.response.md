The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the new input value, which is converted to an integer. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is `n` and `j` is 0. However, since `_` is not part of the previous state and is only used to control the number of iterations, we need to focus on the input value that controls the loop.

At the start of the next iteration, the loop counter `_` will be incremented, but we do not need to specify its value explicitly. The key is to ensure that the loop can execute again, which means the input value must still be valid (1 <= n <= 5000) and the loop has not completed the specified number of iterations.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the current value of the loop counter, we assume that the loop is about to start a new iteration. The input value `n` remains the same, and the other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, `j`) are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i - 1] - 1] == i + 1`.**
