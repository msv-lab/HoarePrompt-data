Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is a positive integer equal to the new input value (1 <= n <= 5000), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- `n` is a positive integer equal to a new input value within the range 1 to 5000.
- `l` is initially a list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not find an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `l` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
