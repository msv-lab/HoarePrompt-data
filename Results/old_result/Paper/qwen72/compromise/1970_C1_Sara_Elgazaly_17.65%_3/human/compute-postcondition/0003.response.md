Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, and `_` is 0.
- The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `a` and `b`.
- After executing this code, `a` and `b` are now integers that were provided as input.
- The values of `x` and `_` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the initial values of `x` and `_`, and the new values of `a` and `b` as input integers.
