Output State: **`x` is the second last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `lst[x]` is not an empty list, `y` is the second last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `_` remains unchanged, `s` is now the opposite of its previous value, and the current value of `lst[y]` is not an empty list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
