Output State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` three times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` four times.** 

The code `lst[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `lst[b]`, which initially contains `a` three times. Therefore, after the execution, `lst[b]` contains `a` four times. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
