The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it is implied that the function reads input from standard input or another method outside the function. The input consists of:
- The first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t=1`.
- The next `n-1` lines containing two integers `u` and `v` each, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, representing the edges of a tree.
- The last line containing a single integer `u_1`, where `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`, representing the starting node for the round.

The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function processes this input and returns the result based on the provided constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function reads input consisting of a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`, and returns a result based on the structure of the tree and the starting node.**
