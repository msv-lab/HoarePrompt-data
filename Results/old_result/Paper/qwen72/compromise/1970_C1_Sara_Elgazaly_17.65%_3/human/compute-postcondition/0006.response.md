The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `x - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be 1, and `x` must still be an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, ensuring that `_` is less than `x - 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as one of its elements, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as one of its elements**
