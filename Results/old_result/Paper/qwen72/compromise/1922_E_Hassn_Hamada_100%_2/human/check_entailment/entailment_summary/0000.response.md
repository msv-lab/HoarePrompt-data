Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to recursively construct this array by appending elements and reducing the `number` (which represents `X - 1` because the empty subsequence is counted as one).

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and initializes an empty list `result` to store the sequence.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `number` and `sequence` as arguments.
   - It uses a loop to find the appropriate size and overlap for the next segment of the sequence.
   - It appends the necessary elements to the sequence to ensure the number of increasing subsequences is correct.
   - It recursively calls itself with the reduced `number`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the recursive calls, the program prints the length of the `result` list and the elements of the list.

4. **Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `number` is 0.
   - The loop and the conditions within `func_1` ensure that the sequence is constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.
   - The use of bitwise operations and the loop to find the appropriate size and overlap is a valid approach to construct the sequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle large values of `X` (up to \(10^{18}\)) efficiently.
   - The sequence length is constrained to be at most 200, which is a reasonable limit given the problem constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of using powers of 2 and bitwise operations to construct the sequence is mathematically sound and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - The recursive nature of `func_1` ensures that the sequence is built correctly and efficiently.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
