Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X = 1`. According to the problem description, `X` should be in the range `[2, 10^18]`, but if we consider a slightly broader context, the program should ideally handle `X = 1` by returning an array with exactly one element, which has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence). However, the function `func_1` is designed to generate sequences based on the assumption that `number >= 0`, and it does not handle the case where `number = 0` correctly. Specifically, the function returns `(0, 0)` when `number = 0`, which does not contribute to the sequence, and the program does not print the correct output for `X = 1`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 8`, the program should generate an array with exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but the current logic in `func_1` may not produce the correct sequence for such inputs.

To further illustrate, let's consider the input `X = 8`:
- The program should generate an array with exactly 8 increasing subsequences.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` might not produce the correct sequence, leading to an incorrect number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least these cases.
