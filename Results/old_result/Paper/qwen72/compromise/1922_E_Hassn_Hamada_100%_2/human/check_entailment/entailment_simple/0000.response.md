Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of generating an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to recursively construct an array that meets the criteria by finding the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences needed and then appending a sequence of numbers that will create the required number of new subsequences.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Return Value in Base Case**: The function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` when `number` is `0`. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the function is supposed to modify the `sequence` in place and does not need to return values. The return statement can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `size_overlap`**: The loop and the logic inside `func_1` are intended to find the largest size `s` such that `(1 << s) - (1 << i) <= number`. However, the loop starts with `i` ranging from the maximum value in `sequence` to `-1`, which is incorrect. The loop should start from a reasonable value that ensures the sequence can be constructed correctly. Additionally, the tuple `size_overlap` is initialized to `(0, 0)`, which might not be the correct initial value.

3. **Incorrect Append Logic**: The program appends `i + overlap` to the sequence, but this logic is flawed. The sequence should be constructed in such a way that it ensures the increasing subsequences are counted correctly. The current logic does not guarantee that the sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The recursive call to `func_1` is made with `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, which is intended to subtract the number of subsequences created by the current addition from the total required. However, the logic for calculating the new `number` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to find a sequence that satisfies the condition (i.e., when `X` is such that no valid sequence can be constructed). The problem statement requires printing `-1` in such cases, but the program does not check for this condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
