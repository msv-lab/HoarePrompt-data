To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(size - overlap):`.
   - The loop will execute if the range is non-empty, i.e., `size - overlap` must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200.
   - `size` is the largest size such that (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number.
   - `overlap` is the corresponding index from the sequence.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0.
   - This means `size` must be greater than `overlap`.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `size` is greater than `overlap` for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200, `size` is the largest size such that (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number, `overlap` is the corresponding index from the sequence, `size` must be greater than `overlap`, `i` is 0**
