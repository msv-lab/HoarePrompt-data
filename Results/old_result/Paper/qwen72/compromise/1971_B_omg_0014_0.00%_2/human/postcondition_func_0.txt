The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of `s` (if `s` is not already in lexicographical order) or the lexicographically largest version of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `n` (unchanged), `s` (holding the last input string read), and `a`, `b`, and `c` (updated based on the last string processed).
