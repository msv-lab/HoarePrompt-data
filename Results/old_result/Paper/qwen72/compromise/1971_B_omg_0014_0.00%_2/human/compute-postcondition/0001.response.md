To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range(n)` loop. The other information provided about the function `func`, the string `s`, and the integer `t` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
