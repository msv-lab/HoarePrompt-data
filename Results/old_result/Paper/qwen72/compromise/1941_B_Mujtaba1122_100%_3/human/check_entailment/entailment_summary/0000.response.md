Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. 

The provided functions are:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.

Let's analyze `func_2` in detail:
- It iterates over the indices from 1 to \( n-2 \).
- For each index \( i \), it checks if the element at \( i \) is greater than 1 and the elements at \( i-1 \) and \( i+1 \) are greater than 0.
- If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing the elements at \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
- If at any point the element at \( i-1 \) is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, there are a few issues with `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The operation is applied in a way that does not correctly decrement the elements. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
   list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   ```
   should be:
   ```python
   list[i + 1] -= 1
   list[i] -= 2
   list[i - 1] -= 1
   ```
   This is because the operation should decrement each element by a fixed amount, not by the value of the previous element.

2. **Early Termination**: The function prints 'no' and returns if the element at \( i-1 \) is not zero after the operation. This is incorrect because the operation might still be applicable to other indices, and the function should continue to check the entire list.

3. **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should ensure that all elements are zero, not just the first \( n \) elements (which is redundant since the list has \( n \) elements).

Given these issues, the provided `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The operation is applied incorrectly, and the function may terminate prematurely without checking all possible indices.

Correctness: **False**
