Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `list[0]` is 0.
   - `list[1]` is 0.
   - For all `j` in the range `2` to `n-2`, `list[j]` is 0.
   - The value of `list[n-1]` is the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of all the values that were originally in `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` multiplied by 1.
   - `list[n-2]` is 0.
   - The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

2. **Understanding the List:**
   - The list `list` is mostly filled with zeros, except for the last element `list[n-1]`.
   - The value of `list[n-1]` is modified to be the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of all the values from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]`.
   - Since all elements from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` are 0, the sum of these elements is 0.
   - Therefore, `list[n-1]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from it does not change its value.

3. **Function `func_1(list, n)`:**
   - The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print('NO')` is executed.
   - The string `'NO'` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Given this analysis, the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
