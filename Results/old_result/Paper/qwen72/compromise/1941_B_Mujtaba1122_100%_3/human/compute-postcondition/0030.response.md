The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` reduces the value of `list[i - 1]` by itself, effectively setting `list[i - 1]` to 0. Given that `i` is 4, `list[i - 1]` corresponds to `list[3]`.

Initial State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
- `i` is 4.
- `list[0]` is 0.
- `list[1]` is 0.
- `list[2]` is 0.
- `list[3]` must be greater than 0.
- `list[4]` must be greater than 1.
- `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`.
- `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`.

After executing the code:
- `list[3]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is greater than 1 and is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`.**
