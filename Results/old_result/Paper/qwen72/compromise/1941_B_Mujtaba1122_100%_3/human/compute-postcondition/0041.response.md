To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `list[i]`
- `list[i - 1]`
- `list[i + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 4
- `list[0]` is 0
- `list[1]` is 0
- `list[2]` is 0
- `list[3]` is greater than 0
- `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3] - list[3]` (which is still greater than 0)
- `list[5]` is greater than 0

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `list[i] > 1`:
   - Since `i` is 4, we need `list[4] > 1`.
   - The current state of `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3] - list[3]`, which is still greater than 0. However, we need to ensure it is greater than 1. Therefore, `list[4]` must be greater than 1 after the adjustment.

2. `list[i - 1] > 0`:
   - Since `i` is 4, we need `list[3] > 0`.
   - The current state of `list[3]` is greater than 0, which satisfies this condition.

3. `list[i + 1] > 0`:
   - Since `i` is 4, we need `list[5] > 0`.
   - The current state of `list[5]` is greater than 0, which satisfies this condition.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `list[4]` to be greater than 1. The other conditions are already satisfied.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` is greater than 1, `list[5]` is greater than 0**
