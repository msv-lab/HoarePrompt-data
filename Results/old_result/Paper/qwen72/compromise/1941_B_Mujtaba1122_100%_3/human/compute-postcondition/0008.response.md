Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 1, `list[0]` is `list[0] - list[0]`, `list[1]` is `list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 2 * list[0]`, `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[0]`**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` reduces the value of `list[0]` by itself, making `list[0]` equal to 0. The values of `list[1]` and `list[2]` remain as they were previously defined. The value of `i` is still 1, and the length of the list `n` remains unchanged.
