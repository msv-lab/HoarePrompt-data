Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is 0, and `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The list `list` remains a list of non-negative integers of the same length `n` (where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
- The index `i` is still 3, as it was not modified within the loop.
- The first three elements of the list (`list[0]`, `list[1]`, and `list[2]`) remain 0, as they were not affected by the loop.
- The fourth element of the list (`list[3]`) is now 0, as it was decremented by `2 * list[2]` in the first iteration and then further decremented by `2 * list[3]` in subsequent iterations until it reached 0.
- The fifth element of the list (`list[4]`) is also 0, as it was decremented by `list[2]` in the first iteration and then further decremented by `2 * list[3]` in subsequent iterations until it reached 0.
- The sixth element of the list (`list[5]`) is now `list[5] - list[3]`, reflecting the final decrement that occurred when `list[4]` was greater than 1 and `list[5]` was greater than 0.

The loop terminates when `list[4]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[5]` is no longer greater than 0. By the end, both `list[3]` and `list[4]` are 0, and `list[5]` is reduced by the value of `list[3]`.
