Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 2, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is `list[1]`, `list[2]` must be greater than 1, `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i + 1` (which is `3` since `i` is `2`) by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[1]` since `i` is `2`).
- The value of `list[3]` is updated to `list[3] - list[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
