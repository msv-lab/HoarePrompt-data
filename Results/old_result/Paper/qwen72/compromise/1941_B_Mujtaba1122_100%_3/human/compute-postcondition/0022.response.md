Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- `i` is 3, so `i - 1` is 2.
- `list[2]` is greater than 0, and the code subtracts `1 * list[2]` from `list[2]`, which results in `list[2]` becoming 0.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
