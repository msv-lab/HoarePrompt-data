Output State: **`palka` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `i` is in `pl`, `d` contains the key `i` with its value set to 1.** 

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. The conditions about `i` being the third element in `palka` and whether `i` is in `pl` remain unchanged. However, since `d[i]` is explicitly set to 1, the value of `d[i]` is now 1 regardless of its previous state. The condition that `i` is in `pl` is also maintained, as the code does not modify `pl`.
