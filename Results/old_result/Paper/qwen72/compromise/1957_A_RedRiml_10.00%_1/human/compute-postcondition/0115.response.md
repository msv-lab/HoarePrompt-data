Postcondition: ***`palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `pl`, `shapes` is 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, and `ln` is an input integer.***
