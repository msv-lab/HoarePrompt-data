To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`palka`**: This is a list of integers input by the user.
2. **`d`**: This is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
3. **`pl`**: This is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
4. **`shapes`**: This is the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.
5. **`t`**: Remains unchanged.
6. **`n`**: Remains unchanged.
7. **`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`**: Remain unchanged.
8. **`w`**: Must be greater than the new value of `_`.
9. **`_`**: Is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`.
10. **`ln`**: Is an input integer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`palka`**: This list contains integers input by the user. For example, `palka = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
2. **`d`**: This dictionary will count the occurrences of each integer in `palka`. For the example above, `d` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.
3. **`pl`**: This list contains unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. For the example above, `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4. **`shapes`**: This is the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times. From the example above, the integers 3 and 4 appear 3 or more times, so `shapes` would be `2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times)**

For the example provided (`palka = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`), the output would be:

Output: **2**
