Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `k`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of the list `a` and is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is equal to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0 and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.***
