Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the third and the second element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `2 * dif` if `k >= dif * 2` or remains equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` otherwise, `res` is equal to `n - 3` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2` otherwise.**
