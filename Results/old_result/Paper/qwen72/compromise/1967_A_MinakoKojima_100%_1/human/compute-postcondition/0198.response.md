Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` as its last element, and the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations or has broken out of the loop due to `k` becoming 0. Additionally, the current value of `k` is not 0.**
