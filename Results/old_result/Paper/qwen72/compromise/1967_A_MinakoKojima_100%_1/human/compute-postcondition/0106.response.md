Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`, `k` is 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1` if `dif` is not 0, or `n - 3` if `dif` is 0, and `res` is incremented by `k % (i + 1)`, which is 0 because `k` is 0. If `i` is 0, the program state remains unchanged.***
