Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, and `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `ans_list`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least two elements, `a` is the second element in `ans_list`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `ans_list`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
