Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` or remains equal to the first element of the list `a` otherwise, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of the list `a`, and `res` is equal to `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `dif` is not 0, or remains equal to `n - 1` otherwise. If `dif` is 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `dif` is the difference between the third and the second element of the list `a`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains equal to the first element of the list `a` and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `k >= dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `2 * dif` and `res` is equal to `n - 4`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` but `k < dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` and `res` is equal to `n - 3`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 2` and `res` is either `n - 3 + k % 2` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `dif` is the difference between the fourth and the third element of the list `a`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains equal to the first element of the list `a` and `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `k >= dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `2 * dif` and `res` is `n - 5`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)` but `k < dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` and `res` is `n - 4`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 2` and `res` is `n - 3 + k % 2` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` otherwise. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3` and `res` is updated to `res + k % 3`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
