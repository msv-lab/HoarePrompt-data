Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` as its last element, and the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations or has broken out of the loop due to `k` becoming 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to its current value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
