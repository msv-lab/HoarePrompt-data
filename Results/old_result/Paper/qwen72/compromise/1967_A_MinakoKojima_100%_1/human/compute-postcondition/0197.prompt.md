Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is now equal to `n - 1`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, and the loop will execute one more time if the input value is greater than the number of iterations completed so far.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `ans` is set to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, and `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is updated to `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a` plus either the difference between the second and third elements of `a` (if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times 2) or `k` divided by 2 (if `k` is less than `dif` times 2), `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, and `dif` is the difference between the second and third elements of `a`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 2, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a` plus either the difference between the second and third elements of `a` (if `k` was greater than or equal to `dif` times 2 before the code execution) or `k` divided by 2 (if `k` was less than `dif` times 2 before the code execution). If `dif` is not 0, `ans` is further updated to be `ans` plus either `dif` (if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` times 3) or `k` divided by 3 (if `k` is less than `dif` times 3). `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `a`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 0 after the update, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
