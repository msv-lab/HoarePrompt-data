Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a` and is not 0, `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to the first element of the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and `res` remains `n - 1`.**
