Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases, and all elements in `ans_list` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains within the specified range, `n` and `k` retain their initial values for the last test case, `a` is still a sorted list of positive integers for the last test case, `ans` and `res` are the final updated values after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, and `ans_list` contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases. Additionally, all elements in `ans_list` have been printed to the console.
