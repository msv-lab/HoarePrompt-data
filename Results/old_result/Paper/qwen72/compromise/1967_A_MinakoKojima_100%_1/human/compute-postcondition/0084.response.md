Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - dif`, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` plus the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a` (`dif`), `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of the first element of the list `a` as its last element, `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is now `n - 2`.** 

The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
