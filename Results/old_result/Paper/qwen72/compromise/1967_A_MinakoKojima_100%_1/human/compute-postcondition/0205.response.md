Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 for the last test case, `k` is the input integer greater than or equal to 0 for the last test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0 for the last test case, `ans` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop for the last test case, and `ans_list` is a list that contains the final updated value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all the iterations for all `t` test cases:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, representing the number of test cases.
- The variable `n` holds the value of the number of distinct types of cards for the last test case.
- The variable `k` holds the value of the number of coins for the last test case, which could be 0 or greater than 0.
- The variable `a` is a sorted list of integers representing the number of cards of each type for the last test case.
- The variable `ans` is the final computed value for the last test case, which is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and the remaining coins `k`.
- The variable `res` is the final computed value for the last test case, which is updated based on the number of times `res` was decremented during the loop and the remainder of `k` divided by `n` if `k` is not 0.
- The variable `ans_list` is a list that contains the final value of `ans` for each of the `t` test cases, in the order they were processed.
