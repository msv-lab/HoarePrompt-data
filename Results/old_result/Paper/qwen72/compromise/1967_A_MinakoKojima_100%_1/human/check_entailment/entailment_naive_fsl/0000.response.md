Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Actual Output:**
The program outputs a different value.

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Initially, you have 1 card of type 1, 2 cards of type 2, and 3 cards of type 3.
- You can buy up to 5 new cards.
- To maximize the score, you can buy 2 more cards of type 1 and 2 more cards of type 2, making the total number of cards for each type: 3 cards of type 1, 4 cards of type 2, and 3 cards of type 3.
- After rearranging, one possible optimal arrangement is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.
- This arrangement contains 10 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

The program's logic for distributing the coins and calculating the final score does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect output.
