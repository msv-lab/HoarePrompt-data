Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Problem Requirement**:
   - The problem requires determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping the array any number of times.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient to meet the problem's requirement.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix.
   - This can be done by finding the first and last positions where the array is not sorted and checking if the subarray between these positions can be sorted by a single swap.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of making the array non-decreasing through the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
