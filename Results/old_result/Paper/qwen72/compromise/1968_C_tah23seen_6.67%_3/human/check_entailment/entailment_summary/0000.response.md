### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`:**
   - The first element of the `ans` array is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation `arr[0] % ans[0]` to yield `arr[0]`.

2. **Calculation of `ans[i]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-2`:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. This ensures that `ans[i]` is greater than `arr[i-1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation `arr[i] % ans[i-1]` to yield `arr[i]`.
   - If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is incremented by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` until `ans[i]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. This is done to ensure that `ans[i]` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition.

3. **Calculation of `ans[n-1]`:**
   - The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`. This ensures that `ans[n-1]` is greater than `arr[n-1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation `arr[n-1] % ans[n-2]` to yield `arr[n-1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the `ans` array for each test case, which should satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly generates an array `ans` that satisfies the conditions for each test case. The logic ensures that each `ans[i]` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected and handles all edge cases appropriately.
