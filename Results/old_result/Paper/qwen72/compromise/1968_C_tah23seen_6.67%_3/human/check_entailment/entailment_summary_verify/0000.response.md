### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func_1` and the program to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`: This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2` and is a valid starting point.
2. **Loop for constructing `a_i` values**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`:
     - `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`: This sets `a_{i+1}` to be `x_{i+1} + a_i`.
     - If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1}` is always greater than `a_i` and that the modulo condition `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` is satisfied.
3. **Setting the last element**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`: This sets `a_n` to be `a_{n-1} + x_n`, ensuring that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

#### Program:
1. **Reading input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `arr`.
2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - The program calls `func_1` with `arr` and `n` to get the list `ans`.
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle cases where the constructed `a_i` values do not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, let's verify this with the provided function summary and the logic of `func_1`.

1. **Correctness of `ans[0]`**:
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2`, which is a valid starting point.

2. **Correctness of the loop**:
   - The loop ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `ans[i]` and that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]` by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until the condition is satisfied. This logic is correct and ensures that the modulo condition is met for all `i` from 1 to `n-2`.

3. **Correctness of the last element**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`, which is correct.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `3 1 2`
   - Output: `2 3 5`
   - Verification:
     - `a_2 % a_1 = 3 % 2 = 1` (correct for `x_2`).
     - `a_3 % a_2 = 5 % 3 = 2` (correct for `x_3`).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `3 2 1`
   - Output: `3 5 6`
   - Verification:
     - `a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2` (correct for `x_2`).
     - `a_3 % a_2 = 6 % 5 = 1` (correct for `x_3`).

Both examples satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The function `func_1` and the program correctly handle the construction of the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the modulo condition is met for all elements, and the examples provided in the original assessment do not demonstrate a failure of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
