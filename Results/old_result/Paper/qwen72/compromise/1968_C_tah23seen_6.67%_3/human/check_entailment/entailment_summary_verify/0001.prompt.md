You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is calculated as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`, and if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is incremented by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

4. **Middle Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it keeps adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the First Element:**
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

- **Correctness of Middle Elements:**
  - `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.
  - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]: ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` ensures that `a_{i+1}` is always greater than `x_{i+1}` and the condition `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}` is maintained.

- **Correctness of the Last Element:**
  - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Test Case:**
  - The program handles a single test case correctly.

- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by decrementing `t` after each test case.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program handles the boundary conditions for `n` (2 to 500) and the values of `x_i` (1 to 500) as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
