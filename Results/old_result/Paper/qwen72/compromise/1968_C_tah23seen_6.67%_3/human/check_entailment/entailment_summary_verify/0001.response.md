### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

4. **Middle Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it keeps adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`. This condition should always be true because `arr[i]` and `ans[i]` are both positive integers, and `arr[i + 1]` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `ans[i + 1]` should always be greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` after the initial assignment `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the First Element:**
  - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `a_1` is just one more than `x_2`.

- **Correctness of Middle Elements:**
  - The assignment `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` is correct and ensures that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_{i+1}`.
  - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]: ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` is unnecessary because `ans[i + 1]` will always be greater than `arr[i + 1]` after the initial assignment. This is because `ans[i]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i]` (as it is built up from previous elements), and `arr[i]` is a positive integer.

- **Correctness of the Last Element:**
  - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Test Case:**
  - The program handles a single test case correctly.

- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by decrementing `t` after each test case.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program handles the boundary conditions for `n` (2 to 500) and the values of `x_i` (1 to 500) as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. However, the while loop in the middle elements is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code without affecting its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct, but it can be optimized by removing the unnecessary while loop.
