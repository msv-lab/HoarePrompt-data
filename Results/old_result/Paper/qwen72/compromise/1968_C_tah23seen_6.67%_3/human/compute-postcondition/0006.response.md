Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `ans[1]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `arr[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[1]` is updated by adding the value of `ans[0]` to it.
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + (arr[0] + 1)`, which simplifies to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + arr[0] + 1` or `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
- Since the initial value of `ans[1]` was `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1` and it is now `3 * arr[0] + 2`, the value of `ans[1]` has increased.
- The condition that `ans[1]` was initially less than `arr[1]` is now no longer valid, so the new state is that `ans[1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[1]`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
