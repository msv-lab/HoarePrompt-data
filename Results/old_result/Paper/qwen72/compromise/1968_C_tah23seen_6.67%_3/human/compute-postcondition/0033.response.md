Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. `i` is `n-2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state of the list `ans` is such that `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, and all other elements are initialized to 0.
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-3` (i.e., `n-2` times).
- For each iteration:
  - `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
  - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, a nested while loop runs, repeatedly adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
- After all iterations, `ans[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` will be equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`.
- The loop variable `i` will have the value `n-2` after the loop completes.
