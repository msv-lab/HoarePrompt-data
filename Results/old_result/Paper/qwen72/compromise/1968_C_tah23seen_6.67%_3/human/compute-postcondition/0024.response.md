Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]` or `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1` otherwise, `ans[2]` is set to `arr[1] + ans[1] * m` if `ans[2]` was originally less than `arr[2]` and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + (m-1) * 2 * arr[0] + (m-1)`, otherwise `ans[2]` remains equal to `arr[1] + ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 4.**
