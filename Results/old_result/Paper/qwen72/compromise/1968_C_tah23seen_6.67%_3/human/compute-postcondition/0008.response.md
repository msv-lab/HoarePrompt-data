Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] + ans[0]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[1]` must be greater than the current value of `ans[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[1]` by adding `ans[0]` to it.
- Initially, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- Initially, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`.
- After the update, `ans[1]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] + ans[0]`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than `ans[1]` still holds, but `ans[1]` is now a larger value.
