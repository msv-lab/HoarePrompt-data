The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the condition must still hold true after the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `ans[i + 1]` was increased by `ans[i]`. Therefore, for the loop to proceed, `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `ans[i + 1]`.

Given that the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `arr[3]`, and it must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`, we need to ensure that `arr[3]` is adjusted to meet this condition.

State: **The value of `ans[i + 1]` is increased by `ans[i]`. `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`.**
