#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop. If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `i` is -1, `j` is -1.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which is the maximum number of pairs of cards that can be matched based on the rules provided in the loop, considering the initial state of `cards` and the dynamic programming table `dp` that is updated according to the count of each card value in `cards`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `cards` from user input. It then computes and returns the maximum number of pairs of cards that can be matched based on the rules provided, considering the initial state of the cards. The function uses a dynamic programming table `dp` to store intermediate results, which is updated according to the count of each card value in `cards`. The final state of the program is that `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of pairs that can be matched, and this value is returned.
