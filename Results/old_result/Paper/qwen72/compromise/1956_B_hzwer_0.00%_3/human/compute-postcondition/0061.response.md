Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, and the integer `j + 1` appears at least once in the list `cards`. Additionally, the integer `j + 1` appears more than once in the list `cards`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by assigning it the maximum of three expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- The values of `i` and `j` are `n - 5` and `n - 1` respectively, and these values remain unchanged.
- The 2D list `dp` is updated at the position `[i][j]` with the calculated maximum value.
- All other initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.
