Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- Given `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 2`, the specific indices being updated are `dp[n - 3][n - 2]`.
- The values of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` are used to determine the new value of `dp[n - 3][n - 2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
