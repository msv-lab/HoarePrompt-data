Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` updates the value of `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` to be the same as `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `cards`, and the other elements of `dp` remain unchanged. The specific values of `i` and `j` are also unchanged, remaining as `n - 3` and `n - 2` respectively.
