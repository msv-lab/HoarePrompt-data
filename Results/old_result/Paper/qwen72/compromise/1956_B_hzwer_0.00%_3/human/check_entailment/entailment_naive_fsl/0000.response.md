Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach but does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy of both players. 

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
The program may produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly account for the optimal play of both players. The logic in the `dp` table initialization and the conditions within the loops do not reflect the correct strategy for maximizing your score while minimizing Nene's score.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should consider the optimal moves for both players and ensure that the dynamic programming table is updated based on the best possible moves at each step. The current implementation does not do this correctly.
