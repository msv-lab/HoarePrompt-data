You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a number of test cases `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list, one by one. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution, `func_1`, determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal play strategy described in the problem. The game involves players making decisions to swap wallets and remove coins, and the outcome depends on the number of coins each player has and the sequence of moves they make.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 1`:
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 1` and `b = 3`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 3`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is empty.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
  - Bob wins.

However, according to `func_1`, the sum of `a` and `b` is 4, which is even, so it would return "Bob". This is correct in this case, but let's consider another case:

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the case where `a = 4` and `b = 5`:
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 5` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice. After swapping, `a = 4` and `b = 4`.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 3`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 3` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 2` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice. After swapping, `a = 4` and `b = 2`.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 4` and `b = 1`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob. After swapping, `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
  - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 4`.
- **Bob's turn:**
  - Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is empty.
  - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet. Now, `a = 0` and `b = 3`.
- **Alice's turn:**
  - Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
  - Bob wins.

However, according to `func_1`, the sum of `a` and `b` is 9, which is odd, so it would return "Alice". This is incorrect because Bob can force a win by playing optimally.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases, and it is incorrect.
