### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. The player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
     2. The player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet, provided the wallet is not empty.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is a turn-based game where the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
     - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This function is correct because it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the values of `a` and `b` to determine the winner for each test case.
     - It stores the results in a list and prints them one by one.
     - This function is also correct as it correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1, as shown in the example.
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)), as specified in the problem description.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases, as specified by the input format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. The reasoning and implementation align with the problem's requirements and the function summaries.

### Correctness:
**True**
