Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins in both wallets combined. This is because each player must remove one coin on their turn, and the game continues until one player cannot make a move.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Function Logic**: `func_1(a, b)` returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.
- **Correctness**: This logic is based on the observation that the game will always end when the total number of coins is 1 (since the last player to remove a coin will leave the opponent with an empty wallet). If the total number of coins is even, the game will end with Bob's turn (since Alice starts and they alternate turns). If the total number of coins is odd, the game will end with Alice's turn.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Function Logic**: `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`, calling `func_1(a, b)`, and storing the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Combined Correctness:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.
- **Output Handling**: `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.
- **Game Logic**: `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
