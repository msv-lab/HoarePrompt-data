Output State: **The `nodes` defaultdict is populated with the adjacency lists for each node in the graph, where each node `u` has a list of nodes `v` that are directly connected to it. The `edges` list remains empty. The `empty` variable remains True. The `start` variable remains unchanged. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, and `t` remains 1.**
