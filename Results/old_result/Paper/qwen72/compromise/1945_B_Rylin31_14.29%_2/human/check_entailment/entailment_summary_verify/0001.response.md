### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates over each test case, reading the values \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \) for each case. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**:
   - The program calculates \( \text{mn} = \min(a, b) + m \). This step is intended to determine the maximum number of minutes within which we need to consider the visibility of fireworks.
   - The program then checks if \( m \) is divisible by both \( a \) and \( b \) and if neither \( a \) nor \( b \) is 1. If this condition is met, it adds 1 to the result. This logic is flawed because the condition \( m \% a == 0 \) and \( m \% b == 0 \) does not correctly determine the overlap of fireworks. Instead, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a \) and \( b \) to determine the overlap correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where \( a \) or \( b \) is 1 correctly. If either \( a \) or \( b \) is 1, the visibility period will be continuous, and the number of fireworks visible at any given time will be \( m + 1 \). However, the program does not account for this in the correct way.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, due to the logical error in the overlap handling, the results are incorrect.

### Corrected Logic:

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a \) and \( b \). The LCM will help us identify the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The corrected logic should be:

- Calculate the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \).
- Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the period \( \text{mn} \).
- Subtract the number of overlapping fireworks (which is \( \text{mn} // \text{LCM} \)) to avoid double-counting.
- Add 1 to account for the initial overlap if \( \text{mn} \) is greater than or equal to the LCM.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        l = lcm(a, b)
        if mn >= l:
            print(mn // a + mn // b - mn // l + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **LCM Calculation**: The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of \( a \) and \( b \).
- **Overlap Handling**: If \( \text{mn} \) is greater than or equal to the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \), it means there is an overlap. The number of overlapping fireworks is \( \text{mn} // l \). We subtract this from the sum of fireworks visible from each installation and add 1 to account for the initial overlap.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling overlaps. The corrected program correctly handles the overlap by using the LCM and provides the correct output for the given problem.

Final: **False**
