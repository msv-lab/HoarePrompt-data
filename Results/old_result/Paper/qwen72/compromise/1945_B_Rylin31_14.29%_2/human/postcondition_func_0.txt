The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. It calculates the value `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case are the same as their initial values.
