Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is incremented by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.
- The value of `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, and `inc` is -1, so `start + inc` is `len(lst) - 3`.
- The value of `mini` is updated only if `start - 1 > -1`, which means `len(lst) - 3 > -1` or `len(lst) > 2`. If this condition is true, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. If the condition is false, `mini` remains unchanged.
