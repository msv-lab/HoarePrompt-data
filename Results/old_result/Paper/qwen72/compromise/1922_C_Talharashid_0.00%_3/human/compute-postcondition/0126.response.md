Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the first integer from the last user input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the last user input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is an input integer. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` ≥ `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `m` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The loop counter `i` is now `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` remain as defaultdicts with a default value of 0.
- The variables `n` and `lst` remain unchanged, with `n` being an input integer and `lst` being the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `start` is the first integer from the last user input, decremented by 1.
- The variable `end` is the second integer from the last user input, decremented by 1.
- The variable `inc` remains -1.
- The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so it is 0 after the loop.
- The variable `m` is the input integer that determined the number of iterations.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the final values of `start` and `end` in the same way as described in the loop body. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.
