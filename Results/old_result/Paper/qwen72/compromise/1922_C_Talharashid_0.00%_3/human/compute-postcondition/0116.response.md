The code snippet `start, end = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. The initial state specifies that `start` and `end` are already defined, but this code will overwrite their values with the new input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the first integer from the new user input, `end` is the second integer from the new user input, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` ≥ `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
