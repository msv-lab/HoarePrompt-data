Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers in ascending order, then reads an integer `m` and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)`. It calculates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, which store the accumulated distances between consecutive elements in the list `lst` when traversed from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each query `(x_i, y_i)`, it computes the minimum distance between the two cities using the accumulated distances in `d1` and `d2`, and prints this minimum distance. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function concludes. **
