Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `d1` contains the cumulative sum of `s` at each step of the loop, `inc` is -1.**

The code snippet `s = 0` resets the variable `s` to 0. The initial state specifies that `s` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` from index 0 to `end - 1`, but after this line, `s` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
