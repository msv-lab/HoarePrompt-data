The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end - 1] - d2[start - 1])`, and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
