Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111000 if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111000. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `start` is updated to 1. If `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**
