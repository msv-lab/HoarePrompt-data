Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc` from the previous iteration, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1[start]` is now `s`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is `s + 1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**

The code snippet `mini = 11111111` sets the value of `mini` to 11111111, overriding any previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
