Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` calculates the absolute difference between the values at indices `end` and `start` in the list `d1` and assigns this value to `s1`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `start` is less than `end`, so the indices are valid for the list `d1`.
- The value of `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.
