Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `s` to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
