Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `len(lst) - 1` to the variable `end`. The length of `lst` is the number of elements in the list, so `end` is the index of the last element in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
