Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and the original value of `mini` (which was 11111111). Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.***
