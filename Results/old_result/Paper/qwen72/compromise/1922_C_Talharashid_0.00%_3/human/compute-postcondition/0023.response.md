Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
