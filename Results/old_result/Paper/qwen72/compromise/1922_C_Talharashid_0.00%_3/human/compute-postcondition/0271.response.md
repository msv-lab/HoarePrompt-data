Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 1, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 1111100. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
