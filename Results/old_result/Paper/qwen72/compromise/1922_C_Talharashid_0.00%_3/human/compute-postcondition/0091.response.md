The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, which is correct for the loop to begin. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the cumulative sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the end to the beginning, `m` must be greater than 0**
