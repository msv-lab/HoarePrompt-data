Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 5`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` and `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 5])`, `s` is the minimum value between 11111111 and `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` incremented by 1 or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 5])` depending on the value of `mini`, `d2[len(lst) - 4]` is `s`, and `d2[start]` is now `s`.**
