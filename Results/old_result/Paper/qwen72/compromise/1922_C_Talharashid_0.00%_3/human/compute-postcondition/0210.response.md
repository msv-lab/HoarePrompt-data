Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `d2[start]` is `s` + 1, `mini` remains unchanged, `s` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is incremented by 1.
- Since `d2[start]` was initially equal to `s`, after `s` is incremented, `d2[start]` is now equal to `s + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
