Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `s` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` from index 0 to `end - 1`, and `d1` contains the cumulative sum of `s` at each step of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The value of `end` is updated to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `s`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `s` is still the sum of the minimum absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` from index 0 to `end - 1`, but since `end` is now 0, this sum is 0.
- The specific values of `d1` are still the cumulative sums of `s` at each step of the loop, but since `end` is now 0, no new values are added to `d1`.
