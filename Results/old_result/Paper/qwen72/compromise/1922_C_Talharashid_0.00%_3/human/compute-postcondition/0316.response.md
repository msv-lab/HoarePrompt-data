Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`, and `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and the absolute difference between the last element of `lst` and the second-to-last element of `lst`.***
