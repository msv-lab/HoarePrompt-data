Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start` must be greater than 0, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `inc` is -1. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum value between `11111111` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111`. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**
