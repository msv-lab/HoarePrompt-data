Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` is the input integer, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is 0. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop counter `i` has reached `m-1`, indicating that the loop has run `m` times.
- The value of `m` remains the same as the input integer provided.
- The variables `start` and `end` are the last input integers provided by the user, each decremented by 1.
- The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, so it will be 0 after the loop completes.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the final values of `start` and `end` in the last iteration, using the accumulated values in `d1` and `d2`.
- The loop will print the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each iteration, but the final values of `s1` and `s2` are based on the last iteration's `start` and `end` values.
