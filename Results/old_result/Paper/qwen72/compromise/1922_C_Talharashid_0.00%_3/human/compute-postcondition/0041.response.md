Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is further incremented by 1, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is further incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`. `d1[start]` is now `s`. If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `s` and `d1[start]` remain unchanged. If `start - 1 <= -1`, `mini` retains its original value, and the rest of the variables and their relationships are as described above.***
