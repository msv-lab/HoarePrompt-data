Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.** 

The value of `s2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. Since `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, if `start` or `end` are not keys in `d1`, their values will default to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
