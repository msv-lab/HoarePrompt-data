Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The initial state remains the same for `t`, `i`, `d1`, and `d2`. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of an input integer.
