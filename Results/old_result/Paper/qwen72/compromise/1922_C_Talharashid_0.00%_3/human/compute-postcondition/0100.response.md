Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.**

The value of `s1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. Since `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, if `end` or `start` are not keys in `d2`, their values will be 0. Therefore, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between these two values, which could be 0 if both `end` and `start` are not in `d2` or if they have the same value in `d2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
