#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries, and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.

    #State: `i` is `t - 1`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default value 0, each containing accumulated distances for each index in the list `lst` for each test case, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the last `end` value from the last test case, `end` is the last `start` value from the last test case, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `start` and `end` are input integers minus 1, `s1` and `s2` are the absolute differences between the accumulated distances in `d1` and `d2` for the query indices, and the minimum of `s1` and `s2` is printed for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers in ascending order, then reads an integer `m` and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)`. It calculates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, which store the accumulated distances between consecutive elements in the list `lst` when traversed from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each query `(x_i, y_i)`, it computes the minimum distance between the two cities using the accumulated distances in `d1` and `d2`, and prints this minimum distance. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function concludes.
