You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `lst`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost to travel from the first city to the last city and vice versa.
   - It uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively.
   - The program iterates from the first city to the last city and from the last city to the first city, updating the dictionaries with the minimum cost at each step.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to a large value (11111111) to ensure it gets updated with the minimum distance.
   - It checks the distance to the next and previous city to find the closest city.
   - If the closest city is the next or previous city, it adds 1 coin to the cumulative cost. Otherwise, it adds the actual distance.
   - This logic is applied in both directions (from start to end and from end to start).

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the start and end cities, adjusts the indices to be 0-based, and calculates the minimum cost using the precomputed dictionaries `d1` and `d2`.
   - It calculates the cost of traveling from the start city to the end city in both directions and prints the minimum of the two.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the start and end cities are the same by ensuring `start` and `end` are different.
   - It also handles the case where the cities are at the boundaries (first or last city) by checking the indices.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently precomputes the costs in both directions, which allows it to handle each query in constant time.
   - The overall complexity is linear with respect to the number of cities and queries, making it suitable for the given constraints.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for finding the closest city and updating the cumulative cost is correct.
   - The query handling correctly uses the precomputed costs to find the minimum cost.

However, there are a few issues in the program:

- **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
  - The program uses `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` to calculate the cost, which is incorrect. The values in `d1` and `d2` are cumulative costs, not distances between cities.
  - The correct approach should be to use the precomputed cumulative costs directly without taking the absolute difference.

- **Incorrect Initialization**:
  - The initial value of `mini` should be `float('inf')` instead of a fixed large number to ensure it is always updated with the correct minimum distance.

- **Redundant Distance Checks**:
  - The program checks the distance to the next and previous city twice in each iteration, which is redundant. It should only check the valid neighbors.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
