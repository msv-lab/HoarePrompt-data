The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by examining the first and last rows and the first and last characters of the grid. If the first row or the first column contains only one unique character and this character is different from the corresponding character in the last row or last column, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` as described in the annotated code.
