Postcondition: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. The first string in `a` either has more than one unique character or is equal to the last string in `a`. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
