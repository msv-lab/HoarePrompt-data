The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `i` is 1, `last_row` is the last character of the input value in `a`**
