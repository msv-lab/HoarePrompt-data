Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing three strings (the two initial input strings and one additional input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, and the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`.
- The initial value of `first_row` is the first character of the string at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string at index 1 in the list `a`.
- After executing the code, `first_row` now includes the first character of the string at index 2 in the list `a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
