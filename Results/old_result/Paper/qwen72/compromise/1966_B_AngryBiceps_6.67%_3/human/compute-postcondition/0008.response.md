Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the string in `a` to `last_row`.
- Initially, `last_row` is an empty string.
- After the execution, `last_row` contains the last character of the string in `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
