Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the second string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Initially, `last_row` was the last character of the string at index 0 in `a`. After execution, `last_row` now includes both the last character of the string at index 0 and the last character of the string at index 1 in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
