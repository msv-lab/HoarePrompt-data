The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `i`, and `last_row`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
3. The string `'NO'` is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
4. Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
