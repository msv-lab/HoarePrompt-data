To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop iterator and will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
