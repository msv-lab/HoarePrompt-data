Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value in `a`, `i` is 0, `last_row` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one input value, `a[-1]` refers to that single input value, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that input value. The other variables remain unchanged.
