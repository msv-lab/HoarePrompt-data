Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has completed, `m` are input integers, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the first string in `a` has only one unique character and is different from the last string in `a`. Otherwise, the first string in `a` either has more than one unique character or is equal to the last string in `a`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the first row is composed of the same character repeated, and this character is different from the character in the last row. Otherwise, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.***
