Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the first string in `a` has only one unique character and is different from the last string in `a`. Otherwise, the first string in `a` either has more than one unique character or is equal to the last string in `a`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the first row is composed of the same character repeated, and this character is different from the character in the last row. Otherwise, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. The input provided to `range` must be greater than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing two strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `m` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing three strings (the original two strings plus the new input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, and then concatenated with the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, and then concatenated with the last character of the string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
