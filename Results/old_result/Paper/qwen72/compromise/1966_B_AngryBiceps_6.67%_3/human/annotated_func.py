#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next n lines contains m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the grid. The function should output "YES" or "NO" for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for the last test case, `first_row` is a string composed of the first character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `last_row` is a string composed of the last character of each of the `n` strings in `a` for the last test case, `i` is `n-1`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions: if the first string in `a` contains only one unique character and is not equal to the last string in `a`, or if the first row is composed of the same character repeated and this character is different from the character in the last row, then "NO" is printed; otherwise, "YES" is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by examining the first and last rows and the first and last characters of the grid. If the first row or the first column contains only one unique character and this character is different from the corresponding character in the last row or last column, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function has printed "YES" or "NO" for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` as described in the annotated code.
