Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is now `n - 1`, where `n` is a positive integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
