Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step. Instead, it appends the elements to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the product in reverse order. This approach does not reflect the correct state of the array after each command is processed. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```
However, the program will produce:
```
24 24 24 8
```
which, when taken modulo 6, results in:
```
0 0 0 2
```
This is incorrect because the product should be recalculated after each command, not just at the end. The correct approach would be to maintain the product of the current state of the array and update it after each command.
