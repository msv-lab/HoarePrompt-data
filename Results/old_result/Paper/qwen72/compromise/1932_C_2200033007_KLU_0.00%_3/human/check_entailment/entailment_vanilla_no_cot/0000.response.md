Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to output the remainder of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step, but it instead appends the elements being removed to a list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order. This approach does not correctly reflect the product of the remaining elements at each step of the command execution.

To fix this, the program should maintain a running product of the elements in the array and update this product by dividing it by the element being removed at each step, while also taking the remainder with `m` at each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], -1, m)) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], -1, m)) % m
            r -= 1
    return b
```

This corrected version maintains the running product and updates it by dividing by the element being removed (using modular inverse to handle the division in modular arithmetic) and then taking the remainder with `m`. This ensures that the product is correctly updated at each step.
