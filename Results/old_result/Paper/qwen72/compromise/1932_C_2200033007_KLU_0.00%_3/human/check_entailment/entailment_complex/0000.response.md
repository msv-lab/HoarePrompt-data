Reasoning:

The program is designed to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and output the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command, modulo `m`. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle this logic.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, it does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command. Instead, it appends the elements directly to `b`.
   - The product calculation is done in the second loop, but it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the same as the product of the remaining elements of `a` after each command.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program does not apply the modulo operation `m` to the product at each step, which is required according to the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would be to maintain the product of the remaining elements of `a` and update it after each command. The product should be taken modulo `m` at each step to ensure it does not overflow and to get the correct remainder.
- The function should output the remainder of the product after each command, not the cumulative product of the elements removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product)
    
    return b
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `product` is initialized to 1.
- **Processing Commands**: For each command in `s`:
  - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element of `a` is multiplied to `product` and the left index `l` is incremented.
  - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element of `a` is multiplied to `product` and the right index `r` is decremented.
  - The product is taken modulo `m` at each step to ensure it remains within the required range.
- **Output**: The list `b` is constructed with the remainders of the product after each command.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. It fails to compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` and apply the modulo operation at each step.

Correctness: **False**
