Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` is supposed to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the beginning of each command execution, and then remove the appropriate element based on the command. However, the function `func_1` constructs a list `b` by simply appending the elements to be removed from `a` based on the commands in `s`, and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This approach does not reflect the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each element is removed.

To correctly implement the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m` before each command.
2. Output this product.
3. Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.

The current implementation fails to calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal, and instead calculates the cumulative product of the removed elements, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
