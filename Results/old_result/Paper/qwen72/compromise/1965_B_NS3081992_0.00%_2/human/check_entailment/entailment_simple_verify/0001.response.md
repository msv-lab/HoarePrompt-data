### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of the sequence sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_7**: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
   - **func_14**: Generates the sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
   - **func_15**: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14` for each test case.

3. **func_14 Analysis**:
   - **Binary Representation**:
     - The function converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
     - `b` is the binary representation of `n`.
     - `bk` is the binary representation of `k`.
     - `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

   - **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
     - If `k == 1`, the function handles it separately:
       - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
       - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of `b`.
       - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other sums up to `n` can be formed.

   - **General Case for `k > 1`**:
     - The function constructs the sequence `ans`:
       - It includes powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-1)`.
       - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence is just below `k`.
       - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
       - It continues with powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`.
       - This ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed except `k`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
     - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and ensuring the sum of the sequence is just below `k` and then adding elements that are too large to form `k` with any combination.
     - For `k == 1`, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2, which ensures no subsequence sums to 1.
     - For `k > 1`, the sequence includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and `k + 1`, which ensures no subsequence sums to `k`.

   - **Subsequences for All `v` in `[1, n]` where `v != k`**:
     - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum up to `2^l - 1` (where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`).
     - By including `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`, it ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed except `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` correctly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25 by carefully selecting elements.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is small (e.g., `n == 2`) correctly.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the functions are called with the correct parameters and that the state of the program is as expected.
   - The sequence generation logic in `func_14` is consistent with the problem requirements and the annotations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It avoids forming a subsequence that sums to `k` while ensuring that all other sums up to `n` can be formed. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the sequence size does not exceed 25.

Final: **True**
