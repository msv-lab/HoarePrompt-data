Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it will call `func_14()` and print its return value followed by a newline. The exact output state cannot be determined without knowing the definitions of `func_10` and `func_14`, but the loop will have printed the return values of `func_14()` for each iteration, each on a new line. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
