Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation as a string, and removes the '0b' prefix.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `bk` is created and holds the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
