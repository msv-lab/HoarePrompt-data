The value `2 * k + 1` is appended to the list `ans`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the values `k - 1 - sum(ans)` (before the new value was added), `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the values `k - 1 - sum(ans)` (before the new value was added), `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`; `n` and `k` remain unchanged; `b` remains the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` remains the length of `b`; `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `lk` remains the length of `bk`.**
