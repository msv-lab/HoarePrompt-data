Functionality: ** The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. During each iteration of the loop, it calls `func_14()` and prints the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character. The function does not modify any variables outside of its scope. After the function concludes, the output will consist of the return values of `func_14()`, each printed on a new line, for a total of `func_10()` iterations. **
