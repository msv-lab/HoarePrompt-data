Output State: **`ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` remains the length of `b`, `bk` remains the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` remains the length of `bk`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- The list `ans` initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2).
- The sum of these powers of 2 is 2^(lk-1) - 1 (since the sum of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(m-1) is 2^m - 1).
- Therefore, the value appended to `ans` is `k - 1 - (2^(lk-1) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2^(lk-1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.
