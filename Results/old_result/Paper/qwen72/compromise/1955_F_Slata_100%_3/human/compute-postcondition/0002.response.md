The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function operates with some predefined or internally generated values for `t` and `p_i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to 4). The constraints for these values are: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each `p_i` is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not described in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates with predefined or internally generated integers `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200 for i from 1 to 4) and returns a result based on these values.**
