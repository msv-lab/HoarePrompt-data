Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Input Splitting**: For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.

3. **Winning Condition Analysis**:
   - The bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence determines the winner.
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (considering their binary representations) is even for each bit position.
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are 001, 010, 011, and 100, respectively. The only bit position that matters for the XOR to be zero is the least significant bit (LSB), which is 1 for 1 and 3, and 0 for 2 and 4.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (1 and 3, or 2 and 4) will not change the parity of the XOR. Therefore, the maximum number of pairs that can be removed is `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`.
   - If there is an odd number of 1s and 3s combined, and an odd number of 2s and 4s combined, removing one 1 and one 3 (or one 2 and one 4) will make the XOR zero. This is captured by the condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the pairs that can be removed and the additional win if the condition for an odd number of 1s and 3s combined and an odd number of 2s and 4s combined is met.

This logic correctly determines the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the constraints and the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
