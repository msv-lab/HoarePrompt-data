Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 where a1[i] and a2[i] represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in a1 and a2 consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to n[i]. The sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a1_list, a2_list):
```

This function will then process each test case based on the provided inputs.
