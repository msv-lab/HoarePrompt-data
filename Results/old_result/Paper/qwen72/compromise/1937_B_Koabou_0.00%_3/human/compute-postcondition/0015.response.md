Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` from the input. It then searches for the first index `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. If such an index is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of `a[0]` up to that index with the suffix of `a[1]` starting from that index. If no such index is found, `s` is set to the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The function also calculates a value `t` which is either `x - i + 1` if an index `i` is found such that `a[0][:i + 1]` matches `s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such index is found. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any values. **
