Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 where a1[i] and a2[i] represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in a1 and a2 consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to n[i]. The sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two binary strings, each of which was read from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the two binary strings. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The variable `a1` remains unchanged. The variable `a2` remains unchanged. The list `s` will either contain the concatenated string formed by slicing `a[0]` up to the index where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', followed by the rest of `a[1]` starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The variable `x` will either be the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or if no such index is found, it will be `n - 1`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the two binary strings. The variable `t` will either be `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index that satisfies `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or if no such index is found, `t` will remain 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The variable `a1` remains unchanged. The variable `a2` remains unchanged. The list `s` will either contain the concatenated string formed by slicing `a[0]` up to the index where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', followed by the rest of `a[1]` starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The variable `x` will either be the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or if no such index is found, it will be `n - 1`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the concatenated string formed by slicing a[0] up to the index where a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', followed by the rest of a[1] starting from that index, or if no such index is found, it will contain the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either `x - i + 1` if an index `i` is found such that `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such index is found)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]` from the input. It then searches for the first index `i` where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. If such an index is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the prefix of `a[0]` up to that index with the suffix of `a[1]` starting from that index. If no such index is found, `s` is set to the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. The function also calculates a value `t` which is either `x - i + 1` if an index `i` is found such that `a[0][:i + 1]` matches `s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such index is found. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any values.
