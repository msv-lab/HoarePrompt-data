Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers.
- `x` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `x - 2`.
- `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, for the first `x - 1` elements.
- If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.
- `num` is calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(count + x - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`i` Calculation:**
   - `i` is defined as `x - 2`.
   - Since `x` is greater than 1, `i` will be a non-negative integer.

2. **`count` Calculation:**
   - `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the first `x - 1` elements of `list0` is exactly 1.
   - This means we are only considering the first `x - 1` elements of `list0` to count the number of consecutive pairs with a difference of 1.

3. **`num` Calculation:**
   - `num` is calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.
   - `list0[0]` is the first element of the sorted list `list0`.
   - `list0[-1]` is the last element of the sorted list `list0`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output `count + x - 2`.

### Final Output:
- `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the first `x - 1` elements of `list0` is exactly 1.
- `x - 2` is the value of `i`.
- The final output is the sum of `count` and `i`.

Since `i` is `x - 2`, the print statement will output:
- `count + (x - 2)`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **count + (x - 2) (where count is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the first x - 1 elements of list0 is exactly 1, and x is the input integer greater than 1)**
