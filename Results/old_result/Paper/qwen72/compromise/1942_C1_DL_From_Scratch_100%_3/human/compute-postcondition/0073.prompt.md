Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, `x` is greater than 1, `i` is `x - 2`, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, for the first `x - 1` elements. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1. `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `x - 2`, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `x - 2`, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1. `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
