### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to form non-intersecting diagonals using these vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
   - The constraint is that `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - In a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn from `x` vertices is `x - 3` (since each triangle requires 3 vertices and each diagonal can form a new triangle).
   - However, the problem also considers the gaps between the chosen vertices. If the gap between two consecutive chosen vertices is 1, it means they are adjacent, and we can form a triangle with the next chosen vertex.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It then reads the list of `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the gap between each pair of consecutive vertices. If the gap is 1, it increments the counter.
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Finally, it prints the result as `count + x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and counts the number of adjacent pairs.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of triangles. This is because:
     - `count` represents the number of triangles formed by adjacent vertices.
     - `x - 3` represents the number of triangles formed by non-adjacent vertices.
     - Adding these together gives `count + (x - 3) + 1 = count + x - 2`.
   - The program handles the case where `x = 2` correctly by outputting 0 (since no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices).
   - The program also handles the case where all vertices are chosen correctly by outputting `x - 2` (since every pair of consecutive vertices can form a triangle with the next vertex).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x = 2` by outputting 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all vertices are chosen by outputting `x - 2`.
   - The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the last and the first vertex.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(x \log x)\) due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \(O(x)\) for storing the list of chosen vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Final: **True**
