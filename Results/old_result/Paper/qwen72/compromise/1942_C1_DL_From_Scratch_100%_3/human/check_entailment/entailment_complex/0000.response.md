Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out, given a regular polygon with `n` sides and a set of `x` chosen vertices. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Signature**: The function signature is incomplete. It should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` to match the problem description, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Logic for Counting Triangles**: The logic for counting triangles is flawed. The function currently counts the number of times the difference between consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1 and adds `x - 2` to this count. This approach does not correctly account for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

   - **Correct Logic**: To maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles, you should consider the segments formed by the chosen vertices. Each segment between two chosen vertices can be divided into triangles by adding diagonals from one of the chosen vertices to the other vertices in the segment. The number of triangles formed in a segment of length `k` (where `k` is the number of vertices in the segment) is `k - 2`.

3. **Handling the Wrap-Around Case**: The function attempts to handle the wrap-around case (where the last chosen vertex and the first chosen vertex form a segment) by calculating `num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. However, this calculation is not correct. The correct way to handle the wrap-around is to calculate the length of the segment from the last chosen vertex to the first chosen vertex, which is `n - (list0[-1] - list0[0])`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is correct. However, the result itself is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
