The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space and the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
