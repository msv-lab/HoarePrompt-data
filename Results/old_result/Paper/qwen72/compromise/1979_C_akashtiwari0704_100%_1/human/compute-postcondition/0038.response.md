To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `T` is 0.
   - `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step.
   - `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`.
   - `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`.
   - `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation.
   - `sumo` is less than `prod`.
   - `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bets` is a positive integer, so `i` will be a non-negative integer (`i = bets - 1`).
   - `a` is a list of integers, and each element `a[j]` is transformed to `prod // a[j]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of the transformed elements in `a`, and it is given that `sumo` is less than `prod`.

3. **Transformation of `a`:**
   - Each element `a[j]` is transformed to `prod // a[j]`.
   - This means that each element in `a` is replaced by the LCM of the original elements in `a` divided by the element itself.

4. **Final Output:**
   - `ans` is a string containing all elements of the transformed list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `a` and `l` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the transformation.

Given the initial state and the transformations, the `print(ans)` statement will print the string containing all elements of the transformed list `a` separated by spaces. Each element in `a` is the result of `prod // a[j]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple of the elements in `a`.

Output: **[a[0] // prod] [a[1] // prod] ... [a[bets-1] // prod] (where each element is the result of the transformation `prod // a[j]` and `prod` is the least common multiple of the elements in `a`)**
