Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- The other variables (`t`, `T`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1 still holds true.
- The value of `T` remains 0.
