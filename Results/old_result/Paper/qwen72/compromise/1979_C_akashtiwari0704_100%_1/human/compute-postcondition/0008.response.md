Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2 is still valid.
