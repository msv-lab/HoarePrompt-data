Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- `bets` remains greater than 0, as it is a condition for the loop to execute.
- `i` is `bets - 1` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from 0 to `bets - 1`.
- Each element `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]` during the loop execution.
- `sumo` is the sum of all the updated `a[i]` values, and it remains less than `prod` as per the initial condition.
- `ans` is a string that contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`, each followed by a space, after the loop has completed all its iterations.
