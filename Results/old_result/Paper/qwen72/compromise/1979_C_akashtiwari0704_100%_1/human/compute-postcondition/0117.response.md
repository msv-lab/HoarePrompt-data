Postcondition: ***`bets` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current state remains as described. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the current state also remains as described.***
