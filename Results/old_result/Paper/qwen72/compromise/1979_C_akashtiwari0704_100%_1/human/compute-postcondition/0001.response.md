To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `T` should be 0, and `t` should be a positive integer. The function `func` and the list `test_cases` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
