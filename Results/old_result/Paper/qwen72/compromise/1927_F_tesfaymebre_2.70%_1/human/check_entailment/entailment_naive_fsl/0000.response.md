Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The issue lies in the logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum edge weight. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the union-find structure and does not properly track the cycle that contains the minimum edge weight.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 3
1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may output a cycle that does not contain the edge with the minimum weight (1), or it may output an incorrect cycle altogether.

The problem is that the program does not correctly handle the union-find operations and cycle detection, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
