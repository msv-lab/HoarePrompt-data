The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is a non-negative integer representing the current vertex in the graph, `parent` is a non-negative integer representing the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.

The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the list `path`, which represents the current path in the DFS traversal.
- Case_2: The function returns an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. It returns the list `path` representing the current path in the DFS traversal if the traversal is successful. If the traversal does not meet the conditions for success, it returns an empty list.**
