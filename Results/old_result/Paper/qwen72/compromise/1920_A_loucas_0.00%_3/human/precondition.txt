t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, with a=1 indicating k >= x, a=2 indicating k <= x, and a=3 indicating k != x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
