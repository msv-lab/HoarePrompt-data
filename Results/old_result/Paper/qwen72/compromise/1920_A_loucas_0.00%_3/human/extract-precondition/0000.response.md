Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines, each containing two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), where a denotes the type of constraint and x is the value associated with the constraint. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
