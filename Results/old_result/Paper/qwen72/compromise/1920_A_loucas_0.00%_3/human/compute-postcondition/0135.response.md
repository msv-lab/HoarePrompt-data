Postcondition: ***`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
