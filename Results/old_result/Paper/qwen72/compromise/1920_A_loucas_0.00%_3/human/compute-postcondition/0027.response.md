Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 2, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists.**

The value of `a` is appended to the list `big`, making `big` a list that now contains the value of `a`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
