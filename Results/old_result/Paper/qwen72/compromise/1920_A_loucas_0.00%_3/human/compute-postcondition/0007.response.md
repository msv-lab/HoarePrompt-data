The only objects in the loop head are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `innerLoop`. If `innerLoop` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `iterable2` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

State: **`loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0**
