Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `less` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 2, `big` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 1, and `no` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was neither 1 nor 2. `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and `iterable` will be `iterable + innerLoop`. The condition `max(big) < min(less)` will still hold true if there are elements in both `big` and `less`. The value of `i` will be the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. `num` remains 0, and `innerLoop` remains the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no` and is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
