Output State: **`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no` and is incremented by 1, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that the program has broken out of the loop or if statement.
