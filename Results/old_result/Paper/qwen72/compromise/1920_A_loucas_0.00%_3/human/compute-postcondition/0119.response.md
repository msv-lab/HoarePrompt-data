The only objects in the loop head are the variables `iterable2` and `innerLoop`. The loop can execute again if `iterable2` is less than `innerLoop`. At the end of the last iteration, `iterable2` is 1, and `innerLoop` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `iterable2` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `innerLoop` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`x` and `a` are input integers. `less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2. `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2. `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list or contains `[a, a]` if `x` is not 1. `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `x` is 1 or 2, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`.**
