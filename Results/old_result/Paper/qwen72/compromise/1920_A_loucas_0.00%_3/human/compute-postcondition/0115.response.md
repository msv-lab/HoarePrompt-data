Output State: **`x` and `a` are input integers, `less` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 2 or an empty list if `x` is not 2, but now `less` contains `a`, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`.**
