To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `big`
   - `less`

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less) - 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `big` must contain at least one element.
   - `less` must contain at least one element.
   - `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`.
   - `i` is `max(big) + 1`.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `min(less)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `max(big) + 1`.
- `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `max(big) + 2`.
- The loop will continue to execute if `i` is still less than `min(less)`.

### Adjusted State:
- `big` must still contain at least one element.
- `less` must still contain at least one element.
- `max(big)` must still be less than `min(less)`.
- `i` is now `max(big) + 2`.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `min(less)`.

### Final State:
State: **`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, and `i` must be less than `min(less)`**.
