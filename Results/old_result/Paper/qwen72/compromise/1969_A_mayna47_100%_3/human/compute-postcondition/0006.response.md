The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `p[i]` satisfies 1 <= p[i] <= n, p[i] != i, and all elements in `p` are distinct. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` of length `n`, where each element `p[i]` is a distinct integer between 1 and n (inclusive) and not equal to `i`. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
