Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 3 otherwise. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party in all scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The program will output:
```
2
3
2
```

This is incorrect for the second test case. The correct output for the second test case should be 2, not 3, because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 2 and 3, and both will come to the party since they are each other's best friends. The program fails to find the optimal solution in this case.
