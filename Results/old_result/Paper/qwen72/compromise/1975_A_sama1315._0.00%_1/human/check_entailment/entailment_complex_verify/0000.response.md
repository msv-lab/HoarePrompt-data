### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. The problem description clearly states that the array can be split into two parts, swapped, and then checked for non-decreasing order. The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this possibility.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - This function does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a non-decreasing order.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results are collected and printed.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the correct answer should be "Yes" because it can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - However, `func_1` will return "No" because the array is not already sorted.

5. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The overall behavior of `func_1` and `func_2` is accurately described.
   - The annotations do not suggest any additional logic that would handle the splitting and swapping of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a non-decreasing order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
