### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts, swapping them, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted. This is a critical oversight because the problem specifically allows for such operations to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it immediately returns "No" without considering any possible splits and swaps.
   - This is incorrect because the problem allows for the array to be split and swapped to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - It correctly handles the input and output format but relies on the incorrect logic of `func_1`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` will return "No" because it is not sorted.
   - However, as the problem description indicates, this array can be sorted by splitting it into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swapping to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`. Further splitting and swapping can result in `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this possibility, leading to an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. To fix this, `func_1` should be modified to check for all possible split points and determine if any of them result in a sorted array after swapping.
