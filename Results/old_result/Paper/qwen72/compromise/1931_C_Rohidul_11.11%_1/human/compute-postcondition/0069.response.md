Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
4. The first `st` elements of `a` are all equal.
5. The last `end` elements of `a` are equal.
6. `l` is `st`.
7. `r` is `l`.
8. `st` must be less than `n - end`.
9. `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list.
10. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is 0.
11. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and both `st` and `end` are 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
12. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, and either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(0, ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `ans` based on the conditions:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is 0.
   - **Case 2:** If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - **Case 3:** Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

2. **Evaluate the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the maximum of 0 and `ans`.
   - Since `ans` can only be 0 or `len(a) - 1` (if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and both `st` and `end` are 0), the `max(0, ans)` will either be 0 or `len(a) - 1`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is 0.
  - `max(0, 0)` is 0.
  - Output: **0**
- **Scenario 2:** If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.
  - `max(0, len(a) - 1)` is `len(a) - 1`.
  - Output: **len(a) - 1 (where len(a) is the length of the list `a`)**

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, the output will be:
- **0** if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
- **len(a) - 1** if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and both `st` and `end` are 0.

Since the exact values of `a`, `st`, and `end` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **0 or len(a) - 1 (where len(a) is the length of the list `a` and the output is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise it is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` are 0)**
