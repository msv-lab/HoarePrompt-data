Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
