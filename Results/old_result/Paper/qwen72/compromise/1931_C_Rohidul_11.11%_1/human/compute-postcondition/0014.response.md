Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `0 <= l < r`, `r` is `n` - 1, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The value of `n` remains equal to `t`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `l` is incremented until it reaches the largest index where `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is no longer true or `l` is no longer less than `r`.
- The variable `r` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `st` is incremented by the same number of times as `l`, reflecting the number of consecutive equal elements at the beginning of the list.
- The variable `end` remains 0.
