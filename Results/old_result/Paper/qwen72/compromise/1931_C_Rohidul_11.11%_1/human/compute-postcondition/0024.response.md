Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is less than `t - 1`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]` or `r` is `l`, `st` is the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all `0 <= st < r`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `n` remains equal to `t`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The value of `l` remains less than `t - 1`.
- The value of `r` is now the largest index in the list `a` where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, or it has reached `l`.
- The value of `st` remains the largest index such that `a[st] == a[st + 1]` for all indices less than `r`.
- The value of `end` is the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal.
