Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]`, `l` is 3, `r` is greater than 2, `st` is 3, `end` is 0, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**

Explanation: The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
