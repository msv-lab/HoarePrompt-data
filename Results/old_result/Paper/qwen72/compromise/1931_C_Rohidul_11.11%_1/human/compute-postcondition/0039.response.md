Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value 0 to both `st` and `end`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `ans`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
