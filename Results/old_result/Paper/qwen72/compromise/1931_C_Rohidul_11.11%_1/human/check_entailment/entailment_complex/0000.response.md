Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost in burles to make all elements of an array equal by applying a specific operation at most once. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Identifying Consecutive Equal Elements:**
   - The program uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to find the longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements.
   - `l` is incremented as long as `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`.
   - `r` is decremented as long as `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

3. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the program calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`. This is because the prefix and suffix can be extended to cover the entire array, and the remaining elements (if any) need to be set to the same value.
   - If `st` (number of consecutive elements from the beginning equal to `a[0]`) and `end` (number of consecutive elements from the end equal to `a[-1]`) are both zero and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, the program sets the cost to `len(a) - 1`. This means the entire array needs to be set to a single value.
   - Otherwise, the cost is calculated as `r - l`, which represents the length of the subarray that needs to be set to a single value.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated cost for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `6` (array size), `1 2 3 4 5 1` (array)
  - Output: `4`
  - Reason: The longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements are `[1]` and `[1]`. The remaining subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` needs to be set to a single value, which costs `4` burles.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `7` (array size), `1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (array)
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The entire array is already equal, so no operation is needed.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `8` (array size), `8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8` (array)
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements are `[8, 8, 8]` and `[8, 8, 8]`. The remaining subarray `[1, 2]` needs to be set to a single value, which costs `2` burles.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1` (array size), `1` (array)
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The array has only one element, so it is already equal.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `2` (array size), `1 2` (array)
  - Output: `1`
  - Reason: The array has two different elements, so setting one element to the other costs `1` burle.

- **Example 6:**
  - Input: `3` (array size), `1 2 3` (array)
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The array has three different elements, so setting the middle element to either `1` or `3` costs `2` burles.

- **Example 7:**
  - Input: `7` (array size), `4 3 2 7 1 1 3` (array)
  - Output: `6`
  - Reason: The longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements are `[3]` and `[3]`. The remaining subarray `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1]` needs to be set to a single value, which costs `6` burles.

- **Example 8:**
  - Input: `9` (array size), `9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3` (array)
  - Output: `7`
  - Reason: The longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements are `[9, 9]` and `[5, 5, 5, 3]`. The remaining subarray `[2, 9, 2, 5]` needs to be set to a single value, which costs `7` burles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem. It calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering the longest prefix and suffix of consecutive equal elements and the remaining subarray.

Correctness: **True**
