To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n)`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - In a `for` loop with `range(n)`, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`.

4. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input minus twice the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s + s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`**
