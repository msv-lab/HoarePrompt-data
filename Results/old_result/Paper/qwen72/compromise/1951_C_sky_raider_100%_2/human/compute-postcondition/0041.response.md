The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is `k - s - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `s + t`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t)`**
