Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `c` is 0.
- The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- The value of `l[i]` is `l[0]` because `i` is 0.
- The value of `t` is 0.
- Therefore, `c` is updated to `s * (l[0] + 0)`, which simplifies to `s * l[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
