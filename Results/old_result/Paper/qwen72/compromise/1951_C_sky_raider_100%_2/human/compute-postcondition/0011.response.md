The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` will be reduced by this minimum value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `k` is `k - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`.**
