The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. Here, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`. It returns the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints on daily purchases and ticket prices.**
