The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This changes the values of these variables from their initial states. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the impact:

- `n` is reassigned to the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is reassigned to the second integer read from the input.
- `k` is reassigned to the third integer read from the input.

The initial values of `i`, `l`, `t`, `s`, and `c` remain as they were before the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (initial value), `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `n * s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
