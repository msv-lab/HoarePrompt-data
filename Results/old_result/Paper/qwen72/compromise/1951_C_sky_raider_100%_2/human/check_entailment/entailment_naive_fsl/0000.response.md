Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the daily limit `m` and the price increase due to previous purchases affects the subsequent days' prices. Specifically, the program does not account for the price increase after purchasing tickets on a given day, which can lead to incorrect calculations of the total cost.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
15
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a different value because it does not correctly handle the price increase after each purchase.

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 1 each, total cost = 2, new prices = [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at 3 each, total cost = 2 + 6 = 8, new prices = [5, 6, 7]
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at 5, total cost = 8 + 5 = 13, new prices = [6, 7]

The total cost is 13, but the program will not correctly compute this due to the missing logic for price increases.
