Reasoning:  
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`). Sorting is a key step because it allows the program to always consider the lowest available price first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices and buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets at each step. It updates the total cost (`c`) and the cumulative increase in price (`t`) accordingly. This ensures that the program respects the constraints on daily purchases and the increasing price effect.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets bought on a day by the current price plus the cumulative increase (`l[i] + t`). This correctly accounts for the price increases due to previous purchases.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the execution summary, the program seems to handle all edge cases and constraints correctly, and it produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
