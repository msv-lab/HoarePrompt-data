To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is the typical initialization for a `range` loop in Python.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute based on the input value, which should be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
