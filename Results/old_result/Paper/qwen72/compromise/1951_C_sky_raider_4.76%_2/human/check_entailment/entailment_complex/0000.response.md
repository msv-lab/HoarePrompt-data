Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase \( k \) tickets over \( n \) days, given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the varying prices. Let's break down the logic and identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and the list of ticket prices \( l \).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices \( l \). This is a good approach because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will minimize the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to \( k \times k / 2 \). This initialization seems incorrect because it does not represent any meaningful value in the context of the problem. The correct initialization should be `c = 0`.

4. **Loop to Calculate Minimum Cost**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of \( m \) and the remaining \( k \).
   - The remaining \( k \) is updated by subtracting `s`.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding \( l[i] \times s - s \times s / 2 \). This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( l[i] \times s \) because the cost of buying `s` tickets at price \( l[i] \) is simply \( l[i] \times s \).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final cost `c` for each test case.

Given these observations, the program has several issues:
- Incorrect initialization of `c`.
- Incorrect formula for updating `c`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(c)
```

### Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version should be used instead.
