The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It applies the function `func_1` to each list of integers and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes `t` as the number of test cases, `n` as the last integer used in the loop, `a` as the last list of integers used in the loop, `data` as the original list of input strings, `idx` as the index after the last element used in the loop, and `results` as a list of `t` results from `func_1`.
