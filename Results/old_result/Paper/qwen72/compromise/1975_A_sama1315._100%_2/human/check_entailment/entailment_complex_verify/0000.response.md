Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning for both functions:

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that `a` is a list of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50, and each element is between 1 and 1,000,000. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Sorting and Concatenation**:
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: This creates a sorted version of the array `a`.
   - `concatenated_a = a + a`: This creates a new array that is the concatenation of `a` with itself. This is a clever approach because it allows us to check all possible splits and swaps of the original array.
3. **Checking Subarrays**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)`: This iterates over all possible starting points for a subarray of length `n` in `concatenated_a`.
   - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a`: This checks if the subarray starting at index `i` and of length `n` matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subarray is found, it means that the original array can be split and swapped to become sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Return Statement**:
   - If a matching subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - If no matching subarray is found after all iterations, the function returns 'No'.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `input = sys.stdin.read`: This reads all input data at once.
   - `data = input().split()`: This splits the input data into a list of strings.
   - `t = int(data[idx])`: This extracts the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The loop `for _ in range(t)`: This iterates over each test case.
   - `n = int(data[idx])`: This extracts the length of the array for the current test case.
   - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`: This extracts the array for the current test case and converts it to a list of integers.
   - `result = func_1(a)`: This calls `func_1` with the current array and stores the result.
   - `results.append(result)`: This appends the result to the `results` list.
3. **Output**:
   - `print('\n'.join(results))`: This prints each result on a new line.

### Annotations and State Validation:
- **Before `func_1` call**: The state is correctly described. `a` is a list of positive integers with the specified constraints.
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - The state after creating `sorted_a` and `concatenated_a` is correct.
  - The loop and the condition inside the loop are correctly described.
  - The state after the loop is also correct, where the function returns 'No' if no matching subarray is found.
- **Before `func_2` call**: The state is correctly described. `t` is the number of test cases, and the input data is correctly parsed and processed.
- **Inside `func_2`**:
  - The state after each operation is correctly described.
  - The final state and the output are correctly described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by splitting and swapping. The input handling and output are also correct. The original assessment is accurate, and the program works as expected for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
