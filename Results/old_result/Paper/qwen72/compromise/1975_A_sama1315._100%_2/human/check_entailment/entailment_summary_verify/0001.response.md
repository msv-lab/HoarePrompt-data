### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if an array `a` can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself. This is a clever trick to handle the circular nature of the problem, as any valid split and swap can be represented as a subarray of this concatenated array.
   - The function iterates over the possible starting indices `i` of the subarray in `concatenated_a` and checks if the subarray of length `n` starting at `i` is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'. If no such subarray is found after checking all possible starting indices, it returns 'No'.

   **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic is correct. By creating a concatenated array, the function simulates all possible ways to split and swap the array.
   - The check `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a` is a valid way to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by any number of split and swap operations.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes' if such a subarray is found and 'No' otherwise.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for reading input and handling multiple test cases.
   - It reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
   - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

   **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly handles the problem of determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by any number of split and swap operations.
  - The use of the concatenated array `a + a` is a clever and efficient way to simulate all possible splits and swaps.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It efficiently reads the entire input at once and parses it correctly.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
  - The results are printed correctly, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is sound, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
