The function `func` is described with specific constraints but lacks explicit parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context, it seems the function should accept parameters related to the constraints mentioned. These include the number of test cases (`t`), the number of nodes (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the number of queries (`k`). Additionally, for each edge, it should accept the nodes it connects (`a_i`, `b_i`) and the associated value (`f_i`).

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function likely processes these inputs to produce some form of result based on the graph and query data provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes (n), the number of edges (m), and the number of queries (k). For each test case, it also accepts a list of edges, where each edge is represented by two nodes (a_i, b_i) and a value (f_i). The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the queries provided for each test case.**
