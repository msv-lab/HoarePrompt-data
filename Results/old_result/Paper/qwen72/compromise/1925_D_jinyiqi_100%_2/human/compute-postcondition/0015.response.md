Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `m` is the number of iterations completed, `j` is `m - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `sum_f`, `m`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
