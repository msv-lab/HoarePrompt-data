Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `j` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` remain unchanged from their initial state.
