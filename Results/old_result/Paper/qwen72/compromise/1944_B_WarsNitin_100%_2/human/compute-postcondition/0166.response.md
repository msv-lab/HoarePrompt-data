Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is either `req - 2` or `req`, depending on whether `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, provided `k` is not `0` before the loop ends. If `k` is `0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and the state of `ans1` and `l` remains as described above. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`.***
