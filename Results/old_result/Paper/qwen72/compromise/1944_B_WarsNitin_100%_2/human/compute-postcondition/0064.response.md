Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `req` or `req - 2`. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice.***
