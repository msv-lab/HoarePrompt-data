Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `req - 2 * count_of_pairs`, `ans2` contains the repeated elements from `c` where `c[i] == c[i - 1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n - 1`:** The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- **`k` is `req - 2 * count_of_pairs`:** Each time the loop finds a pair of consecutive elements in `c` that are equal (`c[i] == c[i - 1]`), it appends the element twice to `ans2` and decreases `k` by 2. Therefore, `k` will be reduced by `2 * count_of_pairs`, where `count_of_pairs` is the number of such pairs found.
- **`ans2` contains the repeated elements from `c` where `c[i] == c[i - 1]`:** For each pair of consecutive elements in `c` that are equal, the element is appended twice to `ans2`.

The other variables (`n`, `c`, `ans1`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
