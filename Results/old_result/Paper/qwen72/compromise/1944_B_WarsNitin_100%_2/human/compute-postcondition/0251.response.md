Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`. If `b[3]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` now contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
