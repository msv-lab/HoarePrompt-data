Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m` (where `m` is the number of times the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true), `ans2` contains the values of `c[i]` repeated twice for each occurrence where `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, and the loop has completed all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` now includes the first element of `l`, `ans2` now includes the first element of `l`, `k` is decreased by 1, if `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` has at least two elements, `ans1` includes the first and second elements of `l`, `ans2` includes the first and second elements of `l`, `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` has at least three elements, `ans1` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `ans2` now includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
