The code snippet `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `q` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`
- `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end
- `ans1` is an empty list
- `ans2` is an empty list
- `k` is now equal to 2 times its original value
- `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`
- `l` is an empty list if the first element of `b` is equal to the second element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`
- The second-to-last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans1` now contains the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 2 times its original value, `req` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is an empty list if the first element of `b` is equal to the second element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`, the second-to-last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`.**
