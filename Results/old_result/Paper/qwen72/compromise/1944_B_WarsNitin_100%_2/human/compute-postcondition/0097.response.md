Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` has at least three elements, `ans1` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `ans2` now includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, and `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` was 0 before, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
