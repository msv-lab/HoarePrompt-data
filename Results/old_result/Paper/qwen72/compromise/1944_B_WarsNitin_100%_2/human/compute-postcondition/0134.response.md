Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` twice. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`, `k` is 0, and `b[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[1]`.***
