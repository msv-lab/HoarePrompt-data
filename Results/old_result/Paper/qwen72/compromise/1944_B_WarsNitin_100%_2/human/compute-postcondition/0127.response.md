The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, the value `b[1]` is added to `ans1`. The conditions regarding `n` being greater than 2, `k` being 0, and `b[i]` being equal to `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`.**
