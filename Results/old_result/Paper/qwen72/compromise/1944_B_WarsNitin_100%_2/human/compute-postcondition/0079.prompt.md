Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is now equal to `req`, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `req` or `req - 2`. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[i]` twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is either `req` or `req - 2`. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` includes the value of `c[2]` twice. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains as `req` or `req - 2`, and `ans2` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either `req` or `req - 2`. If `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, `k` is decremented by 2, and `ans2` includes the value of `c[3]` twice. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `k` is further decremented by 2, and `ans2` includes the value of `c[2]` twice. If `k` is 0, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains as `req - 2` or `req - 4`, and `ans2` does not change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
