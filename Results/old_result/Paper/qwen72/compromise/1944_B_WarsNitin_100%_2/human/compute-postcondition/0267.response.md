Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 0, `ans2` now contains the elements at index 2 of `c` appended to its previous content.** 

Explanation: The code appends the element at index 2 of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new element from `c` is added to `ans2`, which means `ans2` now includes this additional element.
