Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is the length of `l` minus 1, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k` (or 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`), `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the elements starting from the `n`-th element to the end, `req` is equal to the new value of `k`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]`. Otherwise, if `b[0] != b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`, and if `b[0] == b[1]`, `l` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is 0. If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is equal to `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`), `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is not equal to `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`), and `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is not equal to `b[i + 1]` (which is `b[2]`), `l` now includes the value of `b[1]`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the element at index 2 of `b` and the element at index 2 of `b`. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`. If `b[3]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `l` now contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
