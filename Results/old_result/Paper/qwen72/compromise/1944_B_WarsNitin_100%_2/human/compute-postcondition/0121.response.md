Postcondition: ***`i` is `-1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the element `b[n - 1]`. If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the last element of `b` (which is `b[n-1]`), and `k` is `-2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain empty lists, and `k` is `0`. `n` is an input integer, `req` is `0`, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `0`, `t` must be greater than `0`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, now sorted in ascending order.***
