Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 5000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2)), and a list a of 2n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50000.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has `len(l)` elements, `ans1` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `k` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `req` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is the length of `l` minus 1 (or the last index of `l`), `ans1` contains all the elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `ans2` contains the same elements as `ans1`, and `k` is 0. If `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which `k` became 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `k` is `req - 2 * count_of_pairs - len(l)`, `ans2` contains the repeated elements from `c` where `c[i] == c[i - 1]` and all elements of `l`, `ans1` now includes all elements of `l`. If `k` is 0, the loop would have broken earlier.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
