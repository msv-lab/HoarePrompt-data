Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -4, `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`. If `b[3] == b[2]`, `ans1` also includes the element at index 2 of `b`. If `b[3] != b[2]` and `b[3] != b[4]`, `l` is a list that includes the element `b[2]`. If `b[3] == b[4]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`.**
