Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[3]` equals `b[2]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` appended to its previous contents. If `b[3]` does not equal `b[2]`, and `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[3]` does not equal `b[4]`, `l` now contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `b[3]` equals `b[4]`, `l` remains unchanged.***
