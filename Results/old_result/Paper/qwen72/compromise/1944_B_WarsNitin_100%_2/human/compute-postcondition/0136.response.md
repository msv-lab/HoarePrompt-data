Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is either -2 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `b[1]` and `b[0]` or `b[2]` are not affected by this `break` statement, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
