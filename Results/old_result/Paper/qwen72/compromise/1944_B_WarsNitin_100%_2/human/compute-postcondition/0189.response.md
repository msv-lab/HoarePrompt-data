The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the list `ans1`.

- Initially, `i` is 1, so the second element of `l` (index 1) is appended to `ans1`.
- `ans1` originally contains the first element of `l`, so now it contains the first and second elements of `l`.
- `ans2` remains unchanged as it only contains the first element of `l` as its last element.
- `k` is `k - 1`, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this condition is not checked in the given code snippet, so `k` remains as `k - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `l` has at least one element, `ans1` contains the first and second elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` as its last element, and `k` is `k - 1`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
