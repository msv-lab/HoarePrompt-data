Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `req`, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, provided `k` is not `0` before the loop ends. If `k` is `0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `ans1` and `l` remains as described above. Additionally, the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`.**
