To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `len(l) - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
   - `k` is `req - 2 * count_of_pairs - len(l)`: This is a formula that calculates `k` based on `req`, `count_of_pairs`, and the length of `l`.
   - `ans2` contains the repeated elements from `c` where `c[i] == c[i - 1]` and all elements of `l`.
   - `ans1` now includes all elements of `l`.
   - If `k` is 0, the loop would have broken earlier.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `l` is a list of elements.
   - `ans1` is a list that includes all elements of `l`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*ans1)`: This will print all elements of `ans1` separated by spaces.

Given that `ans1` includes all elements of `l`, the output will be the elements of `l` printed in the same order they appear in `l`.

Output: **elements of l (where l is the list of elements included in ans1)**

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 3 4**
