The value of `b[i]` is appended to the list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The conditions that `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` also remain unchanged. The condition that if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 0 (if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement), `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.**
