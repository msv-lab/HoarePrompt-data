Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and a threshold `k`, followed by the health values of the monsters and their positions. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by using the minimum number of bullets required for each monster, without exceeding the time available based on the monster's position. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the time constraints, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
