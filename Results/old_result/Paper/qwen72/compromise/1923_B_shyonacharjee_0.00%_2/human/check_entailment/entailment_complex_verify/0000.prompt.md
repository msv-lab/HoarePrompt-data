You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The loop has processed each test case and printed 'YES' if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters does not exceed the time available for each monster, otherwise 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and a threshold `k`, followed by the health values of the monsters and their positions. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by using the minimum number of bullets required for each monster, without exceeding the time available based on the monster's position. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the time constraints, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the player can survive and kill all the monsters. Specifically, the condition `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if bullets_needed > time_available * k:`. This is because the player can fire up to `k` bullets per second, and the total number of bullets needed to kill a monster should be compared against the maximum number of bullets the player can fire in the available time (i.e., `time_available * k`).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-3 -2 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The player has 2 bullets per second.
- The monsters are at positions -3, -2, and -1 with healths 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- The player can survive and kill all the monsters as follows:
  - In the first second, the player can fire 2 bullets: 1 at the monster at -3 (killing it) and 1 at the monster at -2 (reducing its health to 1). The monster at -1 moves to -2.
  - In the second second, the player can fire 2 bullets: 1 at the monster at -2 (killing it) and 1 at the monster at -2 (reducing its health to 2). The monster at -2 moves to -1.
  - In the third second, the player can fire 2 bullets: 2 at the monster at -1 (killing it).

The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it does not correctly account for the number of bullets the player can fire per second.
