You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a list of four integers between 0 and 200. For each test case, it modifies the list such that all elements become even by subtracting their remainder when divided by 2. It then calculates and prints a result for each test case, which is the sum of the modified list divided by 2, plus 1 if the first three elements of the original list were all odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) is unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers (each integer is 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - The game is won by Bob if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the number of 2s, 4s are both even.
   - This is because:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 3 = 2\)
     - \(2 \oplus 4 = 6\)
   - Therefore, the XOR of the sequence will be zero if the counts of 1s and 3s are both even, and the counts of 2s and 4s are both even.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve should aim to make the counts of 1s, 3s, and 2s, 4s both even.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
   - It then applies a transformation to each count \( p_i \) using the lambda function \( \lambda x: int(x) - int(x) \% 2 \). This effectively rounds down each count to the nearest even number.
   - The program then checks if the sum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s (after rounding down) is odd. If it is, it adds 1 to the result.
   - Finally, it prints the result of \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 \).

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The transformation \( \lambda x: int(x) - int(x) \% 2 \) ensures that each count is rounded down to the nearest even number.
   - The condition \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) checks if the original counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result.
   - The final result \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 \) is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as it represents the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input \( 1, 1, 1, 0 \):
     - \( p = [0, 0, 0, 0] \)
     - \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 = 0 \)
     - \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) is True, so the result is \( 1 \).
   - For the input \( 1, 0, 1, 2 \):
     - \( p = [0, 0, 0, 2] \)
     - \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 = 1 \)
     - \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) is False, so the result is \( 1 \).
   - For the input \( 2, 2, 2, 0 \):
     - \( p = [2, 2, 2, 0] \)
     - \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 = 3 \)
     - \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) is False, so the result is \( 3 \).
   - For the input \( 3, 3, 2, 0 \):
     - \( p = [2, 2, 2, 0] \)
     - \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 = 3 \)
     - \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) is False, so the result is \( 3 \).
   - For the input \( 0, 9, 9, 9 \):
     - \( p = [0, 8, 8, 8] \)
     - \( \text{sum}(p) // 2 = 12 \)
     - \( \text{sum}(list(map(lambda x: x \% 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3 \) is False, so the result is \( 12 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the counts of 1s, 3s, and 2s, 4s are both even. Therefore, the program is correct.
