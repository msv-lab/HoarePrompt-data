### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then iterates through the list to process each test case. The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (length of the encoded string) and the string `b` (the encoded string).
   - This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking all distinct characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order.
   - The set of characters is correctly obtained using `set(encoded)`, and sorting ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order.
   - The mapping dictionary is created by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - The expression `r[-(i + 1)]` correctly maps the i-th character to the (len(r) - i - 1)-th character, which is the symmetric character in the sorted list.

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.
   - The use of a generator expression inside `join` is efficient and correct for constructing the decoded string.

4. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are collected in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.
   - This output format matches the problem requirements.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.
- It correctly states that `func_1` constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters from the encoded string.
- The mapping is created by pairing each character with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
- The final state of the program is that the original string `encoded` is transformed into a new string based on this mapping.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Reading:**
  - The program reads the input efficiently and processes it correctly.
- **Auxiliary String Construction:**
  - The construction of `r` is correct and follows the problem description.
- **Mapping Construction:**
  - The mapping is constructed correctly, ensuring that each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding:**
  - The decoding process is implemented correctly, using the mapping to replace each character in the encoded string.
- **Output:**
  - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem. It handles the input and output efficiently and constructs the auxiliary string and mapping correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
