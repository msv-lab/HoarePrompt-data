The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function checks the string `s` for the following conditions: if the count of '1' characters is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count is greater than 2 and odd, or exactly 1, it prints 'NO'; if the string contains the substring '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
