The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `start` and `end` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a variable that will be used to iterate over the range of `t`, starting from 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
