The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `password`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'NO' if a letter in the `password` is followed by a digit. If the loop completes all iterations without finding a letter followed by a digit, the function returns 'YES'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'NO' if any letter in the `password` is followed by a digit. If no such sequence is found, it returns 'YES'.**
