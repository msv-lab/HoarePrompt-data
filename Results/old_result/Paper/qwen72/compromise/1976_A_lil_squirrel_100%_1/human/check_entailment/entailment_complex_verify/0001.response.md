### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Characters**:
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - This is done using a loop that checks if each character is a digit or a letter and appends it to the respective list.
   - The separation logic is correct and ensures that `letters` contains only letters and `digits` contains only digits.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
   - The sorting checks are correct and ensure that both `letters` and `digits` are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Order of Characters**:
   - The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit.
   - If such a pair is found, the function returns 'NO'.
   - The order check is correct and ensures that no digit follows a letter.

5. **Final Return**:
   - If all the conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'YES'.
   - The final return logic is correct and ensures that the function returns 'YES' only if all conditions are met.

### Analysis of the Provided Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `12ac`
  - `letters = ['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - `digits = ['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `123wa`
  - `letters = ['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
  - `digits = ['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `allllmost`
  - `letters = ['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - `digits = []` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `ac123`
  - `letters = ['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - `digits = ['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Digit '1' comes after a letter 'c'.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `011679`
  - `letters = []` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - `digits = ['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - No letter comes before a digit.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the provided test cases. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution and that the logic for checking the conditions is sound.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
