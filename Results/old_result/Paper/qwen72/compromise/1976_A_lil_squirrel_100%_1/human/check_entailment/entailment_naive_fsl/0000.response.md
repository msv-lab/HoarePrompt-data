Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions:

1. **Character Type Check**: The program separates the characters into two lists, `letters` and `digits`, which ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
3. **Order of Characters**: It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all potential edge cases, including:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with both letters and digits, ensuring that letters are sorted before any digits.
- Passwords of different lengths (from 1 to 20).

Given these checks, the program should work correctly for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
