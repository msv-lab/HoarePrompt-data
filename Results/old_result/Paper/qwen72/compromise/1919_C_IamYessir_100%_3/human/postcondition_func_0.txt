The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `lit` of `n` integers. It then populates two lists, `a` and `b`, with elements from `lit` based on specific conditions. After processing, it calculates the total count of elements in `a` and `b` that are greater than their preceding elements and prints this count. The function does not return any value. The state after the function concludes is that `a` and `b` are lists populated according to the conditions, and `s` is the count of increasing elements in these lists. The values of `n`, `lit`, and the loop counter `_` remain unchanged.
