Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. Otherwise, the value of `lit[i]` is not appended to either list.***
