Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `s` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, and `x` is updated to the value of `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y` (both are infinity), `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty. If `x` is less than `y` and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and `b` remains empty or unchanged. If `lit[0]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If none of the conditions are met, the lists and variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, and `y >= lit[1]`, the list `b` now includes the integer from `lit` at index 1 as its last element. If `y < lit[1]` and `lit[1] > x`, the list `b` now includes the integer at index 1 of `lit`. If `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[1]`. If `x <= y`, and `x == y`, `x` is set to `lit[1]` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[1]`, `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `lit[1] > y` and `x < lit[1]`, `x` is set to `lit[1]`. Otherwise, if `y >= lit[1]` and `lit[1] > x`, `lit[1]` is appended to the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` and `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `len(b) > 0`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[2]`, `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2, and `y` is updated to this value. If `x > y` and `y < lit[2]`, and `lit[2] > x`, `b` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit` as its last element, and `y` is updated to this value. If `x > y` and `lit[2] <= x` and `lit[2] > y`, the list `a` now includes the integer at index 2 of `lit` as its last element. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, no further changes are made. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[2]`, `a` includes the `i`-th element of `lit` as its last element. If `lit[2] > y`, the last element of `a` is now `lit[2]`. If `lit[2] <= y` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` now contains the integer from `lit` at index 2 as its last element. If `len(b) == 1`, `y` is set to the integer from `lit` at index 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
