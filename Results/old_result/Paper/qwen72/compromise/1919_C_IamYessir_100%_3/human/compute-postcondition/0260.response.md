The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the value of `lit[i]` to the end of the list `a`. This operation changes the last element of `a` to `lit[i]`, which updates the value of `x` to `lit[i]` since `x` is the last element of `a`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `a` and `b` are still lists.
- `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are still integers.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `lit` is still a list of integers provided by user input.
- `_` is still incremented by 1.
- If `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is now `lit[i]`.
- If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`.
- The current value of `x` is still greater than the current value of `y`.
- `y` is still less than `lit[i]`.
- The value of `lit[i]` is still less than or equal to the updated value of `x`.
- The updated value of `x` is still greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is still greater than the current value of `y`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `x` is now `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity, `x` is greater than `y`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
