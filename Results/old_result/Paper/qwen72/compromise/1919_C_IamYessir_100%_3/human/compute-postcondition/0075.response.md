Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. `y` is the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `y`.
