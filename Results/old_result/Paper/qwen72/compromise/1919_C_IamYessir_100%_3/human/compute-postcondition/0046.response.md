Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` > `y`, then: if `y` >= `lit[i]`, `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `x` >= `lit[i]` > `y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is the last element of `b` (if `b` is non-empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If none of these conditions are met, `x` remains greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`, with `lit[i]` being less than or equal to `x`. If `x` <= `y`, then: if `x` == `y`, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` < `y`, and `x` >= `lit[i]`, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, with `x` being less than `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `x` < `lit[i]` < `y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `lit[i]` <= `y`, `b` is a non-empty list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain as they were, with `x` being less than `y` and `lit[i]` being between `x` and `y` (inclusive).**
