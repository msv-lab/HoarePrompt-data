Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `x <= y`, and `x == y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is set to infinity, `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `len(b) > 0`, otherwise `y` is set to infinity. If `x != y` and `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, or if `lit[i] > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`. If `x >= y`, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
