Output State: **`a` and `b` are empty lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged, `x` is set to infinity, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.** 

Since `b` is not empty, `y` is assigned the value of the last element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
