Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')`, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is set to `float('inf')`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The value of `x` is still determined based on the length of list `a`: if `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
