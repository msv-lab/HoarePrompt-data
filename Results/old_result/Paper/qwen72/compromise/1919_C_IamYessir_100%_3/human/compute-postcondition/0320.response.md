Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value `lit[i]` to the list `a`.
- The initial state conditions remain unchanged except for the modification to the list `a`.
- `i` is still incremented by 1, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and `_` is still incremented by 1.
- The values of `x` and `y` are still determined based on the lengths of `a` and `b` as described in the initial state.
