Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity.**

The code snippet assigns the value of infinity to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` being infinity if `lit` is empty, or the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty.
