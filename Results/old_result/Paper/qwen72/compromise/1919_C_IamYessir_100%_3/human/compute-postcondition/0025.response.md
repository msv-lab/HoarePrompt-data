Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing the integer `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is the last element of `b` (if `b` is non-empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and `x` is still greater than `y`, with `y` being less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` being less than or equal to `x`.**
