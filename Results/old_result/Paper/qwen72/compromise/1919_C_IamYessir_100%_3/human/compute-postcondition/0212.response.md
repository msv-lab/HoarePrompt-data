Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged.**

The code snippet `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0. The initial state indicates that `s` was already 0, so this assignment does not change the value of `s`. The other variables and lists (`a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
