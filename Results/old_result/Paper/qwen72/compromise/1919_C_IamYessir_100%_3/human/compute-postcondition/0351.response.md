Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, `n` is the input integer, `cp` and `_` are integers, `_` is incremented by `n`, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, `s` is incremented by 1.***
