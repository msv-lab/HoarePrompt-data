Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are empty lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `b` is empty, `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
