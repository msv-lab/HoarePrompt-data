Output State: **`a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is a list, `i` is 2, `s` is 1 or 2 (depending on the comparison of the first and second elements of `a`), `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially 0 or 1, it is now 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
