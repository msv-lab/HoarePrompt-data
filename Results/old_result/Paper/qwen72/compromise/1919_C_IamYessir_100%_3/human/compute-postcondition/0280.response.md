Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now contains `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is equal to `y`, the state remains unchanged.**
