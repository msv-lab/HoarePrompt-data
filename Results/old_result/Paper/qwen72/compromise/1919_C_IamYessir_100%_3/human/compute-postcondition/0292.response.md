Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The element `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1`, so the element being appended is `lit[i + 1]`.
- The other variables (`b`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, `_`, `y`, and `x`) are not directly affected by this code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
