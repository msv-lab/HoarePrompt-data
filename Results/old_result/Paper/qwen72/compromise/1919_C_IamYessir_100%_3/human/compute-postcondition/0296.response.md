Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1`, but this is already part of the initial state.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is unchanged, and its value is determined by the initial state conditions.
- The value of `x` is unchanged, and its value is determined by the initial state conditions.
- The list `b` remains unchanged.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged.
- The integer `_` is incremented by 1, as stated in the initial state.
- The initial state conditions about `n` being greater than `i + 1` and the values of `x` and `y` based on the lengths of `a` and `b` remain valid.
