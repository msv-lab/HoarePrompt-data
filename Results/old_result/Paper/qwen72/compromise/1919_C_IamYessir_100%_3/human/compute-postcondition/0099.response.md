The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the list `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
