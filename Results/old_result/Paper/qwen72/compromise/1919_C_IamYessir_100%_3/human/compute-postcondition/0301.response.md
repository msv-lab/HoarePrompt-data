Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. Otherwise, if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.***
