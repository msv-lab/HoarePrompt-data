Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `i` is 1, and `rem` is 0. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[1]`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, `y` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
