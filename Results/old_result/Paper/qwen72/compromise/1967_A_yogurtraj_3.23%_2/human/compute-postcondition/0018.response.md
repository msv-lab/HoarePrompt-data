To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` being 1 is still less than `n - 1` if `n` is greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2

### Final State:
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is either `a[0] + k // 1` or the second element of `a`, `rem` is either `k % 1` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (a[1] - a[0])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
