Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0.** 

The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `rem`.
