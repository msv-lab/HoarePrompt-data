Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `ii` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `k` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `k // n` is 0.
   - Therefore, `r` simplifies to `a[n - 1]`.

2. **Expression to Print**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substituting `r` with `a[n - 1]`, the expression becomes `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - Let's denote the last element of the list `a` as `a[n - 1]`.
   - The expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1` will be evaluated based on the value of `a[n - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`)**
