Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, and `y` is `n - 2`.**
