### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - We start with a set of cards where each card has a number from 1 to `n`, and we can buy up to `k` additional cards.
   - The goal is to rearrange the cards to achieve the maximum score.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The algorithm sorts the initial counts of cards `a` and tries to balance the counts by buying cards.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates how many cards of each type are needed to make the counts more uniform.
   - If the required number of cards exceeds the available coins `k`, it stops and calculates the maximum score based on the current state.
   - If there are remaining coins after making the counts as uniform as possible, it uses them to further increase the count of the most frequent card.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases, and for each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the initial counts `a`.
   - **Sorting**: Sort the initial counts `a` to facilitate the balancing process.
   - **Balancing Loop**: Iterate through the sorted counts and calculate the number of cards needed to make the counts uniform.
     - If the required number of cards exceeds `k`, update the counts and break the loop.
     - Otherwise, subtract the required number of cards from `k` and update the current count `r`.
   - **Final Calculation**:
     - If `k` is not zero after the loop, use the remaining coins to further increase the count of the most frequent card.
     - Calculate the maximum score based on the final counts and print the result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases such as when `k` is zero or when the initial counts are already balanced.
   - It ensures that the final score is calculated correctly even if the counts are not perfectly balanced.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
   - The balancing loop runs in \(O(n)\) time.
   - Overall, the algorithm is efficient and should handle the constraints within the given limits.
