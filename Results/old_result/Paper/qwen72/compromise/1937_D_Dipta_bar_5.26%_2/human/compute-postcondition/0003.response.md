The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, because `i` will start at 0 and the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Since `i` is initialized by the loop itself, we do not need to adjust its initial state. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list**
