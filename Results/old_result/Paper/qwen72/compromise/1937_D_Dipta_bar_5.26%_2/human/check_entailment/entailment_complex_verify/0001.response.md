### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the `i`-th cell will move left or right based on the character.
   - The grid character is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the grid length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - The output should be the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the cumulative time for pinballs starting from cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
   - `A` is used for cells with '>', and `B` is used for cells with '<'.
   - The program then iterates through each cell and calculates the time to leave the grid using the precomputed values.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Precomputation:**
     - `A` is computed for cells with '>', where each element in `A` represents the cumulative time for the pinball to move from the current cell to the next cell with '>'.
     - `B` is computed for cells with '<', where each element in `B` represents the cumulative time for the pinball to move from the current cell to the next cell with '<'.
   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each cell `i`, the program checks if the character is '>'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is '<', it calculates the time using the precomputed values in `B` and `A`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely filled with '<' or '>'.
   - It also handles the case where the pinball is placed on the first or last cell.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The precomputation step takes O(n) time for each test case.
   - The query handling step also takes O(n) time for each test case.
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

7. **Correctness:**
   - **Precomputation:**
     - The precomputation for `A` and `B` is correct. `A` and `B` are built by iterating through the string `s` and accumulating the time based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
   - **Query Handling:**
     - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid for each cell is complex but appears to be correct. The program correctly handles the transitions between '>' and '<' characters and the inversion of the grid.
   - **Output:**
     - The output format matches the problem description, and the program prints the results for each cell in the correct order.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- **State After Precomputation:**
  - `A` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '>' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '<' character.
  - `idx_A` is a list of indices where each '>' character is located in the string `s`.
  - `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '>' character in reverse order.
  - `idx_B` is a list of indices where each '<' character is located in the string `s` in reverse order.
- **State After Query Handling:**
  - `l` is the number of '>' characters in `s`.
  - `r` is the length of `B` minus the number of '<' characters in `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly precomputes the cumulative times for both '>' and '<' characters and handles the calculations for each cell to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. The logic is sound and the output format matches the problem description.

Final: **True**
