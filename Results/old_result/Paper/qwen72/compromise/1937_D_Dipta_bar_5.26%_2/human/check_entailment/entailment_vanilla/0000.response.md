### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the `i`-th cell will move left or right based on the character.
   - The grid character is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the grid length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - The output should be the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the cumulative time for pinballs starting from cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
   - `A` is used for cells with '>', and `B` is used for cells with '<'.
   - The program then iterates through each cell and calculates the time to leave the grid using the precomputed values.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Precomputation:**
     - `A` is computed for cells with '>', where each element in `A` represents the cumulative time for the pinball to move from the current cell to the next cell with '>'.
     - `B` is computed for cells with '<', where each element in `B` represents the cumulative time for the pinball to move from the current cell to the next cell with '<'.
   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each cell `i`, the program checks if the character is '>'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is '<', it calculates the time using the precomputed values in `B` and `A`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely filled with '<' or '>'.
   - It also handles the case where the pinball is placed on the first or last cell.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The precomputation step takes O(n) time for each test case.
   - The query handling step also takes O(n) time for each test case.
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

7. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly precomputes the cumulative times for both '>' and '<' characters.
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid for each cell is correct and handles all edge cases.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.
