Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` now contains one less element than before but must still contain at least one element, `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is now equal to the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x` and the program flow remains unchanged.**
