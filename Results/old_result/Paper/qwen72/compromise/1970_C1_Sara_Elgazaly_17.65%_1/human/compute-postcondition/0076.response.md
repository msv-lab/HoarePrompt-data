The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u_1`, and a list of edges representing a tree. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `t` is an integer and is always 1.
- `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\).
- `u_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\).
- The tree is represented by a list of edges (u, v) and has exactly two leaves.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it can be inferred that the function is designed to work with these parameters and the tree structure to produce some result. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters and the expected context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `u_1`, and a list of edges representing a tree. It is designed to work with these inputs, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is always 1, `u` and `v` are node indices, and `u_1` is another node index. The tree has exactly two leaves. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
