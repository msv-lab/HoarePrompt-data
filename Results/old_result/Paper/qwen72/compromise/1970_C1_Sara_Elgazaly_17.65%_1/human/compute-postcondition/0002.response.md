To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `x` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is 1
- `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n
- `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user
- `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop condition is met. Specifically, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values**
