The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `x`. The loop can execute again if `x - 1` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must have been greater than 1 for the loop to have executed. After one iteration, `x - 1` is reduced by 1, so `x` is now effectively `x - 1`.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, we do not need to adjust it. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 1 after the decrement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 2, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as the last element, `lst[b]` now contains `a` as the last element.**
