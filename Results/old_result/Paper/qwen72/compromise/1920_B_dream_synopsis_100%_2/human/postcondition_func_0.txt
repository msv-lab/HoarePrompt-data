The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of `n` integers, sorts it in descending order, and calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after applying the removal and multiplication operations. The function outputs the maximum sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the results for each test case.
