The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` remains the new user-provided integer.
- `k` remains the new user-provided non-negative integer.
- `x` remains the new user-provided integer.
- `a` remains the reversed list of integers provided by the user input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements initially, and now it contains one more element, which is the current value of `sums`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original two elements plus the current value of `sums`), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
