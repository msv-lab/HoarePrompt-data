The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to the previous value of `sums`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.**
