The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` after converting them to integers.

- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` is 0.
- After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are set to the integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers provided by the user input.**
