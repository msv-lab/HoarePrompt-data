The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i`, and the constants `k` and `1`. The loop condition is `i < k + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as this is what happens when the loop progresses to the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
- If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be less than `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` (if `i` was not 0) or `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` (if `i` was 0), `sums` is updated based on the conditions described, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
