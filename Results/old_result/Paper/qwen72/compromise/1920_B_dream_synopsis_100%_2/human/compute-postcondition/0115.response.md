Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new user-provided integer
- `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative
- `x` is the new user-provided integer
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements
  - If `i` is 0, the first element of `ans` remains unchanged, and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
  - If `i` is not 0, the first element of `ans` remains unchanged, and the second element is the updated value of `sums`
- If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`
- If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k - 1]`

### Code Snippet:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1]
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it.

### Calculation:
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`
- Since `i` is `k + 1`, `i - 1` is `k`
- Therefore, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k]`

### Updated State:
- `sums` is now `sums + a[k]`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, and `sums` is `sums + a[k]`.**
