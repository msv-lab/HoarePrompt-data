The code snippet calculates the value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. Let's break down the impact:

- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, but it is reversed.
- `x` is the number of elements from the beginning of the reversed list `a` that will be used in the calculation.
- `sum(a[:x])` computes the sum of the first `x` elements of the reversed list `a`.
- `2 * sum(a[:x])` doubles this sum.
- `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` assigns the result of the subtraction to `sums`.

Since the only variable being updated is `sums`, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
