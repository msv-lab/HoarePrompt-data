Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` followed by the new value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the new value of `sums` after the update.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
