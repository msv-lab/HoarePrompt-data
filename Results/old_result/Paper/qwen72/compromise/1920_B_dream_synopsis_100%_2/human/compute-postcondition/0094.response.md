Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
