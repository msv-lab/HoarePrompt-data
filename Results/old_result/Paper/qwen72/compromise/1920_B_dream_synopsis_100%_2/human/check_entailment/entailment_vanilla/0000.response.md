### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This ensures that the largest elements are considered first when Alice removes elements and when Bob multiplies elements by -1.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` from 0 to `k` (inclusive), where `i` represents the number of elements Alice removes.
   - For each `i`:
     - If `i` is 0, the sum is adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements (since Bob will multiply these by -1).
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the sum is adjusted by adding the `i-1`th element and subtracting twice the `i + x - 1`th element.
     - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum is adjusted by adding the `i-1`th element.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The maximum value from the list `ans` is printed for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players play optimally.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Strategy:**
  - Alice's strategy is to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
  - Bob's strategy is to multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
  - The function correctly considers the optimal moves for both players by iterating over possible removals and adjustments.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` is 0, and when the array has only one element.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, and the main loop runs in \(O(k)\) time, making the overall complexity manageable within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
