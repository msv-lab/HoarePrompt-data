To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This is the loop counter, and it will start at 0 by default, as per the `range` function in Python.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This is the upper limit for the loop, which determines how many times the loop will run. According to the problem statement, this value should be `t`, where 1 <= t <= 100.

To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the input is within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
