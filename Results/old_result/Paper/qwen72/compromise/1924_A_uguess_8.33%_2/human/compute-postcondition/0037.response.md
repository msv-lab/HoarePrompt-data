Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1, `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
