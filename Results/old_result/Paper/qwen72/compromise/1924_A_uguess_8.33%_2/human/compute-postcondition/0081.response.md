Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1 because `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented.
- `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters).
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is not conditional and will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
