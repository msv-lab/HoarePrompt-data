The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
