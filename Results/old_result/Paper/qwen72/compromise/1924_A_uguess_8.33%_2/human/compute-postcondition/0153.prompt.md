You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), n and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is the number of iterations that have been completed, `n` and `k` are the final input integers from the last iteration, `m` is the final input integer from the last iteration, `s` is the final input string from the last iteration, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1 for the last iteration, and `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s` for the last iteration. If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the current value of `cnt` remains unchanged and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, and `ans` is now extended by `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a string `s` of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and it may use or rely on the integers `t` and `n` within their specified ranges, but the exact return value is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
