Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, and `ans` is a string that has been updated according to the rules defined in the initial state.**

### Explanation:
- **`cur`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `cur` will be 0. This is because every time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1` (indicating that all `k` distinct characters have been seen), `cnt` is incremented and `cur` is reset to 0.
- **`cnt`**: The value of `cnt` will be the number of times the loop encountered a sequence of `k` distinct characters in the string `s`. Each time all `k` distinct characters are seen, `cnt` is incremented.
- **`ans`**: The string `ans` will be updated according to the rules defined in the initial state. Specifically, for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented, `ans` will have `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' appended. If `cnt` was less than `n` and the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` was not set, `ans` will have `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by `tmp` (which is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` was not set), and then `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a'. The final state of `ans` will reflect these updates based on the number of times `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented.

The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
