Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. The other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` and the potential update to `cur` are not affected by this assignment, so the value of `cur` is now 0.
