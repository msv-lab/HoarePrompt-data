The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `tmp` does not directly affect the loop's ability to start, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
