Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` distinct characters appear consecutively in `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to a string that consists of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
- `cur`, `cnt`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `cnt` is less than `n` is still valid.
