Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `t` must be greater than `k`, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is now extended by `n - 1` occurrences of the character 'a' for each time `cnt` was less than `n` before being incremented if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp` and then `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of the character 'a', where `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << (k-1) == 0`). Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is now 0 and `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the third character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cnt` is unchanged unless `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, in which case `cnt` is increased by 1, and `cur` is updated to 0 if `cur == (1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
