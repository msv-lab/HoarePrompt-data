Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set, `cur` is updated to `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`.**
