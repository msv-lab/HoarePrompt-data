Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is now `cur` + (1 << `cur_ss`), `cnt` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding the result of the bitwise left shift operation `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
