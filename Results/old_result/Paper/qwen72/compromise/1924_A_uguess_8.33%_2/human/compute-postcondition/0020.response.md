Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0.**

The initial state is updated to reflect that `cur` is now set to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
