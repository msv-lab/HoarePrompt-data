Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, and the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`).**
