Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `i` is `k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp`, `cur` is 0 if the loop has encountered a `cur` value equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the last iteration, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the unique characters in `s` (considering only the first `k` unique characters), `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the `(k-1)`-th bit of `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << (k-1) == 0`). Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `tmp` to it.
- If `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, then `ans` will now contain `cnt` occurrences of this character followed by one more occurrence of this character.
- If `tmp` is an empty string, then `ans` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, and `cnt`) retain their initial values.
