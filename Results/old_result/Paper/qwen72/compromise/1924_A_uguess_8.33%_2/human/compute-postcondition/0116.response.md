Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `s` remains a non-empty input string.
- `ss` remains the second character of `s`.
- `cur_ss` is now the integer value of the second character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'. This is calculated using the `ord` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character, and then subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'.
- `cur` and `cnt` are not affected by the code snippet provided.
