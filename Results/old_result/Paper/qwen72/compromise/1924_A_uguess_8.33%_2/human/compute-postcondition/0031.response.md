Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has set all bits from 0 to `k-1` in `cur` to 1.
- `cur` is the final value of the bitwise representation after processing all characters in `s`.
- If `cur` was set to `(1 << k) - 1` at any point, it was reset to 0, and `cnt` was incremented.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The condition that `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` suggests that some condition in the program has been met, which is why the `print` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state, as long as the condition that `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` is satisfied.

Output: **YES**
