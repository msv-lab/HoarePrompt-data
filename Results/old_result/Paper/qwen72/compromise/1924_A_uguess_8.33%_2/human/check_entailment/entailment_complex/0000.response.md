### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which is intended to count the number of times a subsequence of length `n` with all `k` distinct characters is found.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is a bitmask used to track the presence of the first `k` characters in the current subsequence.
   - The program iterates over each character in `s`:
     - It calculates the position of the character in the alphabet (`cur_ss`).
     - It checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`. If not, it sets the bit.
     - If all `k` bits are set in `cur`, it increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, it prints 'YES'.
     - If false, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - It constructs a string `ans` with `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
       - It checks for the first character that is not present in the current `cur` and appends it to `ans`.
       - It pads `ans` with `n - cnt - 1` occurrences of 'a'.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Bitmask Usage:**
     - The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence, but it is not correctly reset to 0 when a new subsequence starts. Instead, it is reset to 0 only when all `k` bits are set.
     - This means that `cur` might not accurately represent the current subsequence, leading to incorrect counting.
   - **Subsequence Check:**
     - The program does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
     - The logic for constructing the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. It constructs a string based on the final value of `cur`, which might not be the correct approach.
   - **Output Construction:**
     - The construction of the string `ans` is not correct. It should be a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of them is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print 'NO' followed by that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print 'YES'.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` and does not correctly construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
