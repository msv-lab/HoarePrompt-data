Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `0` if `n` is even, or `n-1` and `1` if `n` is odd.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is an integer greater than 1. For example, `n` could be 5.
2. **`i`**: This is `n-1`. If `n` is 5, then `i` is 4.
3. **`answer`**: This is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `n` is 5, then `answer` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. **`a`**: This list is defined based on whether `n` is even or odd.
   - If `n` is even, `a` contains `n` and `0`.
   - If `n` is odd, `a` contains `n-1` and `1`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(*answer)` statement will unpack the list `answer` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n` is 5:
  - `answer` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - The print statement will output: `1 2 3 4 5`.

- If `n` is 6:
  - `answer` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - The print statement will output: `1 2 3 4 5 6`.

### General Case:
- For any integer `n` greater than 1, the list `answer` will contain the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The print statement will output these integers separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than 1 and the list contains all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
