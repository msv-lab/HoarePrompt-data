The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends an element from the `array` to the `answer` list. The element appended is determined by the index `a[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `a`. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `answer`, `array`, or `a`, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `answer` has a new element appended from `array` at the index `a[-1]`.**
