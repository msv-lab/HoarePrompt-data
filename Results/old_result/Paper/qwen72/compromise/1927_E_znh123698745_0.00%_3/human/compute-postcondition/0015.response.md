The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `a` is the same as `array`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `answer` is a list containing the last element of `array`, which is `n`.

The last element of `array` (which is `n`) is decremented by 1, so the new value of the last element of `array` is `n - 1`. The `answer` list, which initially contained the value `n`, is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the value `n`.**
