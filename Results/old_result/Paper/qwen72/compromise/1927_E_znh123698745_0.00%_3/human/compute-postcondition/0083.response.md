Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which determines the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` and `k` are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is even. It then generates and prints a list `answer` of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, alternating between the first and last elements of a sequence. The function does not return any value; it only prints the `answer` list for each test case. After the function concludes, the `answer` list for each test case contains the integers from 1 to `n` in the specified alternating order. **
