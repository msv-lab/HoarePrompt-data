To determine what will be printed by the `print(*answer)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is an input integer. It represents the upper limit of the range of integers from 1 to `n` that will be used in the list `array`.

2. **`k`**: This is another input integer. It is not directly used in the `print` statement, but it might be used in the logic to determine the order of elements in the `answer` list.

3. **`i`**: This is defined as `n-1`. It is not directly used in the `print` statement, but it might be used in the logic to determine the order of elements in the `answer` list.

4. **`answer`**: This is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order. The specific order is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can only describe it as a list of integers from 1 to `n` in some order.

5. **`a`**: This is a list containing the integers `n` and `0` respectively. It is not directly used in the `print` statement.

6. **`array`**: This is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. It is not directly used in the `print` statement, but it might be used to initialize or manipulate the `answer` list.

Given the `print(*answer)` statement, it will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces. Since the specific order of the elements in `answer` is not provided, we can only describe the output as the integers from 1 to `n` in some specific order.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where the integers are in a specific order determined by the logic of the program)**
