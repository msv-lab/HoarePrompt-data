Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, `answer` has a new element appended from `array` at the index `a[-1] - 1`, and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `answer` has one additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.***
