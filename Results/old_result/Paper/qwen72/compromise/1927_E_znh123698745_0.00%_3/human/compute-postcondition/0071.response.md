Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, but the first element (index 0) is now `1 + 1` which equals `2`, `answer` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the integer at index `a[0]` of `array` (which is now `2`).**
