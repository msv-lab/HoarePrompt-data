The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index `a[0]` of the `array` to the list `answer`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 2 and `i` is 2. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code. However, the list `answer` is modified by adding the element from `array` at the index `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list that now includes the element at index `a[0]` of `array`.**
