Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.** 

The code snippet `answer = [1]` updates the `answer` list to contain only the integer 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `array`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
