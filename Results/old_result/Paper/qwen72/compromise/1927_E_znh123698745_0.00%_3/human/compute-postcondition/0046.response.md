The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3**
