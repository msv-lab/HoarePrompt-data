Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing the value `n` and the element `array[n-1]`. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing the value `n` and the element `array[1]`, and `array[0]` is incremented by 1.***
