You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n and k are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all iterations, and for each iteration, the `answer` list contains the integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, which alternates between the first and last elements of the `array` list. The `a` list contains the integers `n` and `0` respectively, and the `array` list remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which determines the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` and `k` are integers, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is even. It then generates and prints a list `answer` of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, alternating between the first and last elements of a sequence. The function does not return any value; it only prints the `answer` list for each test case. After the function concludes, the `answer` list for each test case contains the integers from 1 to `n` in the specified alternating order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not always construct a k-level permutation as required by the problem description. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
A permutation of length 4 where the sums of all continuous segments of length 2 differ by no more than 1. For example:
```
1 2 3 4
```
In this permutation, the sums of the segments are:
- \(1 + 2 = 3\)
- \(2 + 3 = 5\)
- \(3 + 4 = 7\)

The maximum sum is 7 and the minimum sum is 3, and the difference is 4, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this permutation is not a 2-level permutation.

**Actual Output:**
The program will output:
```
1 4 2 3
```
In this permutation, the sums of the segments are:
- \(1 + 4 = 5\)
- \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- \(2 + 3 = 5\)

The maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 5, and the difference is 1, which is correct for this specific case. However, the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input:
```
1
6 4
```

The program will output:
```
1 6 2 5 3 4
```

The sums of the segments of length 4 are:
- \(1 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 14\)
- \(6 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 16\)
- \(2 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 14\)

The maximum sum is 16 and the minimum sum is 14, and the difference is 2, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this permutation is not a 4-level permutation.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
