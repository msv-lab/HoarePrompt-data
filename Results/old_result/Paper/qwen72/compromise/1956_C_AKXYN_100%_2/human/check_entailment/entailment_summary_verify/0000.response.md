### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either set an entire row or an entire column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \) because the sum of the integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix with each row containing the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It calculates a result `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the result `res` and \( 2n \) (which is \( n \) shifted left by 1 bit).
   - It then prints a series of operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations, using the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each operation.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function creates an \( n \times n \) matrix with each row containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It calculates a result `res` using a specific formula.
   - It prints the result and \( 2n \) operations, each using the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all potential cases.
   - It provides an example where \( n = 2 \) and the program's output does not match the expected maximum sum.

5. **Verification**:
   - **Correctness of the Result `res`**:
     - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) does not directly correspond to the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
     - For \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum is \( 2^2 \times \frac{2 + 1}{2} = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \), not 7.

   - **Correctness of the Operations**:
     - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations, using the same permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each operation.
     - These operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations:
       - Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [1, 2]
       - Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [1, 2]
       - Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [1, 2]
       - Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [1, 2]
     - Result in the matrix:
       ```
       1 2
       1 2
       ```
     - The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The operations it prints do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
