### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column will be filled with this permutation, the total sum will be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes a matrix \( mat \) with rows filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It calculates the maximum sum \( res \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \). However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it performs a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The operations are valid and will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in each row and column.
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program performs the operations correctly to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in each row and column, but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
