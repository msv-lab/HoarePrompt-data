The loop head in the given task is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop is controlled by the value of the expression `int(input())`, which specifies the number of times the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` is not used in the body, so it does not affect the state. The only state that can be adjusted is the number of iterations remaining, which is determined by the value of `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1
- `i` is 0

Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, and the loop variable `_` is not used, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations remaining. After one iteration, the number of iterations remaining is `int(input()) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0, the loop will execute `int(input()) - 1` more times**
