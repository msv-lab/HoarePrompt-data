Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and \(n\) must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n-2\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement uses string formatting to print the string `'1 %d'` where `%d` is replaced by the value of `i`.
   - `i` is defined as \(n-2\). Therefore, the string will be `'1 %d' % (n-2)`, which simplifies to `'1 n-2'` where `n-2` is the actual value of `n-2`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range from 1 to `n` inclusive, so it will print the numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The first part of the output will be the string `'1 n-2'`, where `n-2` is the value of `n-2`.
   - The second part will be the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1 n-2 1 2 3 ... n (where n-2 is the value of n-2 and n is the value of n)**

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
