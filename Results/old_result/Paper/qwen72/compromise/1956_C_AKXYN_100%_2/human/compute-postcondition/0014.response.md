Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n-1`.

2. **Formatted String**:
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, the string will be `'2 %d' % (n-1)`, which results in `'2 n-1'`.

3. **Range**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, 5 + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Unpacking the Range**:
   - The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the sequence, so each element of the range will be printed as separate arguments to the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will first print the formatted string `'2 n-1'`.
- Then, it will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, the output will be:
  - `'2 4'` (since `i` is `n-1` which is 4)
  - Followed by the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the output will be:
  - `'2 n-1'` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n, and the sequence is the integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
