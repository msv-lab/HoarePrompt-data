Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be at least 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to `1` because the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `1` when `i` is `0`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `0`.
