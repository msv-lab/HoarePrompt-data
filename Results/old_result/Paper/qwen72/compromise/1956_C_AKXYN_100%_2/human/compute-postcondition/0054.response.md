Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500.
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 500, and it must be greater than 0.
- The list `mat` remains a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The variable `res` is now the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop.
