Let's break down the print statement and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`i` is `n-1`**:
   - This means `i` is the last index of the range from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **`'2 %d' % i`**:
   - The `%d` in the string is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - Therefore, the string will be formatted as `'2 n-1'` where `n-1` is the value of `i`.

3. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- The first part of the output will be the string `'2 n-1'` where `n-1` is the value of `i`.
- The second part will be the unpacked sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, then `i` will be 4.
- The string `'2 %d' % i` will be `'2 4'`.
- The unpacked sequence `*range(1, n + 1)` will be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### General Output:
- The string will be `'2 n-1'`.
- The sequence will be the integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **2 n-1 1 2 3 ... n (where n-1 is the value of i and the sequence is the integers from 1 to n)**
