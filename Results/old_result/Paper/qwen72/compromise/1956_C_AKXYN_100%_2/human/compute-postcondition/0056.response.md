The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts from `n` and decrements to 1. The initial state provided already ensures that `n` is greater than 0, but `i` is set to `n-1`, which means the loop will not execute as expected because the loop head requires `i` to start from `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to start from `n` instead of `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is `n`**
