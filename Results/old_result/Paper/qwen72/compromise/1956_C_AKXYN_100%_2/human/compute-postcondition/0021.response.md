Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, `i` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `mat` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `res` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After the loop has executed `n` times, `i` will be 0, which is the final state of `i` after all iterations are complete.
