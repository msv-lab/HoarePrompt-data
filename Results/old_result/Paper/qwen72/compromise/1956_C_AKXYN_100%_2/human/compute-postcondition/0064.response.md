Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `mat` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `res` is the sum of \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - `i` is \(n-2\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `'2 %d' % i`. This will format the string to include the value of `i` in place of `%d`.
   - `i` is defined as `n-2`. Therefore, the string will be formatted to `'2 (n-2)'`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each element separated by spaces.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `i` is `n-2`.
   - The range `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The string `'2 (n-2)'` where `(n-2)` is the value of `i`.
- Followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Combining these, the output will be:
Output: **2 (n-2) 1 2 3 ... n (where (n-2) is the value of `i` and `n` is the value of `n`)**

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**
