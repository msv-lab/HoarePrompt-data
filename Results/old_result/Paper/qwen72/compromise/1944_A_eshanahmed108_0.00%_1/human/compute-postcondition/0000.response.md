The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state of `func` being incomplete and the description of `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is a variable used in the loop, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
