The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function prints a result based on the following criteria: If the integer 0 does not appear in the list, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where the integer `j` appears fewer than 2 times in the list, or `n` if no such index exists. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
