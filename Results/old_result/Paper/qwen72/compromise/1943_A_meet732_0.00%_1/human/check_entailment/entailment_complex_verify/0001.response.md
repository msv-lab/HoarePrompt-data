### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` by removing it from `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then creates a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not in the array `a`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be 0, and the program prints 0.
   - This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and the smallest non-negative integer not in `c` is 0.

5. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
     - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally. Alice will include as many integers as possible, and Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest integers by removing them.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not in the array.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is correctly calculated.
   - The program correctly handles the case where some integers are missing from the array, ensuring that the MEX is the smallest missing integer.

### Validation with Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases internally.
  - Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`.

- **State after reading input and initializing `cntl`:**
  - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

- **State after the initial check for MEX 0:**
  - If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program prints 0 and moves to the next test case.
  - This is correct because if 0 is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and the MEX is 0.

- **State during the loop to find the optimal MEX:**
  - The program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
  - It iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
    - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it decreases `c` by 1.
    - If `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks the loop.
  - This logic is correct because it ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally, and the MEX is the smallest missing integer.

- **State after the loop:**
  - The loop has printed the output for each test case.
  - The program correctly handles all test cases and prints the correct MEX for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It accurately calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules and constraints.
