### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` by removing it from `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then creates a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not in the array `a`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be 0, and the program prints 0.

5. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
     - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not in the array.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It accurately calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
