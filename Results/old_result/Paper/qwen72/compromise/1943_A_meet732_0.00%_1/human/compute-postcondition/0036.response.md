Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the first element of `a` is not 0. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the first index in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `j` is `n` if no such index exists. `c` is 0 if the loop found two indices where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is 1 if the loop found one such index, or `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` if the loop did not find any such index.***
