Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 3 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the element at index `i` in `cntl` is 2, after the code is executed, the element at index `i` becomes 3. All other elements in `cntl` remain 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` are not changed by this code snippet.
