Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
   - The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.
   - The first element of `a` is not 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(0)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
   - The value `0` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, or `cntl`.

Output: **0**
