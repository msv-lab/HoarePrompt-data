Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` is 3, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is `c - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
