Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the first element of `a` is not 0. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the first index in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `j` is `n` if no such index exists. `c` is 0 if the loop found two indices where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is 1 if the loop found one such index, or `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` if the loop did not find any such index.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, `j` and `c` are not affected. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `n`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks, and the value of `j` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, `j` and `c` are not affected. Otherwise, `j` is `n`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` becomes 0 before `j` reaches `n`, the loop will exit and `j` will be the value at which `c` became 0. If `c` is still greater than 0 when `j` reaches `n`, the loop will exit and `j` will be `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
