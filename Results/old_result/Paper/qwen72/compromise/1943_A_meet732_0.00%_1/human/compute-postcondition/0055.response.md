Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` is 1, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.**
