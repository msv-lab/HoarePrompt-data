The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `3 <= n <= 18`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 9, `r` is 0, and `l` is 1. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 1.**
