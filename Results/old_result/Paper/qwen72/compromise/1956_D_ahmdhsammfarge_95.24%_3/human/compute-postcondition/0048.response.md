Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 5 to `n-1` plus 9, `r` is 2, `l` is 4, `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`.
- All other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `r`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The initial state conditions for `lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `r`, and `l` are still valid.
- The condition that `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop is now satisfied because `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.
