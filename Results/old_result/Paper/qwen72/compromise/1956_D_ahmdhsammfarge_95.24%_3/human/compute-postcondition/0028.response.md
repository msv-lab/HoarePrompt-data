Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 4, `r` is 0, and `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 2, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]`, `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 4 (since `(j - i + 1) ** 2` equals `(3 - 1 + 1) ** 2` which is 4).
- The values of `i`, `j`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition to update `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` is not affected by this code snippet, so `r` remains 0, and `l` remains the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found. `over_sum` remains unchanged unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.
