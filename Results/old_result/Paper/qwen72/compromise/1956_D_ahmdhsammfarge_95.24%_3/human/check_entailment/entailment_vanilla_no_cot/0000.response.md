Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function is supposed to find the optimal range \([l, r]\) for the operation to maximize the sum. However, the calculation of the potential new sum `sm` is incorrect. The expression `(j - i + 1) ** 2` does not represent the MEX of the subarray \([a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j]\). Instead, it calculates the square of the length of the subarray, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the update of the array elements.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function is supposed to recursively add operations to the list `ops`. However, it is not clear what the purpose of the recursive calls is. The function does not correctly determine the MEX or update the array elements.

3. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the subarray \([a_r, a_{r+1}, \ldots, a_l]\) and update the list of operations. However, it incorrectly appends the same operation multiple times and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.
   - The condition `if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:` is not necessary and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The function also does not correctly update the array elements to the MEX value of the subarray.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Calculate the MEX of the subarray \([a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r]\).
- Apply the operation to the subarray and update the array elements to the MEX value.
- Ensure that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

The provided functions do not meet these requirements, and thus the program is incorrect.
