### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - The formula used is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total number of points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the points that can be gained from wins. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score is not achievable with the given scores, and the program should print `-1`.
     - The expression `v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` gives the total points that can be attributed to draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (all scores are 0) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, such as `1 1 1` or `3 3 3`, by printing `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3, which is odd, so the program prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9, which is odd, so the program prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
