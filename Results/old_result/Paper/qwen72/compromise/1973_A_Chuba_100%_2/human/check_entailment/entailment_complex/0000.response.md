### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input, which are the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and the function prints `-1`.
   - This check is correct because in every game, the total points awarded (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw) must be even. Therefore, the sum of all scores must be even.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the maximum number of draws occurs when the points are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of 1-point games (draws).
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. If `v[2]` is greater than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` has more points than can be explained by the sum of the other two players' points, which is not possible without invalid games.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`, `3 3 3`) by printing `-1`.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function processes all test cases and prints the correct output for each one.
   - The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` are not stored or modified outside the loop, which is consistent with the problem description.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
