The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0. The variables `cards` and `k` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
