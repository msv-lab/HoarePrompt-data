### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - It then initializes two empty lists, `x` and `y`, to store the pairs of integers.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program uses a loop to read `t` pairs of integers. However, the loop is hardcoded to run 10 times, which is incorrect. It should run `t` times, not 10 times.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string by spaces and converts the first and second elements to integers, appending them to the lists `x` and `y`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program uses another loop to iterate through the pairs of integers.
   - It compares the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
   - The output format is correct, with a space separating the two integers.

### Issues:
- The loop that reads the test cases is hardcoded to run 10 times, which is incorrect. It should run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided in the input.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(t):  # Loop should run t times, not 10 times
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(t):  # Loop should run t times, not 10 times
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect due to the hardcoded loop that runs 10 times instead of `t` times.

Correctness: **False**
