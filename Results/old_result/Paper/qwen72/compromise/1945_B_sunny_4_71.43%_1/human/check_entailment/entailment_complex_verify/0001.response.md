Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.
   - Fireworks are launched at intervals `a` and `b` minutes, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes using the formula `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes using the formula `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
   - It prints the sum of `A` and `B`.

3. **Correctness of the Formulas**:
   - The formula `A = int(m / a) + 1` is intended to calculate the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes.
     - However, this formula is incorrect because it does not account for the visibility period correctly. It should be `A = int((m + 1) / a) + 1` to include the visibility period.
   - Similarly, the formula `B = int(m / b) + 1` should be `B = int((m + 1) / b) + 1`.

4. **Simultaneous Visibility**:
   - The program assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility period.
   - This assumption is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points in time where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We also need to consider the visibility period of each firework and how they overlap.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `6 7 4`, the program calculates `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1` and `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`, and prints `2`.
     - This is incorrect because the visibility period is `m + 1 = 5` minutes, and the correct calculation should be `A = int(5 / 6) + 1 = 1` and `B = int(5 / 7) + 1 = 1`, which still results in `2`.
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the program calculates `A = int(56 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B = int(56 / 8) + 1 = 8`, and prints `17`.
     - This is incorrect because the visibility period is `m + 1 = 57` minutes, and the correct calculation should be `A = int(57 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B = int(57 / 8) + 1 = 8`, which still results in `17`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility periods.
   - The formulas used to calculate `A` and `B` are incorrect and do not account for the visibility period correctly.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
