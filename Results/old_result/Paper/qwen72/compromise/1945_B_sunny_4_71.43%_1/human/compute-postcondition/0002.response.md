Output State: **The loop executes t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers a, b, and m from the input, calculates A and B as int(m / a) + 1 and int(m / b) + 1 respectively, and prints the sum A + B. After all iterations, the values of t, a, b, and m remain unchanged, but the values of A and B are not retained between iterations.**
