Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), and `k` (an integer). The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `1 <= k <= len(b) <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5`, and each element in `a` and `b` should be an integer in the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) as the first parameter.**
