Output State: **The `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18. The size of the generated `sequence` is returned as an integer. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0. `size` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `size`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions and the updated value of `size`.
