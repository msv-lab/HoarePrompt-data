The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers with a range of 0 to 10^9. 

Case_1: If the function is called under certain conditions not specified, it returns `None`.

Case_2: If the function is called with valid inputs, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, and returns the ceiling of the division of their sum by 3. If the function is called under unspecified conditions, it returns `None`.**
