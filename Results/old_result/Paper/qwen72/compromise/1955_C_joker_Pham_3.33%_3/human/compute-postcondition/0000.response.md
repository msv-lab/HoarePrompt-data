Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

The code initializes the variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n - 1` respectively. The initial state of `n`, `k`, and `a` remains unchanged.
