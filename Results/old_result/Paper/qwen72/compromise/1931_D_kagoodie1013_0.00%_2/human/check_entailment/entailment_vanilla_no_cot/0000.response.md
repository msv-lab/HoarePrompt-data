Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the number of beautiful pairs. The issue lies in how the program uses the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to count pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the sum and difference conditions can be checked independently and simultaneously using the same modulus operations. However, the conditions for a beautiful pair are:

1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should check both conditions for each pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)). The current implementation does not do this correctly. Instead, it tries to use the modulus of each element to count pairs, which does not account for the specific sum and difference conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) and checks both conditions explicitly, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
