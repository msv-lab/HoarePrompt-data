The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding list that, when one element is negated and taken modulo `x`, or taken modulo `y`, match the same remainder in the list. The function does not modify the input `test_cases` and the final state of the program includes the `results` list containing these counts for each tuple.
