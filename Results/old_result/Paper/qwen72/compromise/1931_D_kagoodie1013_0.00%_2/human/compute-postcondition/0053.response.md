Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by the sum of the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` (either 0, 1, or 2), `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `mod_x` is now equal to `-num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `-num % x` for the third element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- The value of `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- The value of `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
