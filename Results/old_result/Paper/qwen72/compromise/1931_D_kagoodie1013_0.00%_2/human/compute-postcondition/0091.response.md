Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated. `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` is the total sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for all elements in the corresponding `arr`. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that contain the frequency of each `num % x` and `num % y` for all elements in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple, but these dictionaries are not retained after each tuple's iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all iterations over the `test_cases` list.
- For each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, the loop has calculated a `count` value based on the frequency of remainders when the elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`.
- The `results` list now contains the `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`.
- The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries are used within each iteration to track the frequencies of remainders, but they are reset for each new tuple, so they do not retain any values from previous tuples.
