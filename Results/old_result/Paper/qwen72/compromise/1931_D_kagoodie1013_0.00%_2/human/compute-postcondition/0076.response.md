Output State: **`count` is now equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `count` is incremented by the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
- The values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are used to look up their corresponding values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, respectively.
- If `mod_x` is not a key in `mod_x_map`, it defaults to 0. Similarly, if `mod_y` is not a key in `mod_y_map`, it defaults to 0.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
