The only objects in the loop head are `test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple.
- `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` must have at least `n` elements.
- `num` is the last element of `arr`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.
- `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`.
- `mod_x_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears.
- `mod_y_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears.
- `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.
- `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`.
- `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples, as the first tuple has already been processed.
- `(n, x, y, arr)` will now be the second tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**
