Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is incremented by the sum of the values associated with `mod_x` and `mod_y` in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` (either 0, 1, or 2), `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mod_x_key = num % x` updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be the result of `num % x`, where `num` is the second element of `arr` and `x` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
