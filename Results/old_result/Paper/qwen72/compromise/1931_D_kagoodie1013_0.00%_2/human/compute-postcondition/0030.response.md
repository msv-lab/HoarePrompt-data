The code snippet `results.append(count)` adds the value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**
