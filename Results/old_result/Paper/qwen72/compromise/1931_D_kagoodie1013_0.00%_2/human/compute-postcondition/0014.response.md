Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with a value of 1, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with a value of 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_x = -num % x` updates the value of `mod_x` to be the result of `-num % x`.
- The value of `mod_x` was previously defined as `-num % x`, and the code snippet does not change this definition, so the value of `mod_x` remains `-num % x`.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
