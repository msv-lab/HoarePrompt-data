Output State: **`mod_x_key` is now equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`; `count` is now equal to the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)`, `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, and the previous value of `count`; `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples; `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` must have at least `n` elements; `num` is the third element of `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it; `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 2; `mod_x` is now equal to `-num % x` for the third element of `arr`; `mod_y` is now equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`; `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`; `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`.**
