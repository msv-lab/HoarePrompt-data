Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of `a` of length 3. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
