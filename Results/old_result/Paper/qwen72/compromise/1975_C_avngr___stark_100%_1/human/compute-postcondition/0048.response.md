The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` was already sorted in the initial state, this operation does not change the values in `temp`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` in ascending order, and `max` is the maximum value between the initial `max` and `temp[1]` if `temp[1]` > `max`. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.**
