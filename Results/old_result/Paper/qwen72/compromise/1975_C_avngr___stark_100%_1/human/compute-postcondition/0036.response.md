The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The list `temp` initially contains the first three elements of `a`. After sorting, `temp` will contain the same three elements but in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `max`, `_`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in ascending order.**
