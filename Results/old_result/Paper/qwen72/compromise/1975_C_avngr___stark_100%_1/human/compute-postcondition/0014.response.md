Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `temp` is a sorted list containing the first 3 elements of `a` if `n` is at least 3, otherwise `temp` is an empty list. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. If `temp[1]` is not greater than `max`, `max` remains 0.***
