The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
