Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`, `max` is updated to `temp[1]`.** 

The value of `max` is now the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which contains the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
