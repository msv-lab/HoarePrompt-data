The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `n - 2`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is 1 and `n - 2` must be greater than `i`).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in ascending order, `max` is the maximum value between the initial `max` and `temp[1]` if `temp[1]` > `max`.**
