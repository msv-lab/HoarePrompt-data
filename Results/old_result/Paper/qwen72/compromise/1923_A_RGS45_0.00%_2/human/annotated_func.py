#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). The list `a` must contain at least one chip (1). The function should be called in a loop or similar construct to process each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will process `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon represented by the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will be updated for each iteration, but their values will be determined by the input for each test case. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will be recalculated for each test case based on the input `arr`. After all iterations, the initial state of `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have printed the count of free cells for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `arr` of length `n` where each character is either '0' (free cell) or '1' (cell with a chip). For each test case, it prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the initial state of the input `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged, and the function has printed the count of free cells for each test case.
