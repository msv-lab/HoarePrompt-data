You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a set of cards, each with a number from 1 to n.
   - We can buy up to k new cards, and we want to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program sorts the array `a` which contains the counts of each card type.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array to find the point where the number of coins (k) is not sufficient to make all counts equal to the next higher count.
   - If the coins are insufficient, it calculates the maximum possible score by distributing the remaining coins as evenly as possible.
   - If the coins are sufficient to make all counts equal, it calculates the score based on the final counts.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count in the array `a`.
     - `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0.
   - **Iterate through the sorted array**:
     - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-2`, the program checks if the number of coins `k` is sufficient to make all counts from 0 to `i+1` equal to `a[i+1]`.
     - If `k` is insufficient, it calculates the maximum possible count `r` by distributing the remaining coins as evenly as possible and breaks the loop.
     - If `k` is sufficient, it subtracts the required coins and updates `r` to `a[i+1]`.
   - **Final Calculation**:
     - If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it calculates the final count `r` and the score.
     - If `k` is zero, it calculates the score based on the final counts and the remaining coins.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the distribution of coins to make the counts as equal as possible.
   - It correctly calculates the score based on the final counts and the remaining coins.
   - The program also handles the edge cases where `k` is zero or sufficient to make all counts equal.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Card Type**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly handles the case by simply adding `k` to the initial count.
   - **Insufficient Coins**: The program correctly identifies when the coins are insufficient and distributes them as evenly as possible.
   - **Sufficient Coins**: The program correctly calculates the score when the coins are sufficient to make all counts equal.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the algorithm to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
