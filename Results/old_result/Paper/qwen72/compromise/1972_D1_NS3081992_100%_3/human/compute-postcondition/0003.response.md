To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Condition 1: `i <= m`**
   - Since `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer, `i` is always less than or equal to `m` in the first iteration. This condition is satisfied.

3. **Condition 2: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - Substitute `i = 1` into the condition:
     - \( 1 * 1 \leq n + 1 \)
     - \( 1 \leq n + 1 \)
   - Simplify the inequality:
     - \( 0 \leq n \)
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (i.e., \( n \geq 1 \)), this condition is also satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Both conditions in the `while` loop head are satisfied with the given initial state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \), `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
