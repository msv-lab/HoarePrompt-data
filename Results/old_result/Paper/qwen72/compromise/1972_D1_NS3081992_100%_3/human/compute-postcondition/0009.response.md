Functionality: ** The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` for each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. This value is also stored in `rank[da - 1]`. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` remain unchanged except for the value stored in `rank[da - 1]`. The list `processing` is used to track processed elements but is reset to its original state by the function. **
