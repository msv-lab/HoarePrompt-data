Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0.**

The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, with `arr` still being a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and the length of the list.
