Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- `0 <= x, y <= 99`.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, only the constraints.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is less than or equal to 99.
   - Therefore, `1 <= x <= 99`.

2. **Expression `x / 15`**:
   - This expression divides `x` by 15.
   - Since `1 <= x <= 99`, the result of `x / 15` will be a floating-point number between `1/15` (approximately 0.067) and `99/15` (approximately 6.6).

3. **Function `math.ceil`**:
   - The `math.ceil` function rounds a floating-point number up to the nearest integer.
   - For `1 <= x <= 99`, the possible values of `x / 15` are between 0.067 and 6.6.
   - Applying `math.ceil` to these values will result in integers from 1 to 7.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be an integer between 1 and 7, depending on the specific value of `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the result is an integer between 1 and 7)**
