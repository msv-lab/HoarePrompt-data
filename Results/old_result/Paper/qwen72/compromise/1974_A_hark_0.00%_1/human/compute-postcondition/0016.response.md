Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and they are assigned the values from the input. If `x` > 0 and `y` > 0, `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`, and `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` remain unchanged.***
