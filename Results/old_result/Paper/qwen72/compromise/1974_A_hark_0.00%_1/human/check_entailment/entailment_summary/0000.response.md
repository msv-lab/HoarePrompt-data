### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not directly used in the main logic of the program. It simply returns the smaller of two values, but it is not called anywhere in the provided code. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons and adding the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - It prints the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - It prints the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - It prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times, which processes each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` is designed to handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- The formula used in `func_2` for calculating the number of screens is correct:
  - `math.ceil(y / 2)` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
  - The adjustment for 1x1 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) is intended to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
  - `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is used to ensure that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on additional screens, but this part of the formula seems to be incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the `+ 1` to avoid overestimating the number of screens needed.

### Correctness:
- The formula for calculating the number of screens for 1x1 icons is slightly off. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` instead of `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` to avoid adding an extra screen when it is not necessary.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the formula for calculating the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons is flawed. The `+ 1` in `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is unnecessary and can lead to an incorrect result.
