You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The function then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `x` after accounting for the 2x2 icons:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

This line attempts to adjust the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the number of 1x1 icons that could be placed on the screens occupied by 2x2 icons and then adding the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space left on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
1 1
```
- `x = 1` (1x1 icons)
- `y = 1` (2x2 icons)

The correct output should be `1` because:
- One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available on one screen.
- After placing the 2x2 icon, 11 cells remain.
- One 1x1 icon can easily fit into the remaining 11 cells.

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1` (one screen is needed for the 2x2 icon).
- `x = 1 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10` (which is incorrect).

Since `x` becomes negative, the program then calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1 = 0` (since `x` is negative).

Thus, the program prints:
```
1
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases.

### Another Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
12 4
```
- `x = 12` (1x1 icons)
- `y = 4` (2x2 icons)

The correct output should be `2` because:
- Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, and there are 15 cells available on one screen.
- After placing the 2x2 icons, 14 cells are occupied, leaving 1 cell on the first screen.
- The remaining 12 1x1 icons can fit into the 14 remaining cells on the second screen.

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (two screens are needed for the 2x2 icons).
- `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2` (which is incorrect).

Since `x` becomes negative, the program then calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1 = 0` (since `x` is negative).

Thus, the program prints:
```
2
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons correctly after placing the 2x2 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
