Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required for the applications. Specifically, the calculation of `x` after placing the 2x2 icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. 

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining space.
4. Calculate the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Let's correct the function `func_2`:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if y > 0:
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = (screens_for_2x2 * 15) - (y * 4)
        # Place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining space
        x -= min(x, remaining_space)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1)
    else:
        # If there are no 2x2 icons, only calculate for 1x1 icons
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

This corrected version should handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons correctly and output the minimal number of screens required.
