### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two teams (Red and Blue) with players, goals, a Quaffle, and a Bludger.
   - Players can move, catch, and throw the Quaffle.
   - The Bludger can eliminate players if they occupy the same cell.
   - Scoring occurs when a player leaves the Quaffle in the opponent's goal.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program should track the game's events and output the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an object (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction (`d`).
     - It correctly handles the four possible directions: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).
     - The function modifies the object's position in place, which is appropriate for the game's mechanics.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
     - It appends the eliminated players to a list `out` and then sorts this list to ensure the elimination events are printed in alphabetical order.
     - The function also sets the position of eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as out of the game.
     - It prints the elimination events with the current time `t`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Player Movement and Catching:**
     - The program correctly updates the position of the player and the Quaffle when a player moves.
     - When a player catches the Quaffle, the `carry` variable is set to the player's identifier, which is correct.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle:**
     - When a player throws the Quaffle, the `carry` variable is set to `None`, which is correct.
     - The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
     - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. It should increment the opponent's score instead.
   - **Bludger Movement and Elimination:**
     - The program correctly updates the position of the Bludger and checks for player eliminations.
     - Eliminated players are marked with `[-1, -1]` and their elimination events are printed correctly.
   - **Quaffle Reset:**
     - The program resets the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored, which is correct.
   - **Final Score:**
     - The program prints the final score at the end of the game, which is correct.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Scoring in Own Goal:**
     - The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. It should increment the opponent's score instead of the player's team score.
   - **Bludger Elimination:**
     - The `func_2` function is called twice in the main loop, which is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect behavior if the Bludger moves and then the player moves to the same cell in the same step.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While the provided functions are correct for their specific tasks (moving entities and handling eliminations), the program has a critical issue in handling scoring in the wrong goal.
   - The program also has an inefficiency in calling `func_2` twice in the main loop.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issue with scoring in the wrong goal and the inefficiency in calling `func_2` twice in the main loop. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
