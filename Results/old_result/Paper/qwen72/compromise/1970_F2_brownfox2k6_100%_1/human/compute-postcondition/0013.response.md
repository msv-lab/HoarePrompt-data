Postcondition: ***obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, and d is a string representing the direction of movement ('D', 'L', 'R', or any other value except 'U'). If d is 'D', the row coordinate of obj is incremented by 1. If d is 'L', the column value of obj is decreased by 1. If d is 'R', the column value of obj is increased by 1. If d is not 'D', 'L', or 'R', obj remains unchanged.***
