Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the input requirements:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where:
- **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.**
- **test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.**
