Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it only checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`) to determine the winner, which is insufficient to capture the game's rules and optimal play strategy.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
UUD
```

According to the program:
- The number of facing-up coins is 2, which is even.
- The program will output "NO", indicating that Bob wins.

However, if we simulate the game:
1. Alice chooses the first coin (U), removes it, and flips the adjacent coins (U to D and D to U). The string becomes "DUD".
2. Bob chooses the middle coin (U), removes it, and flips the adjacent coins (D to U and D to U). The string becomes "UU".
3. Alice chooses the first coin (U), removes it, and the second coin is not flipped (as it would be flipped twice). The string becomes "U".
4. Alice chooses the last coin (U), removes it, and the game ends with no coins left.
5. Bob has no coins to choose, so Alice wins.

The correct output for this case should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
