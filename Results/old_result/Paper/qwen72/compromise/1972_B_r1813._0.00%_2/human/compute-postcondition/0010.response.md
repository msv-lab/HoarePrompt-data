The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The string `s` represents the initial state of the coins, where each character in the string is either "U" (up) or "D" (down).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the minimum number of moves required to make all the coins face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of moves required to make all the coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction.**
