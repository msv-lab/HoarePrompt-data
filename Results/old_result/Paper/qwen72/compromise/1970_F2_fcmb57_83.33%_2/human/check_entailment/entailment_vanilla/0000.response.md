### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes the necessary dictionaries and variables.
   - It reads the field and populates the `players`, `goals`, and `quidditch` variables based on the input.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map direction characters to coordinate changes.
   - It correctly updates the position of the player based on the movement direction using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function is defined to handle the movement of entities by updating their coordinates.

3. **Collision Detection:**
   - The program checks for collisions between players and the Bludger. If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, the player is eliminated.
   - The elimination is correctly handled by printing the elimination event and updating the `quidditch` variable if the eliminated player was carrying the Quaffle.

4. **Catching the Quaffle:**
   - The program attempts to handle the catching of the Quaffle with the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`, but this is incorrect. The assignment should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to indicate that the player is now carrying the Quaffle.

5. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - The program correctly handles the throwing of the Quaffle by resetting the `quidditch[1]` to an empty string.
   - It checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - If the player scores in the wrong goal, the program correctly awards the point to the opposing team.

6. **Final Score:**
   - The program prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Issues:
- **Catching the Quaffle:**
  - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Parse the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        z = ''
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    z = k
            if z != '':
                del players[z]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected line
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Explanation of Correction:
- The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` was a comparison instead of an assignment. Changing it to `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` ensures that the player who catches the Quaffle is correctly recorded as carrying it.

### Final Correctness:
- **True** (after the correction)
