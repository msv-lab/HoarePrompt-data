The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be tuples of integers representing coordinates. However, the function incorrectly treats `a` and `b` as integers, leading to a `ValueError` when attempting to unpack them. As a result, the function never reaches the return statement and does not produce any output. The final state of the program is that a `ValueError` is raised due to the incorrect unpacking of `a` and `b`.
