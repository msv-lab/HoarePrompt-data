#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program raises a TypeError because `dx` and `dy` are not assigned any values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be tuples of integers representing coordinates. However, the function incorrectly treats `a` and `b` as integers, leading to a `ValueError` when attempting to unpack them. As a result, the function never reaches the return statement and does not produce any output. The final state of the program is that a `ValueError` is raised due to the incorrect unpacking of `a` and `b`.
