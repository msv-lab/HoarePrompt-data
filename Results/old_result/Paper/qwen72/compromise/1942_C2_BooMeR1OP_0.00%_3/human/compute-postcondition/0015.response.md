The function `max_triangles` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`.

- `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
- `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)).
- `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x).
- `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen and up to `y` additional vertices you can choose.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sides of the polygon), `x` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), `y` (the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose), and `chosen_vertices` (a list of vertices Bessie has chosen). It returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and up to `y` additional vertices.**
