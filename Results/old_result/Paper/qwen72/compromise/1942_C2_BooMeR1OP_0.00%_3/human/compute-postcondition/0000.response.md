The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input provided by `input().split()`, which splits the input string into three parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `chosen_vertices` is not affected by this code snippet and remains as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
