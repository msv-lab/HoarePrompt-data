You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then processes these inputs to calculate and print the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and up to `y` additional vertices. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input values `n`, `x`, and `y`, the sorted list `a` of chosen vertices (each element reduced by 1), the set `present` containing the elements of `a`, the list `gaps` of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list), and the calculated value `ans` which is the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen.
   - It then adjusts the vertices to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each vertex number and sorts the list `a`.
   - It initializes a set `present` to keep track of the vertices that are already chosen by Bessie.

2. **Initial Triangles Calculation:**
   - The program starts with `ans = x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the chosen vertices and checks if the next vertex (either `t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n` or `t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n`) can form additional triangles.
   - If `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because adding `t1` can form a new triangle with `a[i]` and `t2`.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. The gap is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, where `next_elem` is the next vertex in the sorted list, wrapping around if necessary.
   - It stores these gaps in a list `gaps` and sorts them.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted gaps and tries to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If `y` (the number of additional vertices you can choose) is greater than or equal to `pairs`, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by `pairs`.
   - If `y` is less than `pairs`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop, as no more vertices can be added.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The initial setup and input parsing are correct.
- The initial triangles calculation `ans = x - 2` is correct, as any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles.
- The check for additional triangles using `t1` and `t2` is correct, as it ensures that adding `t1` can form a new triangle with `a[i]` and `t2`.
- The calculation of gaps and the logic to maximize triangles by adding vertices is correct. It correctly handles the wrapping around of the polygon and the sorting of gaps to prioritize adding vertices to the largest gaps first.
- The final output is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
