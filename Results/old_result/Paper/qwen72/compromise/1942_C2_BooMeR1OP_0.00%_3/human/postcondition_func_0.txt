The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then processes these inputs to calculate and print the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and up to `y` additional vertices. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input values `n`, `x`, and `y`, the sorted list `a` of chosen vertices (each element reduced by 1), the set `present` containing the elements of `a`, the list `gaps` of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list), and the calculated value `ans` which is the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed.
