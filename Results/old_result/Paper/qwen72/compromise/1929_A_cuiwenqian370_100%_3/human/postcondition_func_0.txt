The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The input list `array` is modified to be sorted in ascending order, and the returned value is the 'beauty' of the array, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list.
