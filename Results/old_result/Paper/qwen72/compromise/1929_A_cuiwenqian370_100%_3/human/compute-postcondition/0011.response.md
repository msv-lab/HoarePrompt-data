Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to handle multiple test cases, and prints the results of applying `func_1` to each test case. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
