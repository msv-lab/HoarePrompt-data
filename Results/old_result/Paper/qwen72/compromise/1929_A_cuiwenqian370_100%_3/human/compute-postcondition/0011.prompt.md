You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 500), `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `array` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
