Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The other variables (`n`, `array`, and `data`) remain unchanged.
