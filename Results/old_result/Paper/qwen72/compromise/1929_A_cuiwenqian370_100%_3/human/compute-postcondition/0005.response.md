The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `array` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`
- `index` is 1
- `results` is an empty list

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state already specifies that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, so we need to ensure that `data[0]` is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
