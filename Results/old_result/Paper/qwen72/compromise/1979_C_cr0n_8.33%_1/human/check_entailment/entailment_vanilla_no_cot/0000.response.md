Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the bets for each outcome. The program computes the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. However, this approach does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). This value can become very large, especially when `n` is large, and it may not be necessary to use such a large value.

2. **Bets Calculation**: The program then calculates the bets as `prod // r` for each multiplier `r`. This ensures that the bet on the i-th outcome is `prod / k_i`, but it does not guarantee that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

3. **Denominator Check**: The program checks if `den = prod - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to zero. This is not the correct condition to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome, you can use a different approach. One effective method is to set the bets in such a way that the sum of the bets is just less than the smallest possible return value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers
    total_reciprocal = sum(1 / r for r in vals)
    
    # If the sum of the reciprocals is greater than or equal to 1, no solution exists
    if total_reciprocal >= 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Calculate the total amount of coins to bet
    total_bets = 1 / (1 - total_reciprocal)
    
    # Calculate the individual bets
    bets = [int(total_bets / r) for r in vals]
    
    # Ensure the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back
    for i in range(N):
        if sum(bets) * r <= r * bets[i]:
            bets[i] += 1
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reciprocal Sum**: The program calculates the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers. If this sum is greater than or equal to 1, it means that it is impossible to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Total Bets Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of coins to bet as `1 / (1 - total_reciprocal)`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is just less than the smallest possible return value.

3. **Individual Bets Calculation**: The program then calculates the individual bets as `total_bets / r` for each multiplier `r`.

4. **Adjustment**: The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. If not, it adjusts the bets by incrementing the bet on the i-th outcome until the condition is satisfied.

This approach ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem and outputs a valid solution if one exists.
