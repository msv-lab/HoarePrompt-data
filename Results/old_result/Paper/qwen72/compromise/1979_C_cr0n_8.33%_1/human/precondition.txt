The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, followed by a line containing n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should output the results to stdout, where for each test case, it outputs -1 if no solution exists, or n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on the outcomes, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
