Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is calculated as `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.
   - The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged (but they are not used in the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `prod`, `vprod`, and `den` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `den` is less than or equal to 0 is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
