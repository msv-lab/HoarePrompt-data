Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which is the point where the loop would terminate. The lists `output1` and `output2` will contain pairs of divisors of `x` such that each pair multiplies to `x`. Specifically, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`. If `x` is a perfect square, the square root of `x` will appear in both lists.
