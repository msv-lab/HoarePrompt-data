Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

The value `1` has been appended to the list `output1`, so `output1` now contains `[1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
