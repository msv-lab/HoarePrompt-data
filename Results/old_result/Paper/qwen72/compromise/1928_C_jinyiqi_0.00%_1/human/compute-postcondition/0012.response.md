The value `3` is appended to the list `output1`. The initial state specifies that `output1` is a list containing either `[1, 2, 3]`, `[1, 2]`, or `[2, 3]` depending on the conditions for `x`. After appending `3`, the possible values for `output1` are updated accordingly. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 1 and `x % 3 == 0`, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]`. If `x` is divisible by 1 but not divisible by 3, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]`. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing `[2, 3, 3]` and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]`.**
