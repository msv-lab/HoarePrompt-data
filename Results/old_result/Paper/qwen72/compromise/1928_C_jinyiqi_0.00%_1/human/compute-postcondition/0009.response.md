Output State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, if `x` is divisible by 1, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` and `output2` is a list containing `[x, int(x / 2)]`. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing `[2]` and `output2` is a list containing `[int(x / 2)]`.**
