You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'.
        #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and the current value of `k` is 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):

    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), `lk` remains unchanged.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))

    #State: *`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1). Otherwise, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and the new last element is `2 * k + 1`, and additional elements from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), `lk` remains unchanged.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that starts with the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline character, and then a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns '1\n2' in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns a string that starts with the length of a list `ans`, followed by a newline character, and then a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'.

Case_2: The program returns a string that starts with the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline character, and then a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
