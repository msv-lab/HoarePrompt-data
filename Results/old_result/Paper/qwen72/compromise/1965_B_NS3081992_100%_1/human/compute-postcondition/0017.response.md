Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the last element is `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, followed by `k + 1`, `lk` remains unchanged.**

The code snippet `ans.append(k + 1)` adds the value `k + 1` to the end of the list `ans`. The list `ans` initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. After appending `k + 1`, the list `ans` now includes all its previous elements plus the new element `k + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk`) remain unchanged.
