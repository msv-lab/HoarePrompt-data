Functionality: ** The function `func_14` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_7`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is greater than 1, `ans` contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and additional powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The function then returns a string that starts with the length of the list `ans`, followed by a newline character, and a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`. **
