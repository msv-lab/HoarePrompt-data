Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ..., 2^(l-1)]**. 

Note: The actual values in `ans` will depend on the length `l` of the binary string `b`. The loop appends powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\).
