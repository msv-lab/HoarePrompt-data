You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

It returns 1 if the length of the list `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each integer `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. The function ultimately returns this updated value. The `processing` list is used to track the processing state of each integer in the lists within `d`, but it is reset to its original state before the function returns. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, but `d` remains unchanged after the function concludes.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values obtained from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The first value in the returned tuple is `y`, the second value is `x - (a // b) * y`, and the third value is `g`.

Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_7()` to read the integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program handles it separately:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]` because the only valid subsequence is `[2]` and it does not sum to `k = 1`.
     - For other values of `n`, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k = 1`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For `k > 1`, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k - 1`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not equal `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k`.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in the required format.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Base Case:**
  - For `k = 1` and `n = 2`, the sequence `[2]` is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1.
  - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` (powers of 2) ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k = 1`.

- **Correctness of General Case:**
  - The sequence constructed for `k > 1` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
  - The sequence also ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k` by including `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` and the necessary powers of 2.

- **Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence size is at most 25, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
