Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input and returns this integer. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the integer has been read from standard input and is available as the return value of the function.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input (stdin) and returns an iterator of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the space-separated values into integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list of length `rows_number`, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a line from standard input as a byte string, removes any trailing whitespace from it, and returns the modified byte string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes the input from bytes to a string, which it then returns.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from the input string. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `rows`, which is a non-negative integer. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the list is the result of one call to `func_7()`. If `rows` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input, which is returned as the result of the function.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user input and returns this integer value. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value that was provided by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of strings derived from their input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing` initialized to 0, a positive integer `da` that is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to some default value. It returns 1 if the length of the list `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each integer `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. The function ultimately returns this updated value. The `processing` list is used to track the processing state of each integer in the lists within `d`, but it is reset to its original state before the function returns. The dictionary `d` and the list `rank` are modified, but `d` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the values obtained from the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`. The first value in the returned tuple is `y`, the second value is `x - (a // b) * y`, and the third value is `g`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_7`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is greater than 1, `ans` contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and additional powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The function then returns a string that starts with the length of the list `ans`, followed by a newline character, and a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value. It prints the result of `func_14()` a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`, each on a new line. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
