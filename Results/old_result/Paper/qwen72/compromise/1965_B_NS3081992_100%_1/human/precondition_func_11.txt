d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(da, max([max(sublist) for sublist in d.values()])) initialized to 0, da is a positive integer key present in d, and rank is a list of integers of length at least max(da, max([max(sublist) for sublist in d.values()])) initialized to some default value (e.g., 0).
