The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return a list of results for multiple test cases as described in the annotations. Instead, it reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list `a` of `N` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function returns the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where the count of `i` in `a` is 0 or where there are at least two unique integers in `a` that appear exactly once. If no such `i` is found within the range, it returns `N + 1`.
