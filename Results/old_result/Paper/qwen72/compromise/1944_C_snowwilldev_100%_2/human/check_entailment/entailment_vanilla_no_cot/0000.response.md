Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
   - The program iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each value.
   - If a value `i` appears exactly once, Alice can choose it to maximize the MEX, and Bob will not choose it to minimize the MEX.
   - The program returns the smallest value `i` for which either:
     - `cnt[i] == 0` (i.e., `i` is not in the array, making it the MEX).
     - `t >= 2` (i.e., there are two or more values that appear exactly once, meaning Alice and Bob can both choose one of these values, and the next value `i` will be the MEX).

This approach ensures that the final score is the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. The logic and implementation are correct and efficient, considering the constraints provided.
