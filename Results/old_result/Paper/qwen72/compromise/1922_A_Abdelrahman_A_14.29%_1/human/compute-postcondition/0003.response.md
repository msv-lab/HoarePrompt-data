Output State: **The variable `i` will have the value `tests - 1` after the loop finishes executing all iterations. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, otherwise it will be `True`.**
