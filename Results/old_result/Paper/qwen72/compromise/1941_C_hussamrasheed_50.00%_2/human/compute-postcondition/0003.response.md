The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts a single integer `t` as the first parameter, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function expects to receive an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `n` indicates the length of the string `s`, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
