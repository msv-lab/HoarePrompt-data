Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in a context where the first parameter is a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string `s`, and the next line contains the string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters to handle the input as described. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def make_beautiful(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s`. For example:

```python
test_cases = [(9, "mmapnapie"), (9, "azabazapi"), (8, "mappppie"), (18, "mapmapmapmapmapmap"), (1, "p"), (11, "pppiepieeee")]
make_beautiful(6, test_cases)
```
