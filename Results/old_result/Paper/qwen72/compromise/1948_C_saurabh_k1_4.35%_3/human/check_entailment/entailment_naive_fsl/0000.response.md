Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. This is insufficient because the robot's movement is influenced by both the arrows in the first row and the second row, and the program does not consider the full path the robot might take.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><>>
<<><
```
In this case, the robot starts at `(1, 1)`, moves to `(1, 2)` (because the arrow at `(1, 1)` points right), then moves to `(2, 2)` (because the arrow at `(1, 2)` points down), and then moves to `(2, 3)` (because the arrow at `(2, 2)` points right). Finally, the robot moves to `(2, 4)` (because the arrow at `(2, 3)` points right). The robot reaches the cell `(2, 4)`, so the correct output should be `YES`.

However, the program will output `No` because `b[n - 2]` (i.e., `b[2]`) is `<`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.
