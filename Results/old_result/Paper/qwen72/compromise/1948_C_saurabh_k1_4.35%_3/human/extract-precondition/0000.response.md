Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each string in the tuple consists of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2·10^5.**
