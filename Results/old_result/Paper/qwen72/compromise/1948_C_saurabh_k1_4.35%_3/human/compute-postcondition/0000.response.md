The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other states provided (t, n, and the list of tuples) are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
