The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is a list of even integers, each such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the lengths of the arrow strings. Each tuple in the list contains two strings of arrows, where each string consists of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to make the arrows in the first row point in the same direction as the arrows in the second row by rotating some of the arrows. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of even integers `n` representing the lengths of arrow strings, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether it is possible to align the arrows in the first row with those in the second row by rotating some arrows, with "Yes" for possible and "No" for not possible.**
