The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books, and then reads a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the number of pages in a book (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function then prints the sum of the maximum of the first `n-1` elements and the last element for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the user will have seen the printed results for each test case, and the variables `t` and the list of lists containing the test cases remain unchanged.
