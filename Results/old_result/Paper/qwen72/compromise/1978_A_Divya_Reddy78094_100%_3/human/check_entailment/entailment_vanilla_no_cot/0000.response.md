Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle the problem as specified. According to the problem, Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages in each pile, not the book with the highest index. The solution `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` assumes that the last book (with the highest index) is always in one of the piles and the book with the highest number of pages in the other pile is the second-to-last book. This is not always correct.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Sort the List**: Sort the list of pages in descending order.
2. **Sum the Top Two Pages**: The maximum number of pages Alice can read is the sum of the two largest numbers in the list, as these will be the books with the highest number of pages in each pile.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Example:
For the input:
```
5
2
1 1
4
2 3 3 1
5
2 2 3 2 2
2
10 3
3
1 2 3
```

The output will be:
```
2
6
5
13
5
```

This is the correct output because:
- In the first test case, the two largest numbers are 1 and 1, so the sum is 2.
- In the second test case, the two largest numbers are 3 and 3, so the sum is 6.
- In the third test case, the two largest numbers are 3 and 2, so the sum is 5.
- In the fourth test case, the two largest numbers are 10 and 3, so the sum is 13.
- In the fifth test case, the two largest numbers are 3 and 2, so the sum is 5.
