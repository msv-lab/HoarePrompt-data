Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of pages in each book for a test case. Each integer a_i in the inner lists should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each representing a set of books for a test case.
