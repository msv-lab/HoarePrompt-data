Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price. Therefore, the total cost for `n` yogurts is `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it means the promotional price is cheaper or equal to buying two yogurts at the regular price. Therefore, the total cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price. Therefore, the total cost for `n` yogurts is `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it means the promotional price is cheaper or equal to buying two yogurts at the regular price. Therefore, the total cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price).

The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions provided. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
