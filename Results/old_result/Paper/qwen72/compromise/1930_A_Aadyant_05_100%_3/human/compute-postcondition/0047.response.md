The code snippet `final.append(s)` adds the value of `s` to the list `final`. Given that `final` is initially 0, it is assumed to be an empty list (since 0 is not a valid list). After the execution, `final` will contain one element, which is the value of `s`. The value of `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least one word that can be converted to an integer, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is `len(list2) - 1` if `len(list2)` is odd, or `len(list2) - 2` if `len(list2)` is even, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the words in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**
