To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is converted to an integer and is greater than 0. Since `n` is currently a string representing user input, it needs to be adjusted to an integer for the loop to work correctly. Additionally, `num` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is a string representing user input.
- `final` is an empty list.

We need to adjust `n` to be an integer and ensure it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list**
