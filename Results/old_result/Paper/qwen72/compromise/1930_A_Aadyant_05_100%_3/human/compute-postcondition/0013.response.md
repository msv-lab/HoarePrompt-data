The only objects in the loop head are `str` and `list1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `list1`. If `list1` has at least one more word, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least two words, and `str` is the second word in `list1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `list1` must have at least three words, and `str` will be the third word in `list1`.

State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1` and the integer value of the second word in `list1`, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least three words, `str` is the third word in `list1`**
