### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The elements of the array must satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**
     - If \( k = n \), all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This is only possible if the array is constant (i.e., all elements are the same).
     - The program constructs an array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) (with \( n \) elements), which is correct.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, except for one element that is much larger than the others.
     - The program constructs an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n-1, n] \), which is correct.
   - **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
     - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is not possible to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. This is because if an array has more than one sorted cyclic shift, it implies that the array must have a repeating pattern or be constant, which would result in either all shifts being sorted or none being sorted.
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) in this case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program handles the special cases correctly:
     - For \( k = n \), it constructs an array with all elements equal to 1.
     - For \( k = 1 \), it constructs an array with elements in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For any other \( k \), it outputs \(-1\).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Case \( k = n \):**
     - The array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) is indeed sorted in all cyclic shifts.
   - **Case \( k = 1 \):**
     - The array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is sorted only in its original form.
   - **Case \( 1 < k < n \):**
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) because no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
