Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the third integer from user input, `s` is 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 + (2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The initial value of `s` is `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The new value of `s` is `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 + (2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
