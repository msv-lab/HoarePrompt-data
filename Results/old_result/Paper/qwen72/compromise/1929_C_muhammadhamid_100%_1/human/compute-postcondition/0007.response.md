The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be greater than `i`, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `x` is greater than 2, `s` is 1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 2**
