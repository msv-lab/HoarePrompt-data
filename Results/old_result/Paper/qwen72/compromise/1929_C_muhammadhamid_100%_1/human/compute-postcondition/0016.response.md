The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 1, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input**
