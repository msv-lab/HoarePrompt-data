The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `x` must be greater than 1, `s` is 1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)), `i` is 1**
