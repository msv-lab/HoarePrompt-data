Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + (2 + 2 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 2, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The initial value of `s` is `2 + 2 // (k - 1)`.
- After the update, `s` becomes `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + (2 + 2 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `_`, `k`, `a`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding user input and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain valid.
