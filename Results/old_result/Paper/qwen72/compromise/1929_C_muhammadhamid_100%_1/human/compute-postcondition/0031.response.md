Output State: **_ is 1, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the third integer from user input, `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 2`, `i` is `x - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `k` remains the first integer from the user input.
- The variable `x` remains the second integer from the user input, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `a` remains the third integer from the user input.
- The variable `s` starts at 2 and is updated by the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations.
- The variable `i` ends up being `x - 1` after the loop completes.
