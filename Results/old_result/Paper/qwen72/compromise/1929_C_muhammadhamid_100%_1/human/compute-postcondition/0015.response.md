Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 0, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input**

Explanation:
- The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `s`.
- Initially, `s` is 1.
- The expression `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` (which is 1) by `k - 1`.
- The result of `1 // (k - 1)` is 0 for any integer `k` greater than 1.
- Therefore, `s` is updated to `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2.
- The values of `_`, `k`, `a`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that the user input must be greater than `x` and that `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first, second, and third integers from user input, respectively, remains valid.
