The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
