You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and an integer `x` also less than \(2^{30}\). It iterates over the bits of the numbers in `a` and `x` from the 29th bit down to the 0th bit. Depending on the bit values, it either continues, returns `-1`, or updates a list `t` and a variable `ans`. The function ultimately returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`. `ans` represents the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making a bitwise operation result 0 during the loop. If certain conditions are met (e.g., `v` is 0 or odd), the function may return `-1` before completing the loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read different types of input. These functions are straightforward and correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - The function `func_5` is the core of the solution. It processes each test case.
   - **Initialization:**
     - `(n, x) = func_3()` reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x`.
     - `a = func_1()` reads the array `a`.
     - `t` is initialized as an empty list to store intermediate results.
     - `ans` is initialized to `-1` to handle the case where no valid `k` is found.
   - **Bitwise Processing:**
     - The loop `for i in range(29, -1, -1)` iterates over each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.
     - For each bit position `i`:
       - `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
       - `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
       - If both `u` and `v` are zero, the bit position is irrelevant and the loop continues.
       - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it means the `i`-th bit cannot be zero in the result, so the function returns `ans` immediately.
       - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, the function tries to partition the array such that the `i`-th bit is zero in each segment. This is done by iterating through the array and using bitwise XOR to track the current segment's contribution to the `i`-th bit.
       - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, the function continues to the next bit position.
       - If `u` is one and `v` is even, the function counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit is zero and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
       - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, the function breaks out of the loop.
   - **Final Result:**
     - The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR sums of the segments is less than or equal to `x`. The input handling and bitwise processing are correctly implemented to handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.
