Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic within the function `func_5` does not correctly compute the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

One potential issue is in the way the program handles the segments and the bitwise operations. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2
1 3 3 7
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

The program should output `-1` because there is no way to split the array `[1, 3, 3, 7]` into segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `2`. However, the provided program might not correctly handle this case and could output an incorrect result.

Another issue is that the program does not clearly handle the edge cases, such as when the array is empty or contains only one element. These edge cases need to be explicitly checked to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
