Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, and `i` is -1.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `x`**: These variables are updated to the values returned by `func_3()` at the start of the loop, and they remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`a`**: This list is modified during the loop. Depending on the conditions, elements may be added to or removed from `a` based on the XOR operations and bit manipulations.
- **`t`**: This list is used temporarily to store intermediate results during the loop. After each iteration, it is reset to an empty list.
- **`ans`**: This variable is updated to the maximum count of elements in `a` whose bits contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop. If no such elements exist, `ans` remains -1.
- **`i`**: The loop iterates from 29 down to 0, so after all iterations, `i` will be -1.
