Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 1, and the current value of `v` is odd. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
