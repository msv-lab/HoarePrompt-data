The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `val` is the first element in the list `a`.
2. `i` is an index (not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown).
3. `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
4. `val >> i & 1` extracts the least significant bit of the shifted value.
5. `op ^= val >> i & 1` toggles the least significant bit of `op` based on the extracted bit.

Since `op` is not defined in the initial state, its initial value is unknown. However, the operation modifies `op` based on the value of `val` and `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element, `val` is the first element in `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.**
