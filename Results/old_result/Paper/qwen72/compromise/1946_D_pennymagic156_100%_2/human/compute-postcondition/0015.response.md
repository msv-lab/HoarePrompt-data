The given code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ai` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer it's part of the list `a`) and `val`, and updates `ai` with the result.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)
- `val` is the first element of `a`
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Identify the affected variable**: The variable `ai` is affected. Since `ai` is not explicitly defined, we assume it refers to an element in the list `a`. Given the context, it likely refers to the first element of `a`, which is `val`.

2. **Perform the operation**: The operation `ai ^= val` means `ai` is updated to the result of `ai` XOR `val`. Since `ai` is the first element of `a` and `val` is also the first element of `a`, this operation effectively sets `ai` to 0 (since any number XORed with itself is 0).

3. **Update the state**:
   - `ai` (the first element of `a`) is now 0.
   - All other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `val` remains the first element of `a`, which is now 0.
   - `op` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, the first element of `a` is 0, `val` is 0, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`.**
