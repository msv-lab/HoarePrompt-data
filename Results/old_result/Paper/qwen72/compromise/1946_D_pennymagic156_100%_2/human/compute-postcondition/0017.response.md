The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. However, `ai` is not defined in the initial state, which suggests that `ai` should be an element from the list `a`. Since the first element of `a` is 0, and without further context, we can assume `ai` refers to the first element of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, with the first element being 0
- `val` is 0
- `op` is 0 (updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`)
- `t` is not mentioned, so we assume it is an empty list initially

After executing the code:
- `t` now contains the first element of `a`, which is 0
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is 0, `op` is 0, `t` is a list containing [0]**.
