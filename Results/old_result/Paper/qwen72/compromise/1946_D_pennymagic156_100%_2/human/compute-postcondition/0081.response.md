Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 3 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the third element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list that now includes the value `0` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- If the new value of `op` is 0, `t` is updated to include the value `0`, and `ai` is set to 0.
- If the new value of `op` is not 0, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain valid.
