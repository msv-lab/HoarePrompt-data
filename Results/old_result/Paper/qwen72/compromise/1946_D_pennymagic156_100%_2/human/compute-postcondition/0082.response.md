Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 3 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the third element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list that now includes the value `0` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged. `ai` is now `ai ^ val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`.
- All other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.
- The value of `ai` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its original value and `val`.
