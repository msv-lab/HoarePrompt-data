Output State: **`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `val` is the last element processed in the loop.**

Explanation:
- `op` and `ai` are both initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `val`) retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
