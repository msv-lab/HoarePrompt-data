The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` assigns new values to `n` and `x` based on the return values from the function `func_3()`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `x` after the assignment. However, we know that `n` and `x` will be updated to whatever values `func_3()` returns.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`.
- `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\).
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

After the code snippet is executed:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).**
