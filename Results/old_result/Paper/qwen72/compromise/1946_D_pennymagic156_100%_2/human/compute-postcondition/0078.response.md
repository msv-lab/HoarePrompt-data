Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `t` is a list that now includes the value `0`. `ai` is 0.** 

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. The first element of `a` is `a[0] ^ a[1]`, and `val` is the second element in `a`.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged.
- The variable `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- The list `t` now includes the value `0`.
- The variable `ai` is set to `0`.
