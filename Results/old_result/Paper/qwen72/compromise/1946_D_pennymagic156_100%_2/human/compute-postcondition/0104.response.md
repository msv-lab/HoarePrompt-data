The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of the expression `val >> i & 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` bits (which is 28) and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This extracts the 28th bit of `val`.
   - `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` by performing a bitwise XOR with the result of the above expression.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`.
   - All other variables (`u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 28 & 1)`**.
