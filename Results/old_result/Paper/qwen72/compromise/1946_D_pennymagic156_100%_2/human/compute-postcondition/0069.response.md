The code snippet `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ai` (which should be an element of the list `a`) and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. Since `val` is the first element in `a`, and assuming `ai` refers to an element in the list `a` (likely the same as `val` if `ai` is the first element), the effect is to toggle the bits in `ai` that match the corresponding bits in `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element.
- `val` is the first element in `a`.
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element.
- `val` is the first element in `a`.
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- The element `ai` in the list `a` (if `ai` is the first element, it is `val`) is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`.

If `ai` is indeed the first element of `a` (i.e., `ai` is `val`), then `val` will be unchanged because `val ^ val` equals 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element, `val` is the first element in `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`, and the element `ai` in the list `a` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`. If `ai` is the first element, it is now 0.**
