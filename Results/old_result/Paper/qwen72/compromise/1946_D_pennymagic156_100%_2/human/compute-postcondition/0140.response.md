Postcondition: ***`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list containing the first and third elements of `a`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, and `val` is the third element in the list `a`. If `op` is not 0, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition.***
