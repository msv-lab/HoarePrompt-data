The code snippet `ai ^= val` modifies the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. Here, `ai` refers to the first element of the list `a` (since `a[0]` is often referred to as `ai` in such contexts). The value of `val` is the second element of the list `a`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements.
- `val` is the second element in `a`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

The code `ai ^= val` updates the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.**
