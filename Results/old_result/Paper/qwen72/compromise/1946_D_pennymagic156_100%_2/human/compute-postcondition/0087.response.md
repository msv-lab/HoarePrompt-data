Output State: **`a` is now an empty list, `t` is the list that previously contained `0` if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise `t` is an empty list. `op` is the XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the original `a`. `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`. `i` remains 28. `val` is the last element processed in the loop.**
