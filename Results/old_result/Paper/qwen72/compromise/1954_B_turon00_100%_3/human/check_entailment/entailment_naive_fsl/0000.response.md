Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same element but can still be made beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```

The array is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` and replace `a[2]` with `a[1]` to get `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1` because removing any single element will still leave the array beautiful. The program fails to correctly identify this edge case.
