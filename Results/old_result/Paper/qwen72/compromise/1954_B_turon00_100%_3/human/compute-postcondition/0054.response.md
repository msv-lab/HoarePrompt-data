Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` found during the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a` and is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is the input list and is not modified within the loop.
- **`tmp`**: Remains equal to `a[0]` because it is only set once before the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`cnt`**: This variable counts the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list. If the last element is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end. If the last element is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` found during the loop. If there are no consecutive elements equal to `tmp` in the entire list, `ans` will be 0. Otherwise, `ans` will be the smallest count of such consecutive elements.
