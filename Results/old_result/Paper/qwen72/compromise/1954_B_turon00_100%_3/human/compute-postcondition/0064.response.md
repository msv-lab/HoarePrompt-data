Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `a[0]` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, if `n` is not 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, no further changes are made.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. This update does not affect the other variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being the specific value of `tmp` which is now explicitly stated to be `a[0]`.
