Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 0, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times, and `t` was initially a positive integer. The loop variable `_` will have been used to iterate through the range `t`. For each test case, the variables `n` and `a` will have been updated with the input values for that test case, and the variables `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated according to the logic of the loop. Specifically, `tmp` will be the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output will be `-1`. Otherwise, the output will be `ans`. The state of `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be the final state for the last test case processed by the loop.
