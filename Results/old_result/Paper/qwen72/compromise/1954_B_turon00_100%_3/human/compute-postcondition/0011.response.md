Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in the list `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Since `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is initially equal to `n`, the code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` will update `ans` to be the minimum of `n` and 0. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` will be updated to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
