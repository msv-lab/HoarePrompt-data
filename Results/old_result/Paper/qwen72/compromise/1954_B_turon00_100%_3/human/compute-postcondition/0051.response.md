Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1 or 2 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- If `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is initially `n`. Therefore, `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, which is `cnt` since `cnt` is either 1 or 2 and `n` is greater than 2.
- If `a[1]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is initially 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`) retain their initial values.
