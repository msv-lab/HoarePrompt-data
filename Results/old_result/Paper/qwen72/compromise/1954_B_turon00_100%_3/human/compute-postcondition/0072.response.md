Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` reassigns the value of `cnt` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `cnt` remains 0. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`) are not affected by this code and retain their initial values.
