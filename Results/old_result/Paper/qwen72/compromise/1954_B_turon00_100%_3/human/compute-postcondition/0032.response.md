Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` and is updated to the smaller value between the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the postcondition remains as described. If `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the postcondition also remains as described.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an input integer, and the rest of the initial state remains valid.
