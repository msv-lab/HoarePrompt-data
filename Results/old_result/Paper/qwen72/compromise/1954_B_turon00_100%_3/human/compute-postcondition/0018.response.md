Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`.**
