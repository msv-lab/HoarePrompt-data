The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This already ensures that `t` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop**
