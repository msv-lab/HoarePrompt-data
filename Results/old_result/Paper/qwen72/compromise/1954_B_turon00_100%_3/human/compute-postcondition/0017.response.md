Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` reassigns the value of `cnt` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged.
