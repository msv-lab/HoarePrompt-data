Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt`, with the addition that `ans` is now equal to `n`.
