Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
