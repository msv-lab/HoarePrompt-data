You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. The loop has printed 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`, or 'YES' followed by 2 and the values of `n - k + 1` and 1 if `n + 2 > k * 2`, or 'NO' if neither condition is met, for each of the `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (where \(1 \le t \le 1000\)) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where \(1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}\)). The function then prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`, or 'YES' followed by 2 and the values of `n - k + 1` and 1 if `n + 2 > k * 2`, or 'NO' if neither condition is met. After processing all test cases, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide a valid configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks three conditions:
     1. **If `n == k`:**
        - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy one jewel from a single stall priced at 1 coin.
        - This is a valid configuration, so the program prints "YES", followed by 1 and 1.
     2. **If `n + 2 > k * 2`:**
        - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
        - This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin.
        - This is a valid configuration because Alice will buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
     3. **Otherwise:**
        - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NO".
        - This implies that it is impossible to set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1 (`n == k`):**
     - This is a straightforward case where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin.
     - This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2 (`n + 2 > k * 2`):**
     - This condition ensures that Alice has enough coins to buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin.
     - The condition `n > 2 * k - 2` is derived from the requirement that Alice must have at least `k-1` coins left after buying `k-1` jewels from the first stall.
     - This condition is also correct.
   - **Condition 3 (else):**
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels in any valid configuration.
     - This condition is correct.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices when the conditions are met.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" when the conditions are not met.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the conditions it checks.

Correctness: **True**
