Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, `res` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]` and the final value of `ans`. Additionally, `k` is not 0.**
