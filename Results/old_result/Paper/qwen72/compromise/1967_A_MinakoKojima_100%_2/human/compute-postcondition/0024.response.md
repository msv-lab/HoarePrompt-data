Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)` and `ans` is set to the first element of `a` plus `dif`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is set to 0 and `ans` is set to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
