Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `i` is 1. If `dif` (which is `a[2] - a[1]`) is not 0, `ans` is either the second element of `a` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, or `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` if `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, and `k` is set to 0. If `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. If `k` is not 0, `k` is updated to `k - dif` and `res` is `n - 2 + k % 2`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 1` and `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, with `k` set to 0.***
