Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 1, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, and `k` is 0, `ans` remains `a[0]`, `res` remains `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is not 0, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is set to `a[1]`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`. If `dif` is 0, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is 0, and `res` is `n - 2`.**
