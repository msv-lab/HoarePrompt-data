Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case, `a` is the last element in `ans_list`, `ans_list` must have exactly `t` elements.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `_` is still `t - 1`.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain the input integers they were initially.
- The variable `a` is the sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- The variable `i` is still `n - 2`.
- The variable `ans` has been updated to its final value after all iterations, which is calculated as `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.
- The variable `res` has been updated to `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise it remains the final value after all iterations.
- The variable `k` is either 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration.
- The list `ans_list` contains exactly `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case.
- The variable `a` in the loop is the last element in `ans_list` when the loop finishes executing.
