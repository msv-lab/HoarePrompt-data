Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, and `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is set to `a[1]`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `ans` remains `a[0]`, and `res` remains `n - 1`. In both cases, the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not 0, and we may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
