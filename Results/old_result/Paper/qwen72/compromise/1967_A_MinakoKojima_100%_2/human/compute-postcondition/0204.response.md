Output State: **_ is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is increased by `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `ans_list` now contains `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain as the input integers.
- The value of `a` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2`.
- The value of `ans` remains `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.
- The value of `res` is increased by `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
- `ans_list` now contains the value of `ans`.
