Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.***
