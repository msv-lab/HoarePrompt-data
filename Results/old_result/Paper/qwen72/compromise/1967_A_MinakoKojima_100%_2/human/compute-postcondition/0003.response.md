The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts (based on spaces), converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers, and `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, where `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.
- `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
