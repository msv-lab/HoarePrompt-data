The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted, but its specific values depend on the initial input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.**
