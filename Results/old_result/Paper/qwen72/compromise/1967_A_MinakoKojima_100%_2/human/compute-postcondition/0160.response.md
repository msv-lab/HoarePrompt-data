Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` with `dif` not being 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is the second element of `a`, `k` is updated to `k - dif`, and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `res` remaining `n - 1`.**
