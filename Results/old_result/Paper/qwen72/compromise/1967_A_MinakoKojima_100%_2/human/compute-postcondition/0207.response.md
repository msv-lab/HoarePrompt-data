Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `_` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus \((ans - 1) \times (n - 1) + res\).
   - `res` is the final value after all iterations plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations.
   - `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration.
   - `ans_list` contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case.
   - `a` is the first element in `ans_list`.
   - `ans_list` must have at least 1 element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `a` is the first element in `ans_list`.
   - `ans_list` contains `t` elements, where each element is the value of `ans` for each test case.
   - Since `t` is at least 1, `ans_list` will always have at least one element.
   - The value of `a` is the value of `ans` for the first test case.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `ans` for the first test case.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `ans` for the first test case.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of ans for the first test case)**
