Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `dif` is equal to `a[2] - a[1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `dif` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 2 + k % 2`. If `i` is not 0 and `dif` is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1 + k % 2`. If `i` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 1` if `dif` is not 0, and `n - 2` if `dif` is 0.***
