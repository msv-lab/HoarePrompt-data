Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2, and `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`. If `i` is not 0, the following conditions apply: If `dif` (which is `a[3] - a[2]`) is 0, `res` is `n - 3 + k % 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `k` remains 0, `res` is `n - 2 + k % 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than 0, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * 2`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * 2`, `ans` is set to `a[1] + dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 4 + k % 3`. If `k` is less than `dif * 2`, `k` is set to 0, `res` is `n - 2 + k % 3`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. In all cases, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3`. If `i` is 0, the program state remains unchanged.***
