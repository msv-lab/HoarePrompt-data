Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `dif` is equal to `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is equal to `n - 2` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is equal to `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is decremented by 1.
- If `dif` is 0, `res` was initially `n - 2`, so after decrementing, `res` is `n - 3`.
- If `dif` is not 0, `res` was initially `n - 1`, so after decrementing, `res` is `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, `dif`) remain unchanged.
