Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is 0, `ans` is either `a[1] + dif` or `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `k` is either `k - dif * (i + 1)` or 0, and `res` is either `n - 1` if `dif` is 0 or `n - 2 + k % 2` if `k` is 0 or `k - dif`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
