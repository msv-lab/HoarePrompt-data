Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cards_left(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards.**
