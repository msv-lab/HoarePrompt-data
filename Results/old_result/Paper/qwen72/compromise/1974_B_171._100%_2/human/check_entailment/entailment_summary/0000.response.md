Reasoning:  
The provided program follows the described decoding algorithm accurately. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string and the encoded string `b`.
3. **Decoding Function**: The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string:
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` works as intended, creating a reverse mapping of characters and applying it to the encoded string to produce the decoded string.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly decodes the string according to the specified algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
