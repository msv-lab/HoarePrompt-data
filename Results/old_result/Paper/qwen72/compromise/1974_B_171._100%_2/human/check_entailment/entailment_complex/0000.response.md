Reasoning:  
The program is intended to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The key steps in the decoding process are:

1. **Extracting Unique Characters**: The program first extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order. This step correctly identifies the characters that were used in the original string and prepares them for the decoding process.

2. **Creating the Reverse Mapping**: A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart. For example, if the unique characters are "abc", then 'a' maps to 'c', 'b' maps to 'b', and 'c' maps to 'a'. This step is crucial for reversing the encoding process.

3. **Decoding the String**: The program then iterates over each character in the encoded string and replaces it with its corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary. This step correctly reverses the encoding process by applying the reverse mapping.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually, storing the results in a list and printing them at the end. This is a standard approach for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.

The program's logic and flow are consistent with the problem description, and the steps taken to decode the string are correct. The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified.

Correctness: **True**
