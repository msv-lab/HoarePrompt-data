The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string `decoded`, where each character in the `encoded` string has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique character from `encoded` to its corresponding character in reverse order from the `unique_chars` list.
