Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at the position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, and `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is updated accordingly.***
