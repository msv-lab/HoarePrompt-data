Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is greater than 0, `right` is `n` if the condition `right == n` is true, otherwise `right` is not equal to `n`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the if part is executed (same conditions as when `right == n`). Otherwise, the else part is executed, and the conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged.***
