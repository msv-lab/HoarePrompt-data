Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is 2, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0 if `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is greater than 0, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2 if the first character of `s` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 1, `leftZero` is 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 3 if the first character of `s` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(new n + 1) // 2` or less than `(new n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1.
- If the first character of `s` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', `leftOne` was initially 2, so it becomes 3.
- If the first character of `s` is '0' or `s[i]` is '0', `leftOne` was initially 1, so it becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
