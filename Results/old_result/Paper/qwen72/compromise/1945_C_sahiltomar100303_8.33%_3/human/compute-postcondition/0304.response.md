The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Let's break down the impact on the program:

- `rightZero` is incremented by 1.
- The previous value of `rightZero` was either 0 or 1 depending on the character at index `i` in `s`.
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` was 1 and is now 2.
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then `rightZero` was 0 and is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `leftMove`, `left`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0 if `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is greater than 0, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `trightZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 2, and `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(new n + 1) // 2` or less than `(new n + 1) // 2`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 1, and `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(new n + 1) // 2 + 1` or less than `(new n + 1) // 2 + 1`.**
