Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should also handle an input integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, and if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is greater than 0, then `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` or `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If `left == 0`, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, and `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left > 0`, `left` is greater than 0, `right` is `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to `n`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right == n` and `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` are as described in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, and the loop condition `leftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` is no longer true. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n` and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, if `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program follows the else part conditions. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, then if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the program follows the if part conditions. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the program follows the else part conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
