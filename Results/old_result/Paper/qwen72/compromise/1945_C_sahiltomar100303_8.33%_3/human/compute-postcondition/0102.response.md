Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 3) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 - 1) // 2.**

The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
