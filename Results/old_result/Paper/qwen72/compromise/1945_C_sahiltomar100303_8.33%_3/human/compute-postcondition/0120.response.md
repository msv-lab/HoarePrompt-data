Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `right` is initialized to `n`.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is equal to `n`.

Since `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0, the value of `right` will be the same as `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
