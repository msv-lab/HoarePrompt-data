Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the string `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.** 

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
