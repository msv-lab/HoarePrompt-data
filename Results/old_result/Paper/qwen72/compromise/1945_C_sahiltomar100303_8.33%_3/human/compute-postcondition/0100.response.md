Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` is equal to `tleftZero + 1`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 - 1) // 2 or `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 3) // 2`**

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
