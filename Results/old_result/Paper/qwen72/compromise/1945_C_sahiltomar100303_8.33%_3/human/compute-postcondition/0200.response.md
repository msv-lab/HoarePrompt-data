Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2` if `leftZero` is not less than `((n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is decremented by 1, `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and the value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
