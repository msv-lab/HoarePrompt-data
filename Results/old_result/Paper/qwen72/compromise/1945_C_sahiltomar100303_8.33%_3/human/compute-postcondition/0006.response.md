Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `rightZero` to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of `rightZero` being 0.
