Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0 if `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is greater than 0, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(new n + 1) // 2` or less than `(new n + 1) // 2` if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(new n + 1) // 2 + 1` or less than `(new n + 1) // 2 + 1`.**
