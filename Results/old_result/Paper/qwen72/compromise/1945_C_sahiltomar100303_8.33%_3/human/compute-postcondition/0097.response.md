Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 1`, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged. If `s[right]` is '0', `rightZero` is decreased by 1 and `tleftZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1. `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2) // 2`.***
