Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road should be laid at position 0 or position n. For example, consider the input where all residents want to live on the left side of the street (i.e., the string is all '0's). The program should output 0 (indicating the road should be laid before the first house), but it does not handle this case correctly. Similarly, if all residents want to live on the right side of the street (i.e., the string is all '1's), the program should output n-1 (indicating the road should be laid after the last house), but it does not handle this case correctly either. 

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
3
000

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output:
3
```

In this case, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 0, as all residents want to live on the left side, and the road should be laid before the first house to satisfy the condition.
