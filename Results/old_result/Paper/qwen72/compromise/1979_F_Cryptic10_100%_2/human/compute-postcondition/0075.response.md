Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and the new `v1` from the previous iteration, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the second element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the last tuple in the original `ops` list, and if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` is updated to include `v1` at the end; if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` is updated to include `v1` at the end.**
