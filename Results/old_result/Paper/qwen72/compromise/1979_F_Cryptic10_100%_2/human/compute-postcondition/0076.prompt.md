Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` for each such iteration. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` for each such iteration. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the first element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the first elements of the reversed `ops` list, `p1` or `p2` has been appended with `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the second element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, `p1` or `p2` has been appended with the new `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and the new `v1` from the previous iteration, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing the second element of the reversed `ops` list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the last tuple in the original `ops` list, and if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` is updated to include `v1` at the end; if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` is updated to include `v1` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
