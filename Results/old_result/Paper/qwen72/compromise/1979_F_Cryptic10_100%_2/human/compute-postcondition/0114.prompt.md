Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations. `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations, `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop that must have at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list that may contain one element if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations, `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop that must have at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list that may contain one element if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second-to-last tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`; if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations, `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop that must have at least three tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list that may contain one element if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the third-to-last tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1` and `v1` is appended to `p1`; if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains the two integers from `vx` plus `v1` and `v1` is appended to `p2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
