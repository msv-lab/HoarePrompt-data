Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is `len(vx) - 2`, `v2` is `0`.**

Explanation:
- `vx` remains a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` remains an empty list.
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 2.
- `p1` remains a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` remains an empty list because `ops` is still empty.
- `v1` is assigned the value `len(vx) - 2`, which is the number of elements in `vx` minus 2.
- `v2` is assigned the value `0`.
