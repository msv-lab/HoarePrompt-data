Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1` and `v2`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. `ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx` and `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` is removed from `vx`. The tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to the list `ops`.**
