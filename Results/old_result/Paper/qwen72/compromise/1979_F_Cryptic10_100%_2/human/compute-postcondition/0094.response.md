Output State: **`v3` is assigned the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and the second value returned by `q` is ignored. The initial state of `vx`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: `v3` is now the first value returned by the function `q` when it is called with the argument `0`. The second value returned by `q` is ignored. All other variables (`vx`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2`) remain in their initial states.
