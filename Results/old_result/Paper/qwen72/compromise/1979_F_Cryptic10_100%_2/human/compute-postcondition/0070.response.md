To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` from the `ops` list. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so for the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration.
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

We need to ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple. The state of `vx`, `p1`, and `p2` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `ops` must be such that it contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute.

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `v1` and `v2` are the first elements of the reversed `ops` list**.
