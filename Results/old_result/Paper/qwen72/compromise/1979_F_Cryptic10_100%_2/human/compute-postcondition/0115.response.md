To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations.
2. `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop.
3. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, plus any integers from `ops` that were appended to `p1` because `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the time of the operation.
4. `p2` is a list containing any integers from `ops` that were appended to `p2` because `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the time of the operation.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`.
2. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This concatenates the reversed `p1` list with the `p2` list.
3. **`map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)`**: This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
4. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This joins the string representations of the elements with a space.
5. **`'! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This formats the string to start with an exclamation mark followed by the joined string of elements.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`p1`**: Contains the two integers from `vx` and any additional integers from `ops` that were appended because `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`.
- **`p2`**: Contains any integers from `ops` that were appended because `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string that starts with an exclamation mark, followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order, and then the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

Output: **! [elements of p1 in reverse order] [elements of p2] (where the elements of p1 and p2 are the integers described in the initial state)**

For example, if `p1` is `[3, 5, 7]` and `p2` is `[2, 4]`, the output would be:
Output: **! 7 5 3 2 4**
