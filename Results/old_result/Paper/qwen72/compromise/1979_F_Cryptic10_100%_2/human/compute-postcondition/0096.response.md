Output State: **`v3` is removed from `vx`, `v3` is assigned the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and the second value returned by `q` is ignored. `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end of its current list. The initial state of `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remains unchanged.**
