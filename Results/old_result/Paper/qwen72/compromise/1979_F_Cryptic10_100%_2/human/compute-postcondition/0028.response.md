Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` removed, `len(vx) > 1`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, `ops` is a list that includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**
