Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2` and `v3`. `ops` is a list containing tuples, and it has been updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is that `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2` and `v3`.
- `ops` is a list containing tuples, and it has been updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` at the end.
- `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` remains an empty list.
- `v1` is now `len(vx) - 2`.
- `v2` is now the second value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.
- `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.
