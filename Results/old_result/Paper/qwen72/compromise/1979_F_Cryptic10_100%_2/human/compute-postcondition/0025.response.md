Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed, `len(vx) > 1`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, where `len(vx) - 1` is the number of elements in `vx` minus 1, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`.** 

The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
