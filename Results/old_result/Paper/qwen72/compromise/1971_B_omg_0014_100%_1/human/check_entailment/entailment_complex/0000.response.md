### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - The function creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and it is impossible to rearrange `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. In this case, the function prints "NO".

3. **Generating a New String:**
   - If the string `s` has more than one unique character, the function prints "YES".
   - It then sorts the string `s` in ascending order to form `b` and in descending order to form `c`.
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string `c` (which is guaranteed to be different from `s`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b` (which is also guaranteed to be different from `s`).

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified in the problem statement.
   - It ensures that the output string `r` is different from the input string `s` by using the sorted versions of `s`.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly identifies when it is impossible to rearrange the string (i.e., when all characters are the same).
- It correctly generates a new string `r` that is different from `s` by using sorted versions of `s`.
- The logic ensures that the output string `r` is always different from `s` when possible, and the output format is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
