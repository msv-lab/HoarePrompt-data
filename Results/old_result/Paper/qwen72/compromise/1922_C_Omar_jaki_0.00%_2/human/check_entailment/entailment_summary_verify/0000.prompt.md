You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20

    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4

    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        print(b, 'B')
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of city positions and a series of queries. It calculates and prints the cumulative sums of differences between city positions based on specific conditions. For each query, it prints the difference in these cumulative sums between two specified city indices. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input variables `t`, `u`, `c`, and `d` as 0 (falsy values), and `b` as a list containing the cumulative sums of the differences. The original lists `a` and `queries` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs**:
   - The program calculates the cost to travel to the closest city using the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`. This is incorrect because the cost to travel to the closest city should always be 1 coin, regardless of the distance. The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` can result in values other than 1, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The program uses a list `b` to store cumulative costs, but the way it is constructed and used is not clear and seems to be incorrect. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between two cities is flawed. Specifically, the subtraction `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` and `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to travel between the cities.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the cities are very close together or when the cities are far apart. The logic for determining the closest city and the cost to travel to it is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```
The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```
However, the program's logic for calculating the costs is incorrect, and it will likely produce different results. Specifically, the way it calculates the cumulative costs and the way it handles the queries is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
