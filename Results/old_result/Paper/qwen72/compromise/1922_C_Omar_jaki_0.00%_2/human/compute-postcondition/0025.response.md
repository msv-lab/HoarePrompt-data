To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: A non-zero integer decreased by 1.
2. **`n`**: An integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **`a`**: A list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\).
4. **`m`**: An integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
5. **`queries`**: A list of \(m\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\).
6. **`b`**: A list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
7. **`u`**: The value returned by `r()` minus 1 and is assumed to be truthy.
8. **`c` and `d`**: Values returned by `r()`, with `c` being greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is a list where the last two elements are the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
   - Let's denote these last two elements as `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.

2. **Understanding `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are indices into the list `b`, and `b` has the last two elements as the cumulative sums, the indices must refer to these last two elements.

4. **Possible Values**:
   - If `c` and `d` are such that `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` point to the last two elements of `b`, then:
     - `b[c * 2 - 1]` will be `b[-1]`.
     - `b[d * 2 - 1]` will be `b[-2]`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be `b[-1] - b[-2]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the last two elements of the list `b`.

Output: **b[-1] - b[-2] (where b[-1] and b[-2] are the last two elements of the list b)**
