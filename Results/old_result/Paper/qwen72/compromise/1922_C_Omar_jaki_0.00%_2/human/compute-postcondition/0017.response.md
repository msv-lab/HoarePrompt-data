To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
   - `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
   - `queries` is a list of `m` pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.
   - `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.

2. **Understanding `b`:**
   - The list `b` is described as having the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
   - This means `b` is a list where the last two elements are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(b, 'B')` statement will print the list `b` followed by the string 'B'.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since the exact values of `a` and the specific conditions for the cumulative sums are not provided, we can only describe the structure of `b` based on the given information.
   - The list `b` will have the last two elements as the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.

Given this information, the output will be:

Output: **[b_1, b_2, ..., b_(n-2), cumulative_sum_1, cumulative_sum_2] B (where b_1, b_2, ..., b_(n-2) are the elements of b before the last two elements, and cumulative_sum_1 and cumulative_sum_2 are the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in a that satisfy certain conditions)**
