To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: This list has its original length.
2. **`b`**: This list has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements. Each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows:
   - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
   - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.
3. **`t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`**: These values remain unchanged.
4. **`u`**: `u` is now `u - 2` and must be a truthy value.
5. **`c` and `d`**: These are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Length of `b`**:
   - Let `len(a) = L`.
   - The number of new elements added to `b` is `2 * (L - 3)`.
   - Therefore, the total length of `b` after extension is `len(b) + 2 * (L - 3)`.

2. **Understanding the New Elements in `b`**:
   - Each pair of new elements is added based on the conditions involving `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`.
   - The exact values of these new elements depend on the specific values of `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`, but they are either `b[-2] + v` or `b[-2] + 1` for the first element, and `b[-1] + v` or `b[-1] + 1` for the second element.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is such that if `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

4. **Index Calculation**:
   - The indices used in the print statement are `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.
   - These indices refer to the elements in the extended `b` list.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` calculates the difference between the elements at the specified indices.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `b` at the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where `b` is the extended list, `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`, and the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` refer to elements in the extended `b` list)**.
