To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`a`**: Has its original length.
2. **`b`**: Has been extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements. Each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows:
   - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
   - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.
3. **`t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`**: Remain unchanged.
4. **`u`**: Is now `u - 2` and must be a truthy value.
5. **`c` and `d`**: Are assigned the values returned by the function `r()`.
6. **Comparison of `c` and `d`**:
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is initially some list.
   - It is extended by `2 * (len(a) - 3)` elements.
   - Each pair of new elements is calculated based on the conditions involving `v`, `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y`.

2. **Understanding `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`.
   - The comparison `c < d` or `c >= d` is made, but this does not change their values; it only confirms their relationship.

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - The indices used in the `print` statement are `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - These indices refer to specific elements in the extended list `b`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` calculates the difference between the elements at the specified indices in `b`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result.
- However, we know that `c` and `d` are indices into the list `b`, and the print statement will output the difference between the elements at these indices.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `c` and `d`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`, and `b` is the list extended as described in the initial state)**
