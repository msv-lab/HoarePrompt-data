Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is the value returned by `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 1 and is assumed to be truthy, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the program continues with these conditions unchanged. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the program also continues with these conditions unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 2 and is assumed to be truthy, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. Regardless of whether `c` is less than `d` or `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the program continues with these conditions unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is the value returned by `r()` minus 3, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by `r()`. If `c` < `d`, the program follows the conditions specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the conditions specified in the else part.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
