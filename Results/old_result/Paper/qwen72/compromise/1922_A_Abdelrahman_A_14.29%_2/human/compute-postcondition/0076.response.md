The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
   - `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `b` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `c` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `tests` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `no` is True.
   - `x` is the second character of `c`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It is a straightforward print statement that outputs a constant string.
- Therefore, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
