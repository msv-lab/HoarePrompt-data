The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `tests`. The loop will execute if `tests` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
