To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20.
   - `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `b` is an input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `c` is an input string of length `n` (where `n` >= 1) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
   - `tests` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `x` is the second character of `c`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `no` remains True.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed without any conditions directly affecting it in the given code snippet.
   - The value of `no` is not used in the `print` statement, and the `print` statement does not depend on any other variables or conditions that are described in the initial state or the conditions.

Since the `print('YES')` statement is a simple output statement and does not depend on any of the conditions or variables mentioned in the initial state, it will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `i`, `slength`, or `x`.

Output: **YES**
