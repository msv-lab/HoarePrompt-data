### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of pile sizes `arr`.
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to determine the winner.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` containing the unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size (the first element in `set_`) is not 1, Alice wins immediately because she can choose `k` to be the smallest pile size and empty all piles in one move.

4. **Iterate Over Unique Pile Sizes:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted unique pile sizes starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it toggles the value of `A` (i.e., `A = not A`).

5. **Final Check:**
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are 1), it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Initial Check:**
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` to be the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move. This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Correctness of the Iteration:**
  - The program correctly identifies if the pile sizes are consecutive integers starting from 1. If they are not, it breaks the loop and sets `not_c` to `False`.
  - The toggling of `A` during the iteration is meant to simulate the turns of the game. If the pile sizes are consecutive, the number of turns will be equal to the number of unique pile sizes, and the final value of `A` will determine the winner.

- **Final Check:**
  - If `not_c` is `True`, it means all pile sizes are consecutive, and the number of turns will be odd if the number of unique pile sizes is even, and vice versa. The final toggling of `A` correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
