The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of positive integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns the string 'Alice' in both cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and always returns the string 'Alice'.**
