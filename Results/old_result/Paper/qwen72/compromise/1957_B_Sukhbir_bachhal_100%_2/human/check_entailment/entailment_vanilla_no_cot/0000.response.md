Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not always generate the correct sequence of non-negative integers that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR, while also ensuring that their sum equals `k`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`. However, the program uses this function to determine the value of the first element in the sequence, which is `2 ** counter - 1`. This value is not always the best choice to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Sequence Construction:**
   - The program constructs the sequence by setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element to `k - arr[-1]`. This approach does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. For example, if `k` is a small number, the first element might be too large, and the second element might be negative or zero, which does not satisfy the problem constraints.

3. **Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The program appends `0` to the sequence for the remaining `n-2` elements. This is not optimal because it does not contribute to the bitwise OR, and there might be better ways to distribute the sum `k` among the elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence, you should:
- Distribute the sum `k` among the `n` elements in such a way that as many bits as possible are set to 1.
- One effective strategy is to use the smallest powers of 2 that sum up to `k` and distribute them among the elements. If `k` is larger than the sum of the smallest `n-1` powers of 2, you can set the remaining sum to the last element.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        # Initialize the array with 0s
        arr = [0] * n
        # Distribute the sum k among the elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR
        for i in range(n-1):
            if k == 0:
                break
            arr[i] = 1 << (i % 30)  # Use the smallest powers of 2
            k -= arr[i]
        arr[-1] = k  # Assign the remaining sum to the last element
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)
```

This solution ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. The use of the smallest powers of 2 helps in setting as many bits as possible to 1.
