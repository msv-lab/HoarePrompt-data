Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the first `hd` positions, and `hd` is `a1 - a2 - min(hd, n)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the loop starts, and `hd` is the remaining value of `a1 - a2` after decrementing `hd` by 1 for each iteration where `hd` was greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `hd` is not greater than 0, and `hd` is the final value of `a1 - a2` after all adjustments in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
