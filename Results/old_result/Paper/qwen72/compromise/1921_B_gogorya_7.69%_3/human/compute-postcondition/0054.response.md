Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[1]` is '1' and `s2[1]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is `hd - 1`. Otherwise, `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.**
