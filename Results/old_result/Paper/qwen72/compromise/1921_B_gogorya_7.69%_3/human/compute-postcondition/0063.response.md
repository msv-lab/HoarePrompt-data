Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the loop starts, and `hd` is the remaining value of `a1 - a2` after decrementing `hd` by 1 for each iteration where `hd` was greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `s1` is assigned the value of the new input string.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, `res`, and `hd` remain unchanged from the initial state.
