The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.**
