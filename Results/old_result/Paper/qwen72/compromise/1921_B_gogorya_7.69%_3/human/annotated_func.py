#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, where '1' indicates the presence of a cat and '0' indicates the absence of a cat. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `s1` is the last input string, `s2` is the last input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `hd` is not greater than 0, and `hd` is the final value of `a1 - a2` after all adjustments in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing '0' and '1' characters. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s1` and `s2`, and then adjusts this difference by counting the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0', but only if the initial difference is not positive. The function prints the final adjusted difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer, `s1` and `s2` being the last input strings, and `res` being the final adjusted difference for the last test case.
