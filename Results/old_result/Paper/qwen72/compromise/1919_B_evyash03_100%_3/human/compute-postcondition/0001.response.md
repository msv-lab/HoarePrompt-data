The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `length` is a positive integer and is equal to the length of `expression`, and `count` is 0, the loop will execute if `expression` has at least one character.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a string with at least one character, and `char` should be the first character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of characters "+" and "-" and must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` is equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 0**
