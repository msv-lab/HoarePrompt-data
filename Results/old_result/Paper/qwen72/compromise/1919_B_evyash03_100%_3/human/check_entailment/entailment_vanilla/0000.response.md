Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in the string corresponds to an array `a` where `+` is `1` and `-` is `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `expression` and `length` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string and calculates the number of `-` characters as `length - count`.
   - It returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-` characters.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters.
   - However, this does not directly correspond to the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem.
   - The minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - For example, in the case of `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`.
   - The given program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays; it simply calculates the difference in counts of `+` and `-` characters.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
