Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**

The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `b` with a new list of integers provided by the user. The new list `b` is not necessarily sorted, but it will contain integers. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
