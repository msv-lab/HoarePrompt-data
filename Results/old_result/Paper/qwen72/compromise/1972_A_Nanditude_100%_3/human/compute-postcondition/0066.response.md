Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where \(1 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \ldots \leq b_n \leq 10^9\).
- `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.
- `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to `a[i]` before the loop started, or `n` if all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(cnt)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `cnt` is defined as the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.
- The variable `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to `a[i]` before the loop started, or `n` if all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.
   - Since `b` is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can use binary search or a simple loop to count the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.

2. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is the index in `b` where the elements are greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
   - If all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`, then `i` would be `n` (since `i` would be out of bounds).

3. **Calculating `cnt`**:
   - If `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` is `i - 1`.
   - If all elements in `b` are less than `a[i]`, then `i` is `n`, and `cnt` would be `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `cnt` will be the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than all elements in `b`, then `cnt` will be `n`.
- If `a[i]` is less than or equal to some elements in `b`, then `cnt` will be the index of the first element in `b` that is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]`)**

This description is precise and based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
