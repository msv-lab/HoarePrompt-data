Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, and if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is 0 or 1, depending on the condition `b[j] < a[i]`.
- The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `i` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` depends on the condition `b[j] < a[i]`, which is now `b[1] < a[1]`. If this condition is true, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` is 0.
