Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` or `n` if all elements in `a` are less than the corresponding elements in `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so the variable `_` is incremented by `n`.
- The variable `j` is the loop index and will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- The variable `cnt` will count the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`. If all elements in `a` are less than the corresponding elements in `b`, `i` will be `n`.
