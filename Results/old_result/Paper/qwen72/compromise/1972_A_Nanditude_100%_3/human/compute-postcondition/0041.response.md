Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `b[j]` < `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same except that the variable `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` are unchanged. The variable `_` has also been incremented by 1. The condition for `cnt` remains the same, but `i` is now one step further in the list `a`.
