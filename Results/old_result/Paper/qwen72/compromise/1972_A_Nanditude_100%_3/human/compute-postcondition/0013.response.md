The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of the list `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. The loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each new iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 1**
