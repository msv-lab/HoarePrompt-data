Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]` initializes the list `dp` to a length of `m + 1`, where each element is 0.
- The previous values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, and `num` remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` mentioned in the initial state are no longer valid, as the entire list is reinitialized to 0s.
- The conditions that `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 still hold.
