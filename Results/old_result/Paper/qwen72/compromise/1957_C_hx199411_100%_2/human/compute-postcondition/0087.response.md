The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers with certain constraints, so the new values must adhere to these constraints.

Here is the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers from the input and splits them by a space. These integers are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k`.
2. **Updating `n` and `k`**: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The constraints for `n` and `k` remain the same: 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

The initial state also includes:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`

Since the code only updates `n` and `k`, the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the list `dp` remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m - 1` and the list `dp` is populated according to the given formula for each `j` from 3 to `m`.**
