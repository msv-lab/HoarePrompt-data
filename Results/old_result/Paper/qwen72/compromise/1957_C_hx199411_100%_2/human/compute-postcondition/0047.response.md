To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, as `range(k)` will iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m`
- `num` is 0
- `m` is `n - num` which is `n`
- If `m` is 0, the function does not modify `dp`
- If `m` is 1, the function does not modify `dp`
- If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

1. `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Since `i` is not directly set to 0 in the initial state, we need to ensure it is 0 before the loop starts. The value of `k` is already given as 1 ≤ k ≤ n, so it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num` which is `n`, if `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`**
