Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- The current value of `m` is 0.

Given the initial state, we can deduce the following:
- Since `m` is defined as `n - num` and the current value of `m` is 0, it implies that `num` must be equal to `n`.
- This means that the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r` must be exactly `n`.

The code snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

This code snippet simply prints the integer 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **1**
