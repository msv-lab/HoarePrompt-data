Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `m`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop runs from `3` to `m + 1` (exclusive), so the last value `i` takes is `m`.
- **`num`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`dp`**: The list `dp` is updated in the loop. Each element from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain `1` and `3` respectively, and the rest of the elements are computed according to the loop.

Thus, the final state of `dp` will have all elements from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` filled with the values computed by the loop, while the other variables remain as they were initially.
