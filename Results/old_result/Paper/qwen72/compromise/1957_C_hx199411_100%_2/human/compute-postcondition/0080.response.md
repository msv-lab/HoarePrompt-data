Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k + 1`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[k - 1]` which is `(dp[k - 2] + (k - 2) * dp[k - 3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[k]` which is `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[k + 1]` which is `(dp[k] + k * dp[k - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.
