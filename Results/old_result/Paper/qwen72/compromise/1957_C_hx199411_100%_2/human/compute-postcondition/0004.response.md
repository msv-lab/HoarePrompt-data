Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. `num` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^4 - 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case, with `n` in the range 1 to 3 \cdot 10^5 and `k` in the range 0 to `n`.
- Each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the `n` \times `n` chessboard.
- The code snippet `num = 0` initializes the variable `num` to 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the initial conditions for `r_i` and `c_i` still hold.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `num` and retains all other initial conditions.
