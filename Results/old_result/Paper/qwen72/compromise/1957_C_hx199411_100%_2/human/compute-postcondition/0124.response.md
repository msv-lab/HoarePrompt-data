To determine what will be printed when the `print(dp[m])` statement executes, let's break down the initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `m + 1`.

2. **Variable `m`**:
   - `m` is defined as `n - num`.

3. **Variable `dp[m]`**:
   - `dp[m]` is the final computed value of the loop.
   - All elements from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]` have been updated according to the loop formula.

Given this information, we can infer the following:

- The value of `m` is `n - num`.
- The value of `i` is `m + 1`, which means `i` is `n - num + 1`.
- The `dp` list has been updated from index 3 to index `m` according to some loop formula.
- The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp` at index `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `num` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m` or the exact value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the given information, we know that `dp[m]` is the final computed value of the loop.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the final computed value of the loop, and m is n - num)**
