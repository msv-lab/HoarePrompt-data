Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
2. `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
4. `i` is set to `m`.
5. `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`.
6. `m` is calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 3.
7. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except:
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `dp[i]` for \(3 \leq i \leq m\) is calculated as \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \% 10\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `m`**:
   - `m` is defined as `n - num`.
   - `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each move where `c` does not equal `r`.
   - Since `m` must be at least 3, `num` must be such that `n - num` is at least 3. This implies \(n - 3 \leq num \leq n\).

2. **Understanding `dp`**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`.
   - The first two elements are explicitly defined:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
   - For \(3 \leq i \leq m\), each element is calculated using the formula:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`

3. **Calculating `dp[m]`**:
   - We need to compute the value of `dp[m]` based on the given formula.
   - The value of `dp[m]` depends on the values of `dp[m-1]` and `dp[m-2]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume a small example to understand the calculation better:
- Suppose `n = 5` and `num = 2`, then `m = n - num = 5 - 2 = 3`.
- We need to compute `dp[3]`:
  - `dp[1] = 1`
  - `dp[2] = 3`
  - `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % 10 = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % 10 = (3 + 4) % 10 = 7`

### General Case:
- For any `m` where `m` is at least 3, the value of `dp[m]` is calculated using the given formula.
- The exact value of `dp[m]` will depend on the values of `dp[m-1]` and `dp[m-2]`, which are computed recursively.

### Final Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is calculated using the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2] \cdot 2) \% 10\) for \(3 \leq i \leq m\).

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value calculated using the formula (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10 for 3 ≤ i ≤ m)**
