The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `c` and `r` are now specific integers provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, `dp`, and `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 2, `m` is `n`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^4)`, `c` and `r` are specific input integers, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4.**
