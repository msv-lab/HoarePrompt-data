Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The loop variable `i` will have iterated from `k - 1` to `m - 1` by the time the loop completes.
- The variable `m` remains `n - num`, and it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- The list `dp` will have been updated such that each element from index 3 to `m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `j` is the current index in the loop. The first two elements of `dp` (at indices 1 and 2) remain 1 and 3, respectively.
