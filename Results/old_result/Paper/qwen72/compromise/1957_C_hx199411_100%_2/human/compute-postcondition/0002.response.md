Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`.
- The initial range for `t` was 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, so after decrementing, the new range for `t` is 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and the positions `r_i` and `c_i` remain unchanged.
