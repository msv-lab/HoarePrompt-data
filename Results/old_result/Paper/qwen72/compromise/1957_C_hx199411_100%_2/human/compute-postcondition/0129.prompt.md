You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, which are valid positions on the n \times n chessboard.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop. `m` is `n - num` for each test case. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The function prints `dp[m]` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `k` moves represented by pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, which are valid positions on an `n \times n` chessboard. The function processes these moves and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
