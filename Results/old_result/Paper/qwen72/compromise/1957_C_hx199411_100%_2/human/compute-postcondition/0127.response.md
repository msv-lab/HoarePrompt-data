Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the total number of `c` and `r` values read, where `num` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` and by 2 if `c` does not equal `r` for each iteration of the loop. `m` is `n - num` for each test case. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0 except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The function prints `dp[m]` for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variables `n` and `k` will have been read from the input, and `num` will have been calculated based on the moves provided. The variable `m` will be `n - num` for each test case. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function will print 1. If `m` is at least 3, the list `dp` will be populated with values according to the given formula, and the function will print `dp[m]` for each test case. The state of the other variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
