Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an n \times n chessboard, considering the rules of the game and the moves already made. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already made `k`.

2. **Counting Initial Moves**: It counts the number of rooks already placed on the board, distinguishing between the cases where the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`) and where it is not. Each non-diagonal move effectively blocks two positions (one for the white rook and one for the black rook), while a diagonal move only blocks one position.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program sets up a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of remaining positions `m`. The base cases are:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: If there is only one position left, there is only one configuration.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: If there are two positions left, there are three configurations: placing a white rook in one position and a black rook in the other, or placing a rook in both positions (which results in the same configuration).

4. **DP Transition**: The program fills the DP array using the recurrence relation:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`: This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. The term `dp[i - 1]` represents placing a rook in one of the positions and the term `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` represents placing a pair of rooks in two positions, considering the two possible colors for the pair.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions `m`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the final configurations are counted modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.
