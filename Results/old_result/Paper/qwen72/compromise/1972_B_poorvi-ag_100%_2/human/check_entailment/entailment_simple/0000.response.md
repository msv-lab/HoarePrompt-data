### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial state of the coins `arr`.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game is won by the player who can make the last valid move.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, and vice versa.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win because he can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, and vice versa.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function uses the `count` method to count the number of `'U'` in the string `arr`.
   - It appends `'yes'` to the `results` list if the count of `'U'` is odd, and `'no'` if the count is even.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - For `n = 1`, if the coin is facing up, Alice wins. If it is facing down, Bob wins.
   - For `n = 2`, if both coins are facing up, Alice wins by removing one and leaving the other. If both are facing down, Bob wins.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The function assumes both players play optimally, which is correct based on the problem description.
   - The logic of checking the parity of the number of facing-up coins is optimal and ensures the correct winner is determined.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
