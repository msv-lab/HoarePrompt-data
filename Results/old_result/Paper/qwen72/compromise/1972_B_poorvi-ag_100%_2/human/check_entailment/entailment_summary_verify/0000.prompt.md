You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". The function then determines if the count of "U" in `s` is odd or even and appends "yes" or "no" to a list `results` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results`, indicating whether the count of "U" in each test case is odd ("yes") or even ("no"). The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation**:
The program provided does not correctly handle the game rules as described in the problem. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of 'U' coins is odd or even and decides the winner based on that. However, this approach does not consider the actual game mechanics, such as the removal of a coin and the flipping of adjacent coins.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input**:
```
1
4
UUDU
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NO
```

**Actual Output**:
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Case**:
- The initial state is "UUDU".
- Alice can only choose the first or the last 'U' coin. Let's say she chooses the first 'U' coin.
  - After removing the first 'U' coin, the state becomes "DDU".
  - The two adjacent coins (second and third) are flipped, resulting in "UUD".
- Bob can choose the first 'U' coin.
  - After removing the first 'U' coin, the state becomes "UD".
  - The two adjacent coins (second and third) are flipped, resulting in "DD".
- Alice can choose the first 'D' coin.
  - After removing the first 'D' coin, the state becomes "D".
  - No coins are flipped because there is only one coin left.
- Bob can choose the only remaining 'D' coin.
  - After removing the 'D' coin, the state becomes empty.
- Alice cannot make a move now, so Bob wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the parity of the number of 'U' coins, which is 2 (even) in this case. However, the game mechanics and optimal play strategy show that Bob can win this game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
