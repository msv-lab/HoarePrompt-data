Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the last character of `s`; `a` contains all unique characters from `s`, and the length of `a` is greater than 1; `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (starting from the middle) with the first half of `s` (up to the middle). If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.***
