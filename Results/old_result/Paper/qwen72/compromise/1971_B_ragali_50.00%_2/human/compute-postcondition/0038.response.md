The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - `a` is a set that contains all unique characters from `s`, and the set `a` contains more than one unique character.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement is simply printing a constant string `'YES'`, the values of `s`, `i`, and `a` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
