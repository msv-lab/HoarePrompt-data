Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the last character of `s`; `a` contains all unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and if `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. Otherwise, `isreverse` is equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, no changes are made to `s`, `i`, or `a`.***
