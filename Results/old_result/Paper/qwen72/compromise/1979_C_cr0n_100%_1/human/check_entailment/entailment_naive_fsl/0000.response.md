Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of outcomes \( n \) is 1. According to the problem description, the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If \( n = 1 \), the only outcome is the winning one, and the total amount bet is equal to the amount received back, which does not satisfy the condition of being strictly less.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1
5
```
The program will output:
```
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
-1
```
This is because if you bet 1 coin on the only outcome, you will receive back \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) coins, which is not strictly greater than the total amount bet (1 coin). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
