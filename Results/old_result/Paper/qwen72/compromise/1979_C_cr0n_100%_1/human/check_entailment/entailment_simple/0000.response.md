### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the amount received back is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(k_i\) is the multiplier and \(x_i\) is the bet on that outcome.
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads \(N\) (the number of outcomes) and the list of multipliers \(vals\).

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
     - It is used to find the LCM of all elements in the list `vals`.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - **Initialization:**
       - `den` is initialized to the first element of `vals`.
     - **LCM Calculation:**
       - The program iterates through `vals` and updates `den` to the LCM of `den` and the current element.
       - After the loop, `den` contains the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
     - **Bet Calculation:**
       - The program calculates `vprod` as a list where each element is \(\frac{den}{r}\) for each \(r\) in `vals`.
       - The total amount bet is then calculated as the sum of `vprod`.
       - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
     - **Condition Check:**
       - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints \(-1\) and returns, indicating no valid distribution of coins.
       - If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The LCM of all multipliers \(k_i\) is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - The bets \(x_i\) are calculated as \(\frac{LCM}{k_i}\).
     - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{LCM}{k_i}\).
     - The program then checks if the LCM minus the total amount bet is greater than 0.
   - **Condition Satisfaction:**
     - For the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) to hold for all \(i\), the LCM must be greater than the sum of the bets.
     - If the LCM is not greater than the sum of the bets, the program correctly outputs \(-1\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the LCM is not sufficient to satisfy the condition by outputting \(-1\).
   - The program also handles cases where a valid distribution exists by outputting the bets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case, and it handles cases where no valid distribution exists by outputting \(-1\). Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
