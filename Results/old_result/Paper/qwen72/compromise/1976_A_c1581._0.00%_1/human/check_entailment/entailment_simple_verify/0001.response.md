### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input by iterating over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password and the password itself.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described. `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It first separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The state after the for loop is correctly described. `digits` contains all the digits from the string `password` in the same order they appear, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the same order they appear.
   - It then checks if any digit appears after a letter. If it does, the function immediately returns 'NO'.
     - **Annotation Verification:** The state after this check is correctly described. `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`, or -1 if there are no digits in `password`.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - **Annotation Verification:** The state after this check is correctly described. `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Finally, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - **Annotation Verification:** The state after this check is correctly described. `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.
     - **Annotation Verification:** The final state is correctly described. `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that the length \( n \) is at least 1).
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the program handles these edge cases correctly.

4. **Logic:**
   - The logic for separating digits and letters is straightforward and correct.
   - The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is also correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is implemented by tracking the last index of a digit and checking if any letter appears after it.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the logic is implemented correctly and the program behaves as expected.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them all at once, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the output is collected and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to validate the passwords according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each key point.

Final: **True**
