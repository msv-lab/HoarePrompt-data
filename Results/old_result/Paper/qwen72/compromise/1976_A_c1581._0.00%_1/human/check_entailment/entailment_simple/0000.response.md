### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the program extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list `data`.

2. **Password Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for verifying if the password meets the strong password criteria.
   - The function first separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters.
   - It then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by maintaining a variable `last_digit_index` which keeps track of the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is found after a digit, the function returns 'NO'.
   - The function also checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem description guarantees that the length `n` is between 1 and 20 inclusive).

4. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end, separated by newlines.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. It handles all the specified criteria and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****
