Output State: **`a` is a binary string input by the user, `b` is a binary string input by the user, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `j` to 0. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `j` being 0.
