Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'), and their lengths n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order, `j` is the index in `b` where the next unmatched character would be found or `m` if all characters in `b` have been checked.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively, and then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input. It calculates the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the unchanged binary strings `a` and `b`, the unchanged lengths `n` and `m`, and the printed count `k`.
