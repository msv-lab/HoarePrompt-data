Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` only processes a single test case and then terminates, which means it will not correctly handle the input format where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t`. For the program to be correct, it must include a loop to process each test case individually, as suggested in the original assessment. Without this loop, the program will fail to produce the correct output for any input with more than one test case.

Final: **False**
