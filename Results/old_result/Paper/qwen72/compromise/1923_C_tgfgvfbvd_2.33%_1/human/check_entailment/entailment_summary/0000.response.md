Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by checking if a subarray is "good" based on the criteria provided. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` (with appropriate boundary checks).

2. **Query Processing**: For each query `(a, b)`, the program determines the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b]` using the prefix sums. It then checks two conditions:
   - The length of the subarray must be greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
   - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

3. **Output**: If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has at least two elements. This is necessary because if the subarray has only one element, it cannot satisfy the condition `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`.
- **Condition 2**: `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for a different set of positive integers `b_i` that also sum to the same value as `a_i` while ensuring `a_i ≠ b_i`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Subarray**: The program correctly handles single-element subarrays by printing 'NO' because they cannot be "good" as per the problem statement.
- **Subarray Sum Calculation**: The program correctly handles the calculation of the subarray sum using the prefix sums, which is efficient and avoids recalculating the sum for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given criteria. It efficiently processes the input and produces the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
