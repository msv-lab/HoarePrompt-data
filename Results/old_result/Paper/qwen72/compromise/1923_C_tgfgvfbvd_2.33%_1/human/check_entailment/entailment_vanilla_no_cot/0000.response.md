Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes the input to handle multiple test cases, computes prefix sums for the array `c`, and then evaluates each query to determine if the specified subarray is "good" according to the given conditions. The logic for checking if a subarray is good is implemented correctly, ensuring that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray plus the number of elements in the subarray, which aligns with the requirement that each element in the corresponding array `b` must be different and greater than 0.
