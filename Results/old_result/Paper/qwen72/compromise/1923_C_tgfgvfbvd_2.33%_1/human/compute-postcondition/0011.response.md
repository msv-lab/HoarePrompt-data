The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in `l`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element in the list `l`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the values `c + x` and `c`, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`.**
