Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, `c` is the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the second element in `l`.** 

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated to be the sum of the first and second elements in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
