Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`. If the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` in `l` is greater than 1 and `s` is at least twice the length of this subarray, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b - 1` is 1 or less, or `s` is less than twice the length of this subarray.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in `l`, `m` is now `m - 1`, and `s` is now `p[b - 1]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the specific condition within the if part is met. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in `l`, `m` is now `m - 1`, and `s` is now `p[b - 1]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the specific condition within the if part is met. Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met. `m` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
