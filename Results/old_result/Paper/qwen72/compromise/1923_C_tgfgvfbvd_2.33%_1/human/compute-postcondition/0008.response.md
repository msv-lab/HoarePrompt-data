The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` must have at least 1 element, and `x` was the last element processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the next (second) element in the list.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the value `c + x`, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`**
