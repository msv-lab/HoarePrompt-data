Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to the index `b - 1`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is updated to `s - p[a - 2]`.***
