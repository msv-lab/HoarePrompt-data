Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `m` is 0, `x` is the last element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, `c` is equal to the first element in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the first element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l` and the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, `c` is now equal to the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the second element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the first element of `l`, the sum of the first and second elements in `l`, and the sum of the first, second, and third elements in `l`, `c` is now equal to the sum of the first, second, and third elements in `l`, `m` is 0, `x` is the third element in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
