Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the values `c + x` and `c`, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the value `c + x`. After appending `c`, `p` now contains two elements: `c + x` and `c`. The value of `c` remains updated to `c + x`, and `x` is still the second element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
