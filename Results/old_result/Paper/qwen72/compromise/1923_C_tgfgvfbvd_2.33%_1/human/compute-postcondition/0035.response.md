Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, if `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index minus `p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to the `(b-1)`-th index, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- `a` and `b` are now assigned the values provided by the user input, which are split and converted to integers.
- The conditions and logic involving `a`, `b`, and `s` remain as described in the initial state, but `a` and `b` now have specific values provided by the user.
