The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop iterates `m` times. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4), `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0**
