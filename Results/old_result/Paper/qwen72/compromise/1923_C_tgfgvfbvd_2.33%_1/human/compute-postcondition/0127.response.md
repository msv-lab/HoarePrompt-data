To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **User Input and Variable Initialization:**
   - `a` and `b` are updated to values provided by user input.
   - `n` and `m` are updated to values provided by user input.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `x` is the last element in `l`.
   - `m` is updated to `m - 1`.
   - `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`.

2. **Conditional Updates:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, a specific condition within the if part is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition within the else part is met.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print('NO')` is executed.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions described. This is because the print statement itself does not depend on any of the variables or conditions; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
