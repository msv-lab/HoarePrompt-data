### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `a` and adjusts `k` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings `a`.
   - The function initializes `x` to be the rating of your cow `a[k]`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two elements that have a rating greater than `x` and stores these indices in the list `ind`.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No elements greater than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - If no elements in `a` are greater than `x`, your cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Exactly one element greater than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If there is exactly one element greater than `x`, the function checks if this element is at index 0.
       - If it is, the function returns `k - 1` (the number of matches your cow can win if it is not the first cow).
       - If it is not at index 0, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - **Case 3: Two or more elements greater than `x` (`len(ind) >= 2`):**
     - If there are two or more elements greater than `x`, the function checks if the first element is at index 0.
       - If it is, the function returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
       - If it is not, the function checks if `k` is greater than `ind[1]`.
         - If `k` is greater than `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
         - If `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

### Issues:
- **Undefined Variable `n`:**
  - The variable `n` is used in the function `func_1` but is not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter or defined within the function.
- **Incorrect Return Values:**
  - In the case where `ind` is empty, the function should return `n - 1`, but `n` is not defined in the function.
  - In the case where `len(ind) == 1` and `ind[0] == 0`, the function returns `k - 1`, which is incorrect because `k` is the index of your cow, and the return value should be based on the number of matches your cow can win.

### Corrected Function:
To fix the issues, we need to pass `n` and `k` as parameters to `func_1` and ensure the return values are correct.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l, n, k))

def func_1(a, n, k):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return max(0, k - 1)  # Ensure the return value is non-negative
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected function is used.
- **False** if the original function is used without corrections.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the issues mentioned above, the original program is incorrect).
