#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure or external method not shown in the function definition. Typically, it would involve reading multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: After all iterations, the variable `t` (number of test cases) is reduced to 0, and for each test case, the variable `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, and `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the number of test cases `t` is implicitly reduced to 0.
