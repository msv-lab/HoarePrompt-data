Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. This can lead to incorrect results if the input values for `x` are such that the conditions cannot be met with `a[0]` fixed at 500. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 1
```

The program will set `a[0]` to 500, `a[1]` to 501, and `a[2]` to 502. However, this does not satisfy the condition `a_3 % a_2 = 1` because `502 % 501 = 1`, but `a_2 % a_1` should also equal 1, and `501 % 500 = 1` is not necessarily true for all inputs. A correct solution should allow `a[0]` to be any value that can satisfy the conditions for the given `x` values.
