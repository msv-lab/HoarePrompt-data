Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, `x` is a list of integers.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that `x` is now a list of integers obtained from the input.
