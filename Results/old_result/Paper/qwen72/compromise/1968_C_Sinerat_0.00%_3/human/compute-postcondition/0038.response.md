Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
     - The first element of `a` is 500.
     - Each subsequent element of `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
   - `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Understanding the List `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is explicitly given as 500.
   - For the subsequent elements, the value of `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [100, 200, 300]`.
   - The list `a` will be constructed as follows:
     - `a[0] = 500`
     - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 100 = 600`
     - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 600 + 200 = 800`
     - `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 800 + 300 = 1100`
   - Therefore, `a` will be `[500, 600, 800, 1100]`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

5. **General Case:**
   - The first element of `a` is always 500.
   - Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

Given the initial state and the construction of the list `a`, the output will be the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where `x` is the list of integers provided by the user and `n` is the input integer greater than 0).
