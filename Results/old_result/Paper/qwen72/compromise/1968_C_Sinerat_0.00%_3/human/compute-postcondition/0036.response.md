Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is 500 + `x[0]`, the third element is 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the fourth element is 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, and the rest are 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[3]` (since `i` is 3) to be the sum of `a[2]` and `x[2]`.
- Given the initial state, `a[2]` is 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and `x[2]` is the third element of the list `x`.
- Therefore, `a[3]` becomes 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and the list `x` remain unchanged.
- The rest of the elements in the list `a` remain 0.
