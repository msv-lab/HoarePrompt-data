The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the number of test cases `t` is implicitly reduced to 0.
