The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. `n` represents the number of moves, and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return values or conditions are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It is designed to process these inputs to determine some outcome related to the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in a tower, but the exact return values or conditions are not specified.**
