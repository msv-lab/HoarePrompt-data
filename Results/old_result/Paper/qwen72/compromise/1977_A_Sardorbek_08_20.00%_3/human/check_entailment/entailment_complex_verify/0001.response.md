### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower for each move. This is always possible, so the program correctly prints "YES".
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible for Nikita to have `c` cubes after `b` moves because he can only add or remove one cube per move. The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3: `a % 2 == b % 2`**
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, this is incorrect. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) should not influence the result for each individual test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is the same, it means that the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which allows for the possibility of reaching exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and an even number of moves can balance out the additions and removals to reach the desired number of cubes.
   - **Case 4: Else**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program correctly prints "No".

3. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check if it is possible to have exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves is `b % 2 == c % 2`. This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the possibility of reaching the desired number of cubes.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to ensure the program's correctness. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
