### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired height.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes.
   - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) should not influence the result. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` must have the same parity for it to be possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. If `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve the desired height.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions. However, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect and should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to determine if the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`.
