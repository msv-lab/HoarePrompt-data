Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has a logical error in the condition that checks if the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` can result in a tower with exactly `c` cubes. The correct condition should be checking if `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == m:
            print('YES')
        elif n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` is the same, which is a necessary condition for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve the desired tower height; otherwise, it is not.
