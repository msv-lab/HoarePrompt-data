Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. If this condition is true, it prints `2`. This is correct because if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2` (one from each installation, since no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap within `m` minutes).

3. **Calculation for General Case**: If `m` is not less than either `a` or `b`, the function calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is intended to count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes and add 2 to account for the initial fireworks launched at time 0.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `a` and `b` are both 1, the function will print `m // 1 + m // 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `m + m + 2` or `2 * m + 2`. This is correct because each installation will launch a firework every minute, and the visibility period is `m + 1` minutes, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be `2 * (m + 1) - 1` (since the last minute of the first firework overlaps with the first minute of the next firework). However, the function simplifies this to `2 * m + 2`, which is also correct.
   - For the case where `a` and `b` are large and `m` is also large, the function will correctly calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m` minutes and add 2 for the initial fireworks.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case, as described in the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue with the formula used in the general case. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by the same installation. Specifically, if `m` is large enough, the number of fireworks visible at the same time can be more than just the sum of the individual counts plus 2.

To correct this, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap between the two installations. Additionally, we need to account for the visibility period of each firework correctly.

Corrected Formula:
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is determined by the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of `m + 1` minutes, plus the initial fireworks.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
            max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm(a, b) + 1
            print(max_fireworks)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all t iterations. For each iteration, if m is less than a or b, the output is 2. Otherwise, the output is the sum of (m + 1) divided by a, (m + 1) divided by b, minus (m + 1) divided by the LCM of a and b, plus 1. The values of t, a, b, and m are unchanged after each iteration.
```

Given the original program, the reasoning for the correctness is flawed due to the incorrect formula used. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
