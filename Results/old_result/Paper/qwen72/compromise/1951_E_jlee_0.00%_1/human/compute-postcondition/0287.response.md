Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is a boolean. If the loop completes without breaking, `done` is False, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is the number of times `x` appears in `s` up to the index `j`. The current value of `done` is False.**
