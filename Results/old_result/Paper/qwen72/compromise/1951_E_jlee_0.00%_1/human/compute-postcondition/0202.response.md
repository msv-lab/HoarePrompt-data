Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 0, `count2` is equal to `count`, `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count` is equal to 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**
