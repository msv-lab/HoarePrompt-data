Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is 0 or greater.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the constant string `'YES'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
