The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
