Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and `done` is False. Additionally, `count` is greater than 1, which means that there exists a `j` such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is set to `j`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. `count2` is equal to `count`.**
