Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is a boolean. If the loop completes without breaking, `done` is False, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is the number of times `x` appears in `s` up to the index `j`. If the loop breaks, `done` is True, and the values of `count` and `count2` depend on the conditions that caused the loop to break.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The loop checks if the characters at the current index `j` and the corresponding index from the end of the list `s[n - 1 - j]` are different. If they are, it prints 'YES', the number 1, and the original string, sets `done` to True, and breaks out of the loop.
- If the characters at these indices are the same, it checks if the character at index `j` is different from the first character `x` and if `count` is less than 1. If so, it sets `count` to `j`.
- If `count` is greater than 0, it further checks if the character at index `j` is different from `x` and if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`. If so, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string split at index `j`, sets `done` to True, and breaks out of the loop.
- If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string split at index `j - 1`, sets `done` to True, and breaks out of the loop.
- If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is 1, it sets `count2` to 0 and continues to the next iteration.
- If `count2` is greater than `count`, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string split at index `j`, sets `done` to True, and breaks out of the loop.
- If `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, it continues to the next iteration.
- If the character at index `j` is equal to `x`, it increments `count2` by 1.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `done` remains False, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is the number of times `x` appears in `s` up to the index `j`.
