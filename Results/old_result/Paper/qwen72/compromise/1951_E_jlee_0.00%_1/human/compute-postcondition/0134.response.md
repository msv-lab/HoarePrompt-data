Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `done` remains False, and `count2` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `done`, and `count2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **YES**

The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.
