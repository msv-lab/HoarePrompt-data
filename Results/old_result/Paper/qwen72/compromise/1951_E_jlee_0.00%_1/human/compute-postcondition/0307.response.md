The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the same string, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
