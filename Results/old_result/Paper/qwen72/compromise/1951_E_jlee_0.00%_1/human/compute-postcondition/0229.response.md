Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is not changed. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 or greater and `done` is not changed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the same string.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
