The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the example. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer the possible return values based on typical use cases for such a function. However, without explicit output conditions, we can only state the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some value based on `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function returns a value based on the input parameters `n` and `m`, but the specific return conditions are not provided.**
