Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `b` and `c` (which correspond to `n` and `m` in the problem description).

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If `b` equals `c`**: This condition is correct because if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, Nikita can simply add a cube in each move to achieve the desired tower.
   - **If `b` is less than `c`**: This condition is also correct because if the number of moves `n` is less than the desired number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes since Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - **If `a % 2 == b % 2`**: This condition is incorrect. The parity of `a` (the number of test cases) should not be compared with the parity of `b` (the number of moves). Instead, the parity of `b` (the number of moves) should be compared with the parity of `c` (the desired number of cubes). This is because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. If `b` and `c` have the same parity, the difference `b - c` is even, and it is possible to achieve the desired tower.
   - **Else**: This condition is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to build the tower with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Output**: The function correctly prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions, and it handles the case sensitivity as required by the problem statement.

4. **Final State**: The final state of the program is correctly described. The loop has executed `a` times, and the last values of `b` and `c` are stored in the tuple `q`.

Given the incorrect condition `a % 2 == b % 2`, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
