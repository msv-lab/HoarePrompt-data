Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd) correctly. Specifically, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect and should be `b % 2 == c % 2` instead. 

For example, consider the test case where `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem description, it is possible to end up with a tower of 2 cubes after 4 moves (e.g., put, put, remove, remove). However, the program will output "No" because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`. 

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
