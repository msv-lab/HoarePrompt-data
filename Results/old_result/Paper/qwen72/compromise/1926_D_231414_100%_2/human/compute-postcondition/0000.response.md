The value of `times` is assigned the integer value provided by the input. The initial state mentions that the function should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, so `times` will hold the value of `t`. The list of lists containing non-negative integers is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`times` is an integer equal to `t`, the list of lists containing non-negative integers remains unchanged.**
