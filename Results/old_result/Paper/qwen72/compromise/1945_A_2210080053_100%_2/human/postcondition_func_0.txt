The function reads lines from the standard input, starting from the second line. For each line, it parses three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. It then increments `b` by `c` and prints a value based on the condition `c < b % 3`. If the condition is true, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `a - -b // 3`. The function does not return any value, but it processes and prints a result for each line of input after the first line.
