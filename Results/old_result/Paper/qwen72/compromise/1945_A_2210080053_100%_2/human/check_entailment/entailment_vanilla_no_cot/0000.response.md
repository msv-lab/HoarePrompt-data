Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling of Universal Participants (c):**
   - The program adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This is incorrect because universals can be used to satisfy the needs of both introverts and extroverts, but they should not be counted as extroverts without considering their flexibility.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program uses the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` to calculate the number of tents. This is problematic:
     - The expression `- -b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3`, which is the number of tents needed for extroverts if all extroverts are accommodated.
     - The expression `a - b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents, but it does not correctly account for the universals (`c`).
     - The condition `c < b % 3` is used to check if there are enough universals to satisfy the remaining extroverts, but it is not correctly implemented.

3. **Output for Impossible Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where it is impossible to satisfy the preferences of all participants. For example, if there are more extroverts than can be accommodated with the available universals, the program should output `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Ensure that all introverts are given their own tents.
2. Ensure that all extroverts are placed in tents with exactly two others.
3. Use the universals to fill in the remaining spots in the tents.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Introverts need their own tents
        tents = a
        
        # Extroverts need to be in tents with exactly two others
        if b * 3 > c + a:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Use universals to fill in the remaining spots for extroverts
        c -= min(c, b * 2)
        tents += b
        
        # Remaining universals can be placed in any tent
        if c > 0:
            tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Handling Introverts:**
   - Each introvert requires one tent, so `tents = a`.

3. **Handling Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. If the total number of extroverts (`b * 3`) is greater than the sum of universals and introverts (`c + a`), it is impossible to satisfy the preferences, and the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Using Universals:**
   - The program uses universals to fill in the remaining spots for extroverts. It subtracts the minimum of `c` and `b * 2` from `c` to account for the universals used to satisfy extroverts.
   - The number of tents needed for extroverts is added to the total (`tents += b`).

5. **Remaining Universals:**
   - Any remaining universals can be placed in any tent, so the program calculates the number of additional tents needed for the remaining universals using `(c + 2) // 3`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them at the end.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly and output the minimum number of tents needed or `-1` if it is impossible.
