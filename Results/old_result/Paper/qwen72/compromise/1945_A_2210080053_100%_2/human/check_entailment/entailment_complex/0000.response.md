### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads from the standard input, starting from the second line, which is correct as the first line contains the number of test cases.
   - It splits each line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Logic for Tents**:
   - The function increments `b` by `c` (`b += c`). This step is intended to account for the universals who can potentially fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents. This is a bit tricky to understand, but let's break it down:
     - `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // -3)`, which is a way to perform ceiling division in Python (i.e., `math.ceil(b / 3)`). This is because `b // -3` will round towards negative infinity, and negating it will give the ceiling value.
     - `a - -b // 3` is then intended to calculate the total number of tents needed. `a` represents the number of tents needed for introverts, and `-b // 3` represents the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` is used to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If `c` is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement, and the function prints `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the test case `1 2 3`, the function correctly calculates 3 tents.
   - For the test case `1 4 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement.
   - For the test case `1 4 2`, the function correctly calculates 3 tents.
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement.
   - For the test case `1 3 2`, the function correctly calculates 3 tents.
   - For the test case `19 7 18`, the function correctly calculates 28 tents.
   - For the test case `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints 0 tents.
   - For the test case `7 0 0`, the function correctly prints 7 tents.
   - For the test case `0 24 0`, the function correctly prints 8 tents.
   - For the test case `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the function correctly calculates 1666666667 tents.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is mathematically correct but can be confusing. A more readable way to express this would be `a + (b + 2) // 3`.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` is correct for checking if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the given test cases correctly. The only potential issue is the readability of the expression `a - -b // 3`, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
