To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution.
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each `i`, `ans1` is set to the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.

2. **Condition 1: `ans1 == '<'`**
   - If `func_1` returns '<', `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - This means that `pair_idx` will be the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<'.

3. **Condition 2: `ans1 == '='`
   - If `func_1` returns '=', `ans2` is set to the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.
   - If `ans2` returns '>', `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.

### Key Observations:
- The loop is designed to update `pair_idx` based on the results of `func_1`.
- `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<'.
- `pair_idx` will be updated to the highest value of `i` that either satisfies `ans1 == '<'` or `ans1 == '='` and `ans2 == '>'`.

### Final State:
- After the loop completes, `pair_idx` will be the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'.
- `max_item_idx` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`pair_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'. `max_item_idx` remains unchanged.**
