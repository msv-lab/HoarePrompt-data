The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The loop starts with `i` being 1, and it will iterate up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0**
