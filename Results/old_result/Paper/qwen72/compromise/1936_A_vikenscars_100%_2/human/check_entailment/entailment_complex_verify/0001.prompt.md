You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is the length of the permutation p.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    request = f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}'
    print(request, flush=True)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are specific non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)
    return input()
    #The program returns the string 'request' which is formatted as '? a b c d', where a, b, c, and d are specific non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each less than the length of the permutation `p`. It prints a formatted string `? a b c d` to the console and then returns the user's input as a string. The final state of the program is that the formatted string has been printed, and the function has returned the user's input, which can be any string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
def func_2(n):
    max_item_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
        
        if ans == '<':
            max_item_idx = i
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution.
    pair_idx = max_item_idx
    for i in range(n):
        ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
        
        if ans1 == '<':
            pair_idx = i
        elif ans1 == '=':
            ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
            if ans2 == '>':
                pair_idx = i
        
    #State: `pair_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'. `max_item_idx` remains unchanged.
    print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
    #This is printed: ! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx] (where [max_item_idx] is the unchanged value of `max_item_idx` and [pair_idx] is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^4. It determines two indices, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, based on the results of calls to `func_1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the first loop, and `pair_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'. The function then prints the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format: `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? a b c d \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison.
   - This function is correct and follows the interaction protocol.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that solves the problem.
   - The function first finds the index of the maximum item in the permutation \( p \) by comparing each item with the current maximum item using bitwise OR.
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \), it compares \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_i \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \( i \).

4. **Finding the Pair:**
   - After identifying the maximum item, the function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the best pair.
   - For each index \( i \), it compares \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} \) with \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
   - If the values are equal, it further compares \( p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices \( \text{max_item_idx} \) and \( \text{pair_idx} \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \( n-1 \) times, and the second loop runs \( n \) times.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \( 2n-1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the bitwise OR operation to find the maximum item and then uses further queries to find the pair that maximizes the bitwise XOR operation. The number of queries is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
