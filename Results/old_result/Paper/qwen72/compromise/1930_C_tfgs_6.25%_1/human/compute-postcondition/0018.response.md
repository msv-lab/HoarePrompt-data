Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user such that `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`.
- Since `j` is 0, the value appended to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cnt`, `adv`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
