Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` updates the first element of the list `a` (since `i` is 0) by adding 1 to it. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
