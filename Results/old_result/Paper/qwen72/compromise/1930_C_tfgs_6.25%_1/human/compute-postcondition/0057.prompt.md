Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), `j` is `adv - 1`, and the count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), `j` is `adv - 1`, and the count of `a[0]` in `counter` is decreased by 1. Additionally, the count of `a[1]` in `counter` is now `counter[a[1]] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `counter[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), the values from `a[1] - 1` down to `a[1] - (adv - 1)`, and `a[2]`. `j` is `adv - 1`, and `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]` and must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
