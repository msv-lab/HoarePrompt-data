Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 2 elements, `n` must be greater than `len(a)`, `counter[a[0]]` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `ans` has been appended with the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, and `a[i - 1] - 3`, `adv` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - 3` to the list `ans`.
- The previous values of `a`, `n`, `counter[a[0]]`, `j`, and `adv` remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the new value `a[i - 1] - 3` in addition to the previously appended values `a[i - 1] - 1` and `a[i - 1] - 2`.
