Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the original `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `onum`, `i` is 0, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `cn` is 1, `f` is 1, `ck` is 1, and the current value of `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
