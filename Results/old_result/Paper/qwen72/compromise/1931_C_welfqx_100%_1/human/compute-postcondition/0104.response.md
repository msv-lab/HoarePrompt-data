Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the original `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `onum`, `i` is 2, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `ii` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `f` is 1, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Initially, `cn` could be either 1 or 2 based on the initial state. If `num[i]` was equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` would have been 2, and after the increment, it becomes 3. If `num[i]` was not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` would have been 1, and after the increment, it becomes 2. Since the initial state specifies that `cn` is 1, after the increment, `cn` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
