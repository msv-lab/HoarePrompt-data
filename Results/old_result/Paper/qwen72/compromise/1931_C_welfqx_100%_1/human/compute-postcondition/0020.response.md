Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `r` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0.
   - `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks.
   - Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(0)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer 0.
   - The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not use any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer 0, regardless of the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, and `j`.

Output: **0**
