The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and the loop body has been executed once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and the loop breaks.**
