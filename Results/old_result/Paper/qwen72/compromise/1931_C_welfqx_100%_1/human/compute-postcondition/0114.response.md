The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses and what conditions must be met for it to continue.

1. **Variable `ii`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0. In a `for` loop, the loop variable is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop condition is `ii in range(n - 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `ii` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**.
