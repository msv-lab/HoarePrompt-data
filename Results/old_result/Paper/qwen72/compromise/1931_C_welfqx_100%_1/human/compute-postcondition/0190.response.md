Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ck` is the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. The loop has printed `n - max(cn, ck)` for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains the same as it was initially.
- **`r`**: The loop index `r` has completed all iterations and is now `t - 1`.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is the size of the array, which is an integer greater than 1.
- **`f`**: The flag `f` is set to 1 at the beginning of each test case and is used to check if all elements in `num` are the same.
- **`num`**: This is the list of integers for the current test case.
- **`onum`**: This is a reversed copy of `num`.
- **`symb1`**: The first element of `num`.
- **`symb2`**: The last element of `num`.
- **`cn`**: The count of the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal.
- **`ck`**: The count of the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.
- **`cn + ck`**: If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is incremented by `ck`.
- **Output**: For each test case, the loop prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array either empty or have all elements equal.

This output state reflects the final condition of the variables after the loop has executed all `t` test cases.
