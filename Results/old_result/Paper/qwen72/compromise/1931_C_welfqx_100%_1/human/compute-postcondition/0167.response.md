The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state mentions that `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, and remains 1 otherwise, the output state will depend on the initial value of `cn`. However, the code snippet provided does not include the condition check, so we assume `cn` is already 2. Therefore, `cn` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 2, `cn` is 3.**
