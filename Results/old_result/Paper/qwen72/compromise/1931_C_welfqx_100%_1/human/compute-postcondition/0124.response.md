Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `cn` is `cn + ck`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by `ck`.
- The value of `ii` remains `n - 2`.
- The value of `ck` remains the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal.
- The value of `symb1` remains equal to `symb2`.
- The loop completion status (whether it completed without breaking or broke at a specific index) is not affected by this code snippet.
