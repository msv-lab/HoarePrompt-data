Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the original `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `onum`, `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, or `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `num` that are equal, `f` is 1, `ck` is 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `i` now holds the index where the first pair of consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, or `n - 2` if all elements are equal.
- The variable `cn` holds the count of consecutive elements at the start of `num` that are equal.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `f`, `ck`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
