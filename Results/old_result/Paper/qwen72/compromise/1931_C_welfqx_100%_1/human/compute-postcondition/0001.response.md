The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is already ensured that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, for the loop to start, `r` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0**
