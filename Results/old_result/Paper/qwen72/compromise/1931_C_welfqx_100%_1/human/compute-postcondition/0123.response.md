Postcondition: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements at the start of `onum` that are equal, and the loop has completed without breaking if all elements in `onum` from the start are equal up to the second last element. If the loop breaks, `ii` is the index where `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]` and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start up to `ii`. Additionally, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**
