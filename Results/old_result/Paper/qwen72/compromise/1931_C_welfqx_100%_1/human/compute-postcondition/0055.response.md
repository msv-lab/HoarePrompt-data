To determine the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `n`.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for ii in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of `ii` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop increments `ii` by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given that `ii` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal, `ii` is 2, and `ck` is 2 if the second element of `onum` is equal to the first element of `onum`. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 if the first two elements of `onum` are equal, and the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
