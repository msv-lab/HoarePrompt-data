The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop behavior is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` and the loop breaks. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.
