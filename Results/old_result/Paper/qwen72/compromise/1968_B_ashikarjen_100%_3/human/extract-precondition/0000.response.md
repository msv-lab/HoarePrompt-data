Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to properly handle the input:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
