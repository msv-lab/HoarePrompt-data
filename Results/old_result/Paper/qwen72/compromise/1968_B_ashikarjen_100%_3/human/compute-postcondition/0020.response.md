To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j` (must be less than `m` for the loop to start)
   - `m` (defines the upper limit for `j`)
   - `b[j]` (must not be equal to `a[i]` for the loop to start)
   - `a[i]` (the value to compare against `b[j]`)

2. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 1 (used in the comparison `b[j] != a[i]`)
   - `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]` (not directly relevant to the loop head, but implies `b` and `a` have some values)

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `j < m` must be true.
   - `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to start. If `j` is not less than `m`, the loop will not execute.
   - `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for the loop to start. If `b[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, the loop will not execute.

### Conclusion:
- `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for the loop to execute.

Given that `i` is 1 and `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` must be less than `m`, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`**
