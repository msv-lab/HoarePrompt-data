Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is not less than `m`, `j` remains `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
