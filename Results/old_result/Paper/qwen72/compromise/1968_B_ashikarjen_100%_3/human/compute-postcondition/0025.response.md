Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 3`, `j` must be less than `m - 2`, `b[j + 2]` must not be equal to `a[1]`, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`**

Explanation:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `j + 3` (since `j` was initially `j + 2`).
- The other conditions and variables (`n`, `i`, `b[j + 2]`, and `b[k]`) remain unchanged and still hold their respective constraints.
