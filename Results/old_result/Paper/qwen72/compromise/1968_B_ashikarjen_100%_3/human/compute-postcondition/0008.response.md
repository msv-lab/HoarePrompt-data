The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` also depends on the values of `b[j]` and `a[i]`. However, we can only adjust `j` and `m` according to the task constraints.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and `b[0]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.

Given that `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]` (since `i` is 0).

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `b[1]` must not be equal to `a[0]`**
