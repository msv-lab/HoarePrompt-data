To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

### Current State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`
- If `j` is less than `m`, then `j` is updated to `m + 1` and `k` is increased by 1.
- If `j` is not less than `m`, then `j` remains `m` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `j < m`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `m`. If `j` is not less than `m`, the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than `m`.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
   - Therefore, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]`.

### Adjustments:
- **`j` must be less than `m`**:
  - This is a necessary condition for the loop to execute. If `j` is not less than `m`, the loop will not run.
- **`b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]`**:
  - This is also a necessary condition for the loop to execute. If `b[j]` is equal to `a[2]`, the loop will not run.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 2 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]` (unchanged)
- `j` must be less than `m`
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]`

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b[k]` must not be equal to `a[0]` for all `k` in the range `[0, m-1]`, `j` must be less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[2]`**
