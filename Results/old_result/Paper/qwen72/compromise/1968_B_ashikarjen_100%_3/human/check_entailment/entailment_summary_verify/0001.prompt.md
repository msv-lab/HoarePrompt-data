You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input from the user, consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. The function then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates the number of matches (`k`) between the characters of `a` and `b` by iterating through `a` and finding corresponding characters in `b`. The function prints the number of matches found (`k`) and does not return any value. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the code provided does not include the loop to process these test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` using `input()`.
   - It initializes two variables: `k` to count the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to track the current position in `b`.

3. **Loop to Find the Subsequence:**
   - The program iterates over each character in `a` using a `for` loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the same character in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If it finds the character `a[i]` in `b[j]`, it increments `k` and moves to the next position in `b` by incrementing `j`.
   - If it reaches the end of `b` without finding the character `a[i]`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for finding the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is implemented correctly:
  - It iterates through each character of `a` and tries to find a matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
  - If a match is found, it moves to the next character in `a` and the next position in `b`.
  - If a match is not found, it breaks the loop, ensuring that the prefix length is correctly determined.
- The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `b` does not contain the character '1' (as in the sixth example).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
