### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the program reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` using `input()`.
   - It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - It initializes `j` to 0, which will track the current position in `b`.

3. **Loop to Find the Subsequence:**
   - The program iterates over each character in `a` using a `for` loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the same character in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If it finds the character `a[i]` in `b[j]`, it increments `k` and moves to the next position in `b` by incrementing `j`.
   - If it reaches the end of `b` without finding the character `a[i]`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function should handle the input for each test case, which it does correctly.

- **State of the program inside the function:**
  - `n` and `m` are correctly read as the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively.
  - `a` and `b` are correctly read as binary strings.
  - `k` is initialized to 0, and `j` is initialized to 0.
  - The `for` loop iterates over each character in `a`.
  - The `while` loop correctly finds the next matching character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
  - If a match is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position.
  - If no match is found, the `while` loop breaks, and the `for` loop also breaks, ensuring that the prefix length is correctly determined.
  - The final state of `k` is printed, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- **Example 1:**
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - The prefix "10" is a subsequence of `b`, but "100" is not.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Example 6:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - `b` does not contain the character '1', so the program correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The logic for finding the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is implemented correctly, and it handles edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
