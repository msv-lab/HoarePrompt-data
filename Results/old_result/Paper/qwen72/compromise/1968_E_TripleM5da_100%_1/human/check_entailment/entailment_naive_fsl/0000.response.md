Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always prints the first two points as \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then prints the remaining points as \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not guarantee that the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-2| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) can achieve a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 6, as shown in the problem description:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6.

Thus, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and is therefore incorrect.
