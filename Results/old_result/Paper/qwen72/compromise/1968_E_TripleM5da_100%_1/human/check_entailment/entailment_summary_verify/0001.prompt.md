You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3. The function then prints a series of pairs of integers: (1, 1), (1, 2), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n` inclusive, it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value, but it affects the program state by consuming input and producing output for each test case. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `n` for each test case are processed, and the corresponding pairs are printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints `n` points.
   - The points are printed as follows:
     - The first point is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second point is always \((1, 2)\).
     - For the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
     - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4.
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 6, but the program only generates 5 distinct distances.
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is 9, but the program only generates 8 distinct distances.
   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) is 11, but the program only generates 10 distinct distances.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\).
   - Specifically, for \(n \geq 4\), the program fails to generate the maximum number of distinct distances.
