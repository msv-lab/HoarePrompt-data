### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints `n` points.
   - The points are printed as follows:
     - The first point is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second point is always \((1, 2)\).
     - For the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
     - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4.
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 6, but the program only generates 5 distinct distances.
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is 9, but the program only generates 8 distinct distances.
   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\).
     - This is incorrect because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) is 11, but the program only generates 10 distinct distances.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\).
   - Specifically, for \(n \geq 4\), the program fails to generate the maximum number of distinct distances.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\), particularly for \(n \geq 4\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
