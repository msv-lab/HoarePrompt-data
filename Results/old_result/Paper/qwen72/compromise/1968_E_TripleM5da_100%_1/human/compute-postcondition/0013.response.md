Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\). This means `n` can be any integer from 3 to 1000.
  - `i` is set to `n`.
  - `n` is then updated to an input integer greater than or equal to the previous value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(1, 1)`.
- This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will always print the integers 1 and 1, separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integers 1 and 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

Output: **1 1**
