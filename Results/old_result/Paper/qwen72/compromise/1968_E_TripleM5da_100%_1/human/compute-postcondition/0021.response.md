Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, which is the upper limit of the loop's range. The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 50, and `n` remains an integer within the range 3 to 10^3, as these values are not modified by the loop. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
