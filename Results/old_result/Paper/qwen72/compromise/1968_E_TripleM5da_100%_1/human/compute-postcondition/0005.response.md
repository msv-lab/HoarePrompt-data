The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3. However, the variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is set to 0, the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **0, 0**
