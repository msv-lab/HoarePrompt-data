Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer (which must be greater than 0).**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must be greater than 0.
- The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code.
- The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 is still valid after the code execution, assuming the input adheres to this constraint.
