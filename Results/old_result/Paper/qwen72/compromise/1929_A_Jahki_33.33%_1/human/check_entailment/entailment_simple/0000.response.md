Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array itself. It ensures that the array is a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is in non-decreasing order (`order == 0`), it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the array is already in non-decreasing order, and the beauty of the array is the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which will be zero if the array is constant.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the `func_1` function:
- The function `func_1` is checking if the array is in non-decreasing order, but it should actually check if the array is constant (i.e., all elements are the same). This is because if all elements are the same, the beauty will be zero regardless of the order.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should check if all elements in the array are the same, not just if the array is in non-decreasing order.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, num2):
    # Check if all elements in the array are the same
    if len(set(a)) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct output for arrays where all elements are the same but not in non-decreasing order.

**Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where all elements in the array are the same correctly. It should check if all elements are the same, not just if the array is in non-decreasing order.
