The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `num2`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 2 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a value between 1 and 500.

The function returns `True` in Case_1 and `False` in Case_2. However, the specific conditions under which each case is triggered are not provided in the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `num2`. It returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case, but the specific conditions for each return value are not specified.**
