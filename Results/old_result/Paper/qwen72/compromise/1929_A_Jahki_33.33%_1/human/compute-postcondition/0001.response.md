The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num2`. For the loop to execute, `num2` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `num2 - 1`. The variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500 and `num2` must be greater than 1, `order` is 0, `i` is 1**
