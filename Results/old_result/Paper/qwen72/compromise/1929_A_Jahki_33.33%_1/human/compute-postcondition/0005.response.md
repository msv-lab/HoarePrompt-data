The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `num2`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `num2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num2` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `num2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500 and `num2` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` is 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.**
