Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string, sorts the characters based on the prefix balance and position as specified, and constructs the resulting string. The program handles the input constraints and produces the correct output for all potential cases, including edge cases like a single character or a string with equal numbers of opening and closing parentheses. Therefore, the program is correct.
