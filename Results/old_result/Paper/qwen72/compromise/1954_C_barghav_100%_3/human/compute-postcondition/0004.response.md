Output State: **The lists `a` and `b` will be modified such that for the first position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ, if `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, the values at that position will be swapped. After the first swap or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position, the values will be swapped for all subsequent positions where `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. The flag `f` will be set to 1 if any swap occurs or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any position. The variable `t` remains unchanged.**
