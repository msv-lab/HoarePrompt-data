The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts does not directly affect the loop's execution, but the input will determine how many times the loop runs.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5

The loop will execute based on the input, which must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be a positive integer, we can assume that the input will be `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input must be a positive integer (which is `t`)**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required by the problem statement.
