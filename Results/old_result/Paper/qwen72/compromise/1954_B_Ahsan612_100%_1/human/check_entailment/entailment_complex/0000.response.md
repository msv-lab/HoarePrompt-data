Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Consecutive Identical Elements:**
   - The program uses a variable `same` to count consecutive identical elements and a variable `minn` to track the minimum length of such sequences.
   - However, the logic for updating `num` and `same` is flawed. The program increments `i` and then assigns `num = ar[i]` without checking if `i` is out of bounds. This can lead to an `IndexError` if `i` is already at the last index of the array.
   - Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array has only one unique element. It should print `-1` if the array is entirely composed of the same element, but the current logic may not always detect this correctly.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly prints `-1` if the array consists of all identical elements or if the array is empty (though the problem guarantees that the array is not empty).
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it should print `-1` because it is already not beautiful, but the current logic may not detect this.

### Correct Approach:
- To determine the minimum number of elements to remove, the program should:
  - Identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
  - If the array consists entirely of the same element, print `-1`.
  - Otherwise, print the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements, as removing any element from this sequence will prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

#State: The loop processes each test case and prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array `ar` for each test case. If the array consists of all identical elements or is empty, it prints `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case.
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Edge Case Handling:** If `n == 1`, the array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so we print `-1` and continue to the next test case.
- **Consecutive Identical Elements:** We iterate through the array and count the length of consecutive identical elements. If we encounter a different element, we update `minn` with the minimum length of the consecutive identical elements found so far.
- **Final Check:** After the loop, we update `minn` with the length of the last sequence of consecutive identical elements. If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to `n`, it means the array is entirely composed of the same element, so we print `-1`. Otherwise, we print `minn`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is **incorrect** due to the flawed logic for updating `num` and `same`, and the lack of proper handling for edge cases. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
