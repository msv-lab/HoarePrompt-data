The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
