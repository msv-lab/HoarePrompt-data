Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`sum`**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `sum` will be \( n^3 \). This is because the loop effectively accumulates the cubes of integers from 2 to `n`.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be `n` + 1 after the loop has completed all its iterations. This is because the loop increments `i` from 2 to `n`, and the final value of `i` will be `n` + 1.
- **`j`**: The value of `j` remains unchanged as `n` throughout the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once. This condition remains true after the loop has finished executing.
