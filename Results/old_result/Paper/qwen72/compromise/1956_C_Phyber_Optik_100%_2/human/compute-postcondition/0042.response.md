Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `sum`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial values. Specifically, `t` must still be greater than 0, `sum` is still \( n^3 \), and `i` is still `n` + 1. The variable `j` will have reached the value `n` because the loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains true, as it was a requirement for the loop to execute at all.
