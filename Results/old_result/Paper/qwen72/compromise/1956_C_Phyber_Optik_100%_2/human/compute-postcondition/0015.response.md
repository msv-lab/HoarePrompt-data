The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + (2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 + (3 * 3 - 2 * 2) * 3 + ... + (n * n - (n - 1) * (n - 1)) * n, `i` is n + 1, `j` is 2**
