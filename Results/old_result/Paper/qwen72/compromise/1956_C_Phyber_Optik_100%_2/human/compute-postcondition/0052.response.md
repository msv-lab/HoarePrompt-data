Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n` + 1, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `t` is `t` - 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 0**: This condition remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- **`sum` is \( n^3 \)**: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `sum` will be \( n^3 \). This is because the loop accumulates the sum of cubes of integers from 2 to `n`.
- **`i` is `n` + 1**: The loop variable `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` + 1.
- **`j` is `n`**: The variable `j` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n`.
- **`n` must be at least 2**: This condition ensures that the loop runs at least once.
- **`t` is `t` - 1**: The value of `t` is decremented by 1 after the loop completes, as specified in the initial state.
