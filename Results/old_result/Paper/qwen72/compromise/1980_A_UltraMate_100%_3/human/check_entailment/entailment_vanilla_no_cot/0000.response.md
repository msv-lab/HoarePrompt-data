Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Problem Counting**: For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Frequency Counting**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. **Initial Calculation**: It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
5. **Check for Missing Problems**: It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. If a difficulty level is not present in the problem bank (`hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` problems of that difficulty are needed.
6. **Check for Insufficient Problems**: For each difficulty level that is present in the problem bank, it checks if the number of problems of that difficulty is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
