### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is an efficient way to keep track of how many problems of each difficulty level are available.

3. **Initial Check for Missing Problems**: The program iterates over the string `p` which contains all the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G'). For each difficulty level, it checks if it is not present in the `Counter` object `hmp`. If a difficulty level is missing, it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because `m` rounds need to be held, and each round requires one problem of each difficulty level.

4. **Check for Insufficient Problems**: After the initial check, the program iterates over the `Counter` object `hmp` to check if the frequency of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans` to account for the additional problems needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

5. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of problems that need to be created to hold `m` rounds.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F'
  - Additional problems needed: `2` (one for 'A' and one for 'F')
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A', 'F'
  - Additional problems needed for missing difficulties: `2 * 2 = 4`
  - Additional problems needed for insufficient difficulties: `1` (for 'G')
  - Total additional problems needed: `4 + 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
  - `hmp` will be: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
  - Missing difficulties: 'A'
  - Additional problems needed: `1` (one for 'A')
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the problem requirements, and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
