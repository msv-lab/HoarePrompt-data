Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least two keys, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `ans` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m` plus `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`.
- The value of `hmp[i]` is the frequency of the second key in `hmp`.
- If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is increased by the difference `m - hmp[i]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
