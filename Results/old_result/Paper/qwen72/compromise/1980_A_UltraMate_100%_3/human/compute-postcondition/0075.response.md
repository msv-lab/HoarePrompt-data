Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'A' is not in `s`, `ans` is set to `m`. If 'A' is in `s` and `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m` added to its previous value (which was 0 if 'A' was in `s`). If 'A' is in `s` and `i` is in `hmp`, `ans` remains 0.***
