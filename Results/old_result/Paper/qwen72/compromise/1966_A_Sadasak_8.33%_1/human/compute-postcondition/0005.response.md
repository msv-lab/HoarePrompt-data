Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, capped at a maximum of `k`. The original list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged. **
