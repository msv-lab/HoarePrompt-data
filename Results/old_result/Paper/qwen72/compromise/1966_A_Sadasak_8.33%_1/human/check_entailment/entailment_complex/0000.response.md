### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because it is impossible to perform any exchange operation with fewer cards than required.
   - If `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards for `k - 1` cards, leaving you with `k - 1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` and caps it at `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k`, which is a valid operation since you can only exchange up to `k` cards at a time.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k` in the `frequency_table`. If so, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform one exchange operation to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `n`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchange operations.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final Output**: The program does not correctly handle the case where no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`. Instead of printing `n`, it should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchange operations. This can be done by summing the frequencies of all card numbers and then applying the exchange operation logic.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, calculate the total number of cards that can be exchanged. This can be done by summing the frequencies of all card numbers and then dividing by `k` to determine how many full exchanges can be made. The remainder will give the number of cards left after all possible exchanges.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it fails to handle the general case where the frequencies of card numbers are not exactly `k`.

### Correctness: **False**
