Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each card number in the hand, but it caps the frequency at `k`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a card number appears more than `k` times, the program should consider the actual frequency to determine the optimal number of cards to exchange.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly outputs `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, the program outputs `k - 1`, which is correct because you can exchange all `k` cards for `k - 1` cards.
   - If `k < n`, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it outputs `k - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations, which involves more complex logic than just checking if `k` is in the frequency values.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be exchanged. For each card number, if the frequency is a multiple of `k`, you can exchange all those cards for `k - 1` cards each time. If the frequency is not a multiple of `k`, you will have some cards left over.
   - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders when each frequency is divided by `k`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
