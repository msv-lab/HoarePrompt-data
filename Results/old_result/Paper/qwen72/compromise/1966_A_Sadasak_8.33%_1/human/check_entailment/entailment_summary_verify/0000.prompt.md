You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    5 3
    
    4 1 1 4 4
    
    1 10
    
    7
    
    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, capped at a maximum of `k`. The original list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the operations is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
The program incorrectly prints `5` instead of `2` for this test case. The issue lies in the logic within the `else` block where it prints `n` when none of the frequencies match `k`. This does not account for the possibility of performing the operation to reduce the number of cards further.

The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` cards with the same number, and then applying the exchange operation to minimize the remaining cards. The current implementation does not properly handle this logic.
