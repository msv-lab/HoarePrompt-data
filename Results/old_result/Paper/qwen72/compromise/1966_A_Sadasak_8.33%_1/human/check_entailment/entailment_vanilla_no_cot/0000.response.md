Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequencies of each card number, but it limits the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency of a card number can be more than `k`, and this information is crucial for determining the minimum number of cards left.

2. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not the correct approach. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

3. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal solution involves grouping cards by their numbers and performing the operations to minimize the number of cards left. The program does not implement this logic correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = n
        for count in freq.values():
            if count >= k:
                min_cards_left -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the frequency of each card number without limiting it to `k`.

2. **Minimum Cards Left Calculation**: The main logic calculates the minimum number of cards left by iterating over the frequency table. For each card number with a frequency of `count`:
   - If `count` is at least `k`, we can perform the operation `count // k` times, each time reducing the number of cards by `k - 1`.
   - The total reduction in the number of cards is `(count // k) * (k - 1)`.
   - We subtract this reduction from the total number of cards `n` to get the minimum number of cards left.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
