Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged after the loop completes.**
