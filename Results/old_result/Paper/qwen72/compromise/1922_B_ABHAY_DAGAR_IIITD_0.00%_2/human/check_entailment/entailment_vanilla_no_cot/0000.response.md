Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of determining the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given list of stick lengths (each a power of 2) to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program handles multiple test cases and correctly counts the combinations of sticks that can form such triangles.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and pair them with any of the previously counted sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies by the total count of previously counted sticks.
4. **Summing Up Results**: It sums up all valid combinations and appends the result to the `results` list.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This logic ensures that the program correctly counts the number of valid combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
