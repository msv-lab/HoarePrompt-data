### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a correct approach to efficiently count the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the counts of each stick length and calculates the number of ways to form triangles.
   - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length (`cnt >= 3`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length. This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length (`cnt >= 2`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length and one stick from the previously counted sticks (`total_count`). This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \) multiplied by the number of previously counted sticks.
   - **Updating Total Count:**
     - The program correctly updates `total_count` with the count of the current stick length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length.
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths: 8, 4, 2, 8
  - Possible triangles: (8, 4, 8) and (8, 2, 8)
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: 2
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths: 2, 4, 8
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick.
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:

- **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
  - The program implicitly handles the non-degenerate triangle condition by ensuring that the stick lengths are powers of 2. For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if at least two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is either the same length or a smaller length (since \(2^a + 2^a > 2^b\) for \(a \geq b\)).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when there are fewer than 3 sticks or when all sticks have different lengths.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the stick lengths, and calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles. The logic and formulas used are correct and match the problem requirements. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
