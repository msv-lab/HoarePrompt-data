The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` (4 <= n <= 10^9) and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n` with prime factors as keys and their multiplicities as values. If `n` is 1, `d` is an empty dictionary. If `n` is a prime number, `d` contains a single entry with `n` as the key and 1 as the value. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and does not have any side effects.
