The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) that can be formed from the elements of `arr`. The input list `arr` remains unchanged after the function call. The returned value is the length of the LIS, which is a subsequence where the elements are in strictly increasing order.
