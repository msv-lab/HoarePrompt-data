The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be added (0 <= m <= n). It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` inner lists. Each inner list at index `x` and `y` (for each pair returned by `func_1()`) is appended with the corresponding `y` or `x` value, respectively. After the function concludes, the list `l` will have `n + 1` inner lists, and each of these inner lists will contain elements that represent the connections (edges) added between the vertices of the polygon. The final state of the program is that `l` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index.
