The function `imap` is intended to read multiple integers from input, but the specific details of the input format and the relationship between the input variables are not provided in the function definition. However, based on the problem description, it is expected that the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with a set of integers representing the number of sides of the polygon (n), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x), the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y, which is 0 in this version), and the vertices Bessie has chosen.
