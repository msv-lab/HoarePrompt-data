Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If neither of these conditions is met, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 3`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[i]`. `i` and `j` must both be greater than 0.**
