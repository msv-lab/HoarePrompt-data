Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was previously at the left end of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed. `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `vis[ver]` is 1, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the right of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.***
