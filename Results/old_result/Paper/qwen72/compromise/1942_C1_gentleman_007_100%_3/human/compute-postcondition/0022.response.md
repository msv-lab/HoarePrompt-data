Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` has one less element than before.
- `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation.
- All nodes in `q` are still marked as visited in the `vis` list.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(ver, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `ver`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Since `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, it will be the value that was removed from `q`. The exact value of `ver` is not specified, but it is known to be the front element of `q` before the operation.

### Output:
**ver (where ver is the element that was at the front of q before the operation) **

This means the output will be the value of `ver`, followed by a space.
