Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(b)`. `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, and `l` is an empty list. If neither of these conditions is met, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, and `l` is an empty list. If neither of these conditions is met, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[i]`. `i` and `j` must both be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 3`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` in the else part, then `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(b) - 2`, and `l` is an empty list. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` in the else part, then `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[len(a)]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` in the else part, then `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[len(a) - 1]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` in the else part, then `i` is `len(a) - 3`, `j` is `len(b) - 4`, and `l` is a list containing the last element of `a` and `a[i]`. `i` and `j` must both be greater than 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
