The loop condition is based on the length of the deque `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, the deque `q` must not be empty. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has finished executing, which implies that `q` was empty at that point.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `q` so that it is not empty. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only checks the length of `q`, we can simply state that `q` must have at least one element.

State: **`q` has at least one element, `ver` is the last node processed from `q`, and all nodes in `q` are marked as visited in the `vis` list.**
