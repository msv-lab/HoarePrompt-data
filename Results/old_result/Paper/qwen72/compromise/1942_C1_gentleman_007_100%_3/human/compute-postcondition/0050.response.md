Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `node` has been visited (`vis[node]` is `True`) and `node` is appended to `q`, so `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list. Otherwise, `node` remains unvisited and is not appended to `q`.** 

The code snippet `q.append(node)` appends `node` to the list `q`, regardless of whether `node` has been visited or not. Therefore, the output state is updated to reflect that `node` is now at the end of `q`. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
