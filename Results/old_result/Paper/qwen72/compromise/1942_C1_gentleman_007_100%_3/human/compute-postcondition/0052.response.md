Postcondition: ***`graph[ver]` must contain at least 3 elements, and `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is `False`, `vis[node]` is updated to `True`, `node` has been visited, and `node` is appended to `q`, so `q` now contains `node` at the end of its list. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains `False`, `node` remains unvisited, and `node` is not appended to `q`.***
