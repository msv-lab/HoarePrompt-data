The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `q`. If `q` has elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` has no elements left. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must have at least one element.

State: **`q` must have at least one element, `ver` is the last element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, and all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list**
