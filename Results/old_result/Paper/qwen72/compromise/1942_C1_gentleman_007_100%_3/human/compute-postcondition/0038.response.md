Output State: **`q` has one fewer element at the front, `ver` is now the element that was second in `q` before the operation, all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are now marked as visited in the `vis` list.**

Explanation: The `popleft()` method removes the element at the front of the queue `q` and assigns it to `ver`. Since `ver` was previously the last element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, after the operation, `ver` is now the element that was second in `q` before the operation. The state of the `vis` list remains unchanged, as all nodes that were in `q` initially and their neighbors (that were not already visited) are still marked as visited.
