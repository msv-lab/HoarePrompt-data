You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty.
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). For each `i` from 1 to `len(a)`, and for each `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(b)`.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and both lists are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list of size `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0 except for the elements in the last row (index `len(a)`) and the last column (index `len(b)`). `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the string `s` in reverse order, where `s` is formed by concatenating the elements of list `l` (which contains the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table) converted to strings.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two non-empty lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a string that is the reverse of the concatenated elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` in reverse order, where `s` is formed by concatenating the elements of list `l` (which contains the elements of `a` that contribute to the common subsequence between `a` and `b` as determined by the `dp` table) converted to strings.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
