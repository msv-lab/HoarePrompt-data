The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first traversal starting from the given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It marks all reachable vertices from `ver` as visited in the `vis` list and prints each visited vertex. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `vis` list will have been updated to mark all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited, and the `q` deque will be empty.
