The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If no such divisor exists, it returns 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, or 1 if no such divisor exists.**
