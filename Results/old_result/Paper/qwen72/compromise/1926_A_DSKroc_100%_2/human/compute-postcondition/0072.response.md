Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `ac` is the total number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the total number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is less than or equal to the number of non-'A' characters.***
