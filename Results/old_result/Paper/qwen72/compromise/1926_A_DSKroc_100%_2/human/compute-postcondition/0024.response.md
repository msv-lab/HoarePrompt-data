Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.***
