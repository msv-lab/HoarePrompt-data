Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. **
