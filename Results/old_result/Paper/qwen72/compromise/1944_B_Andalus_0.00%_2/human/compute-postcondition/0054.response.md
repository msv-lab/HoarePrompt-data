Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. `sz` is 2.** 

The code snippet `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. Since the initial state specifies that `sz` remains 0 if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and otherwise `sz` remains 0, the only way this code can execute is if `sz` was initially 0 and less than `k`. Therefore, after executing `sz += 2`, the value of `sz` becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
