Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 1 element, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `i`, `rdb`, `sz`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
