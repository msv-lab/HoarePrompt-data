Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` if `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the values of `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.***
