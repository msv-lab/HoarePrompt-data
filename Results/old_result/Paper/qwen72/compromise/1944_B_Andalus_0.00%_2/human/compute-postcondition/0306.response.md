Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 1, and `sng` must have at least 1 element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
