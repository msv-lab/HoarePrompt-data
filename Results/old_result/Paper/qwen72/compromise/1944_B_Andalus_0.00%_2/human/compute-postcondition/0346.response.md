Output State: **`sz` is `sz + 1`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 1 element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is exited.** 

The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, but the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The loop or if statement will exit if `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
