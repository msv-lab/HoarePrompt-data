Output State: **The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `sz` is the total number of elements printed from `ldb` and `sng` in the first half of the loop and from `rdb` and `sng` in the second half of the loop, which is `min(k, 2 * len(ldb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(ldb))) + min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`. `ldb` and `rdb` contain all elements that appeared consecutively in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next elements, and the same for `rgt`. The elements in `sng` that were printed are no longer in `sng`. The elements in `ldb` and `rdb` that were printed are no longer in `ldb` and `rdb`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all `T` iterations is as follows:
- The loop has run for the specified number of times `T`.
- The variable `sz` represents the total number of elements printed from the lists `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` during the entire execution of the loop.
- `ldb` contains all elements that appeared consecutively in the sorted left half of the list `lft`.
- `rdb` contains all elements that appeared consecutively in the sorted right half of the list `rgt`.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next elements, and the same for `rgt`.
- The elements that were printed from `sng` are no longer in `sng`.
- The elements that were printed from `ldb` and `rdb` are no longer in `ldb` and `rdb`, respectively.
