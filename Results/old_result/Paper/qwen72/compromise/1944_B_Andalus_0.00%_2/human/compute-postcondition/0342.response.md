Postcondition: **`sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed in `rdb`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 1 element, and the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
