Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` has `rgt[1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` has `rgt[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` has `rgt[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
