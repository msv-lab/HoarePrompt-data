Output State: **`rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, but the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The condition `k - sz` is still greater than or equal to 0, and the condition to break out of the loop or if statement is still checked based on the updated value of `sz`.
