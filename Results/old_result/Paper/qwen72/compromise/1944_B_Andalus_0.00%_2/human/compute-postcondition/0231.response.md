To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the precondition:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 2 elements
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 1
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`
   - `sng` is a list that contains elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element, and must have at least 2 elements

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `sng`.
   - Since `sng` is defined as a list containing elements from `lft` that meet specific conditions (not equal to their previous or next elements and having at least 2 elements), the second element of `sng` is a specific value from `lft`.

4. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `elem` depends on the contents of `lft` and the conditions that define `sng`.
   - However, based on the precondition, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng, and sng contains elements from lft that are not equal to their previous or next elements and has at least 2 elements)**
