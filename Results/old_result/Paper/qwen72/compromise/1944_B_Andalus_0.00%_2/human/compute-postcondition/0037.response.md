The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` is a list that now contains the value of `rgt[1]` and the value of `rgt[2]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains a list that contains the value of `rgt[1]`.**
