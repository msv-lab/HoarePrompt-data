To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `elem` and `sng`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Objects:**
   - The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.
   - The objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `sng` to iterate over.
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.
   - Since `elem` is the second element in `sng` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element will be the third element in `sng`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements (since the next `elem` will be the third element).

### Adjusted State:
- `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.
- `sng` must have at least 3 elements.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
