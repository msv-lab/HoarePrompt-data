Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that appear consecutively (i.e., `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n), `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that do not appear consecutively and are not the last element of `lft` (i.e., `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n - 1), `i` is n - 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all the iterations:
- The variable `a` remains a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- The variable `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
- The variable `T` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- The variable `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that appear consecutively (i.e., `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n).
- The variable `rdb` remains an empty list.
- The variable `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that do not appear consecutively and are not the last element of `lft` (i.e., `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` for 1 ≤ i < n - 1).
- The loop index `i` is n - 1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
