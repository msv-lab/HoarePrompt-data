Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least two elements
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `lst` is unchanged
   - `lft` is unchanged
   - `rgt` is unchanged
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`
   - `_` is `T`
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list that contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least two elements.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and the print statement prints `elem` twice followed by a space, the output will be:
     - `elem elem `

5. **Final Answer:**
   Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in the list ldb)**
