Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0 and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
