Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list, `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`.***
