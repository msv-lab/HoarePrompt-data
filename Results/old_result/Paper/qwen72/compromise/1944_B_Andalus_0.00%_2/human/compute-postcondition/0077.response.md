Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng`.
   - The `print` statement will print `elem` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but we know it is the next element in `sng`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the iterable `sng`)**
