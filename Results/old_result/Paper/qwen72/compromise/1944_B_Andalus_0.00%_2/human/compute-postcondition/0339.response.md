Postcondition: ***`rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this update, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.***
