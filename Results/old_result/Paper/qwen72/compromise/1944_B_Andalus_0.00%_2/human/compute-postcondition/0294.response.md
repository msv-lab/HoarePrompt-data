The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `ldb` must have at least one element
- `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`)
- `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `lst` is a list of integers read from input
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order
- `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order
- `elem` is the second element in `ldb`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `ldb` must have at least two elements (since `elem` is the second element in `ldb` and we need to move to the next element)
- `elem` will be the third element in `ldb` (if `ldb` has at least three elements)

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` must have at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`), `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`**
