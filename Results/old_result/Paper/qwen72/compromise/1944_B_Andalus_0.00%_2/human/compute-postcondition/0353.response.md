Output State: **`sz` is `sz + 2`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The values of `sz`, `elem`, and the conditions related to `rdb`, `k`, and `sng` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is broken out of.
