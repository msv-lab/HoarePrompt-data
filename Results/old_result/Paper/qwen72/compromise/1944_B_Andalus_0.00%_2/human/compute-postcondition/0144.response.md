Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ldb` contains the element at index 3 of `lft`, `sng` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index 3 of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Since the initial state specifies that if `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 3 of `lft`, this condition is met, and the element at index 3 of `lft` is appended to `ldb`. The other conditions and the state of `sng` remain unchanged.
