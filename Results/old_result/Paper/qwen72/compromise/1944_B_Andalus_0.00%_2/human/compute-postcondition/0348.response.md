Output State: **`sz` is `sz + 1`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `sz`, `elem`, `rdb`, `k`, and `sng` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement that the `break` statement is inside is exited.
