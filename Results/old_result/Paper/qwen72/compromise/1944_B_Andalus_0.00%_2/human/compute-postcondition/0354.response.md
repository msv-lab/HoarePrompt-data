Postcondition: ***`sz` is `sz + 2`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.***
