To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

4. **Condition for Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
