To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`i`**: `i` is defined as `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer.
2. **`n`**: `n` is an input integer.
3. **`k`**: `k` is an input integer.
4. **`ldb`**: `ldb` is a list that must have at least one element.
5. **`sng`**: `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).
6. **`sz`**: `sz` is 0.
7. **`_`**: `_` is `T + 1`, where `T` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
8. **`rdb`**: `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
9. **`lst`**: `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
10. **`lft`**: `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
11. **`rgt`**: `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.
12. **`elem`**: `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.
13. **`k - sz`**: The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

- **`elem`**: This is the first element in the list `ldb`. Since `ldb` is guaranteed to have at least one element, `elem` will be a valid value.
- **`end=' '`**: This specifies that the print statement will end with a space instead of a newline.

The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem **

Where `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.
