The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` if `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` remains an empty list. `sng` is a list containing the value of `lft[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list. `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.**
