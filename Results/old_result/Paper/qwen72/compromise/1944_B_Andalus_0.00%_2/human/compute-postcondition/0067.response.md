To determine what will be printed when the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the context in which this statement is placed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of some list (not explicitly mentioned, but likely `rdb` or `sng`).
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Context of the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is likely inside a loop that iterates over the elements of `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the elements are printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, the `print` statement will print each element of `sng` followed by a space.
   - The exact elements of `sng` are not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `sng`.

Given the initial state and the context, the `print` statement will print the elements of `sng` separated by spaces. The loop will continue to print elements until the condition `sz >= k` is met, but since the exact values of `sng`, `k`, and `sz` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **[elem1] [elem2] [elem3] ... (where [elem1], [elem2], [elem3], etc., are the elements of the non-empty iterable `sng`)**
