Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed in `rdb`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished. `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is `sz + 1`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 1 element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is `sz + 2`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is `sz + 3`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - (sz + 3)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
