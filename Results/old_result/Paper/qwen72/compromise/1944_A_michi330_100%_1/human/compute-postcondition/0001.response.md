The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
