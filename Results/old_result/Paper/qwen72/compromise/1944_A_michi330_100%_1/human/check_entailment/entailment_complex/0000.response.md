### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `n` islands, and every pair of islands is connected by a bridge, resulting in \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any island that is still connected to island 1 through a series of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
   - If false, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all islands).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 correctly, as it will print `n` (Everule can visit all islands).
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) correctly, as it will print `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the input in the correct format and processes it as described.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the number of bridges Dominater can destroy. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
