### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This is because if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, he can isolate island 1 from all other islands, making it the only reachable island.
   - If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n`. This is because if Dominater can destroy fewer than `n - 1` bridges, there will always be a way for Everule to reach all islands, as the remaining bridges will still form a connected graph.

3. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correct based on the logic described above.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `k` is 0 (no bridges destroyed) and `k` is the maximum possible value (`n(n-1)/2`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function will always print `1` because there are no other islands to visit.
   - For `k = 0`, the function will always print `n` because no bridges are destroyed.
   - For `k >= n - 1`, the function will always print `1` because Everule can be isolated from all other islands.

5. **Loop and Variable Management**:
   - The loop correctly processes `t` test cases.
   - The variables `n` and `k` are re-assigned in each iteration, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic. It correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
