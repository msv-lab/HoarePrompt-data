Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `q` is equal to `+`.** 

The value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
