Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a new input integer greater than 1.
   - `e` is a new input string.
   - `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(P - M)`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the count of all other characters in the string `e` (i.e., characters that are not '+').

4. **Calculate the Output:**
   - The expression `P - M` will subtract the number of non '+' characters from the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.

Since the exact string `e` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `P - M`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **P - M (where P is the number of '+' characters in the string `e` and M is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+')**
