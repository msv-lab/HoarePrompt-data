Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0.**

The code snippet `M = 0` resets the variable `M` to 0, overriding its previous value, which was the number of characters in the new `e` that are not `+`. The other variables remain unchanged.
