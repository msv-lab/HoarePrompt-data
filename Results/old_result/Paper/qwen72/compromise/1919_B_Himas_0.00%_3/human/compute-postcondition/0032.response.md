The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e` and the current character `q`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `s` is an input integer greater than 0
- `e` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character
- `q` is the first character of `e`
- If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `e` must have at least 2 characters. The variable `q` will be the second character of `e` in the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
