You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input integer greater than 0, `e` is the last input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the last input string, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the last input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to split a string `s` of '+' and '-' characters into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The elements of the array are 1 for '+' and -1 for '-'.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` for the number of '+' characters and `M` for the number of '-' characters.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - However, the problem requires the minimum possible penalty, not just the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.
   - The penalty calculation for a subarray is \( |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \), where \( c_i \) is the value of the character (1 for '+' and -1 for '-').
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of 0 if possible. If not, the subarrays should be as small as possible to minimize the penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the subarrays as much as possible.
   - If the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, the optimal split would be to pair each '+' with a '-' to form subarrays with a sum of 0, resulting in a total penalty of 0.
   - If the string has an unequal number of '+' and '-' characters, the optimal split would be to form subarrays of length 1 for the remaining characters, each contributing a penalty of 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. It simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
