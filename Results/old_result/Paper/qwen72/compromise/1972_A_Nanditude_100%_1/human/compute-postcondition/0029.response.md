The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `j` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state, `n` is the input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
