To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for the corresponding `i` values.
   - `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are not less than `a[i]` up to the last iteration.

2. **Understanding `cnt` and `i`:**
   - `cnt` is a counter that keeps track of how many elements in `b` are less than the corresponding elements in `a` at each index `i`.
   - `i` is another counter that keeps track of how many elements in `b` are not less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the last iteration.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` at each index `i`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the given information, we know that `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`)**
