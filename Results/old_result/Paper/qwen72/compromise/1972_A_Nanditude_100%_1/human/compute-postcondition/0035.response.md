The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `cnt` is either 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, or 0 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`. `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, or 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`. `j` is 1.**
