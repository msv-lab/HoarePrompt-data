The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 2. If `b[0]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 0. If `b[0]` is not less than `a[i]` and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. If `b[0]` is not less than `a[i]` and `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
