The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` is not initialized before the loop and will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `j` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
