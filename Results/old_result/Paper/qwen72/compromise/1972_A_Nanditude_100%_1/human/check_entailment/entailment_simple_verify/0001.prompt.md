You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than `a[i]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` for each iteration, `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to `j = n-1` for each iteration, and `j` is `n-1` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sorted arrays `a` and `b` of length `n`.
   - The goal is to ensure that for all `i`, `a[i] <= b[i]`.
   - We can achieve this by proposing new problems with difficulty `w` and then removing the most difficult problem from `a` after sorting.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero, which will keep track of the number of new problems needed.
   - It uses a pointer `i` to iterate through the array `a`.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program iterates through the array `b` using a loop with index `j`.
   - For each element `b[j]` in `b`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than the current element `a[i]` in `a`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult, so it increments the counter `cnt`.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is acceptable, so it moves the pointer `i` to the next element in `a`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of problems in `a` that are more difficult than the corresponding problems in `b`.
   - However, it does not actually simulate the process of inserting new problems and removing the most difficult one. Instead, it counts the number of problems in `a` that are too difficult and assumes that each such problem can be fixed by proposing a new problem.
   - This approach is correct because each time a new problem is proposed, the most difficult problem in `a` is removed, and the array is sorted. Therefore, the number of problems that need to be fixed is equal to the number of new problems needed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (i.e., `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`).
   - It also handles the case where `a` is entirely more difficult than `b` (i.e., all elements in `a` are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of new problems needed to ensure `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
   - The logic and implementation are sound and meet the problem requirements.
