Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of new problems needed is flawed. The program only increments the count when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does not properly account for the fact that inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one can change the order of the elements in `a`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

The program incorrectly counts 4 new problems instead of 2. The correct logic should involve a more detailed approach to ensure that the difficulties in `a` are adjusted correctly after each insertion and removal operation.
