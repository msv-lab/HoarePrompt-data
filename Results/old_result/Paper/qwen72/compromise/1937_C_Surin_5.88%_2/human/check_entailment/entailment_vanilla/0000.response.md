### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value Index:**
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query to compare `(p_v1 | p_v1)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` always holds the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Value Index:**
   - After finding the index `v1` of the maximum value, the program initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` again.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query to compare `(p_v1 | p_i)` with `(p_v1 | p_prev)`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` holds the index of the second maximum value in the permutation.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The program uses at most `2n` queries in total (one for each element in the first loop and one for each element in the second loop), which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. The logic and steps are sound and align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
