Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It uses the allowed queries to determine the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables and reads the number of test cases.
2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - It starts by finding the index `v1` of the element in the permutation that is likely to be the largest when compared using the bitwise OR operation. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum (`v1`) and updating `v1` if a larger element is found.
3. **Finding the Second Element**:
   - After identifying `v1`, it then finds another index `prev` such that the XOR of `p_v1` and `p_prev` is maximized. This is done by comparing `p_v1 | p_i` with `p_v1 | p_prev` for each `i` and updating `prev` if a larger XOR is found.
4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, it outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the answer.

The program ensures that it does not exceed the limit of 3n queries and correctly handles the interaction with the judge. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
