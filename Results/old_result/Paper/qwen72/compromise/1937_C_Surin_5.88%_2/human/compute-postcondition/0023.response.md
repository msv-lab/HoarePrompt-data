Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 3

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string where the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` are replaced with their respective values.

Substituting the values:
- `{v1}` is replaced with `0`
- `{v2}` is replaced with `3`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
