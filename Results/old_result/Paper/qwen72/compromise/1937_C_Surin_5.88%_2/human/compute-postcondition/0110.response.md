Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1, `r` is the user input.**

The code snippet `r = input('')` assigns the user input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
