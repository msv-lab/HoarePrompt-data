The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written immediately to the output device. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0**
