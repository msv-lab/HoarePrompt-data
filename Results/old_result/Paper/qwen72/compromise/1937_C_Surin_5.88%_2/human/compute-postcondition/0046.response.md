Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is 3, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is 0 if `r` is not `>`, otherwise `prev` is 2.** 

Explanation:
- The code `r = input()` assigns the user's input to the variable `r`.
- If the user's input `r` is `>`, then `prev` is set to 2.
- If the user's input `r` is not `>`, then `prev` remains 0.
- All other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code snippet.
