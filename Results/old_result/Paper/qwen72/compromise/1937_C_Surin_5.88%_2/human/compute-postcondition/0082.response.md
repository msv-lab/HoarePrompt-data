The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written immediately to the output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins, `prev` is 0**
