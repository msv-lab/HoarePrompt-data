The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, which means it ensures that all data written to the standard output is actually sent out immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `i` is 3, `r` is the user's input. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
