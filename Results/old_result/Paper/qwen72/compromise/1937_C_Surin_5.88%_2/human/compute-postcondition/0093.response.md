The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**
