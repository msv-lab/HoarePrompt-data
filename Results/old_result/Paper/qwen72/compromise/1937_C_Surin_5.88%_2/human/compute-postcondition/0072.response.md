Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 3, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 3, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.**
