Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the user input, and the current value of `r` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
