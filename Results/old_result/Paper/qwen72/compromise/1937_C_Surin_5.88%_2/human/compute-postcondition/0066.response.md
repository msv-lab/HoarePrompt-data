Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`
- `v2` is 2
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `n`, and `g` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `v1` and `v2`:**
   - `v1` is initially 0.
   - `v2` is initially 2.
   - If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

2. **Evaluate the print statement:**
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - It will print `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `r` is `<`:**
  - `v1` becomes 1.
  - The print statement will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.

- **If `r` is not `<` (i.e., any other input):**
  - `v1` remains 0.
  - The print statement will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the problem does not specify a particular value for `r`, so we will consider the general case where `r` could be either `<` or something else.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2 (where [v1] is 1 if r is '<', otherwise [v1] is 0)**
