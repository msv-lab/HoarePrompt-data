The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function generates numbers from the start (inclusive) to the stop (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` should start at 1 as per the range definition.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1**
