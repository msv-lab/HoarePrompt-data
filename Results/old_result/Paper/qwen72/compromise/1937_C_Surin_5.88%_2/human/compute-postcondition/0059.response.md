Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
