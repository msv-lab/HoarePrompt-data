Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
   - `i` is 2
   - `prev` is 0
   - `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is updated to 1

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1`: Since no input has been specified as `<` in the initial state, `v1` is 0.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `prev`: The value of `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will substitute the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` into the formatted string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 2 0 0**
