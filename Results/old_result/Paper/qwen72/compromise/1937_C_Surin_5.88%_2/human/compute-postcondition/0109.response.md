The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, which ensures that any buffered data is written out immediately. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or change the program's state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1.**
