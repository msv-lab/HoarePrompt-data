Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The algorithm for encoding a string `s` involves creating an auxiliary string `r` of distinct characters in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. To decode a string `b` that was encoded using this method, we need to reverse the process: create the same auxiliary string `r` and then replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

However, the function `func_1` in the provided program does not follow this logic. Instead, it attempts to map each character in the `encoded` string to a unique character starting from 'a' to 'z'. This approach does not match the encoding process described, and it will not produce the correct original string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Mapping**: The function `func_1` creates a mapping from characters in `encoded` to unique characters starting from 'a'. This is not the same as the symmetric mapping required for decoding.
2. **No Symmetry**: The function does not create the auxiliary string `r` and does not use it to find the symmetric character for each character in `encoded`.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. Create the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of `encoded` in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `encoded` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
