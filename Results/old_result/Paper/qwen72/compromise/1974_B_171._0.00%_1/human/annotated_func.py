    #State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a', and `decoded` is a list containing the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the elements of the `decoded` list, which contains the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a'. The mapping of characters to letters is maintained such that each unique character in `encoded` is assigned a unique letter from 'a' to 'z'. The final state of the program is that `encoded` remains unchanged, `mapping` contains the character-to-letter mappings, and the returned string is the decoded version based on these mappings.
