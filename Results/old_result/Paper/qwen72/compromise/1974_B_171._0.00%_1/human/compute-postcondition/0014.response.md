Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(c)` ('b') is not in `mapping.values()`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary. `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entry `{'a': char}` if it was added, and `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` ('b') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include the entry `{'b': char}`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
