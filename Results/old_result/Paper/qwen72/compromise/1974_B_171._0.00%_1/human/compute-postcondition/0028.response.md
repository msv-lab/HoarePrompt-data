Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping` and `chr(97)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`. `c` is 97 (ord('a')). If `chr(c)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now contains the entry `{'a': char}`, and `chr(c)` ('a') is in `mapping.values()`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
