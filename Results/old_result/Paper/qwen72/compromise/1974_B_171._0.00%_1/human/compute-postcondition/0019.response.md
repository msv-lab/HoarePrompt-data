Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(c)` (which is 'a') is not in `mapping.values()`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary. `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entry `{'a': char}` if it was added, and `c` is 97. If `chr(c)` ('a') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

### Explanation:
The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each letter, it checks if the letter is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary. If it is not, it adds the letter to the `mapping` dictionary with the value `char` and then breaks out of the loop.

- **First Iteration**: When `c` is 97 (which corresponds to 'a'), the loop checks if 'a' is not in `mapping.values()`. Since `mapping` is initially empty, 'a' is not in `mapping.values()`, so the entry `{'a': char}` is added to `mapping`, and the loop breaks.
- **Subsequent Iterations**: Because the loop breaks after the first successful addition, the loop does not execute any further iterations.

Thus, after all iterations, the loop will have executed only once, and the `mapping` dictionary will contain the entry `{'a': char}`. The variables `encoded`, `char`, and `decoded` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `c` is 97, as the loop breaks after the first iteration.
