Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `n` is 8, `x` is 7, `y` is 6, `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list containing [1].** 

The code snippet `b.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `b`, which was not previously defined in the initial state. Therefore, `b` is now a list containing the single element 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
