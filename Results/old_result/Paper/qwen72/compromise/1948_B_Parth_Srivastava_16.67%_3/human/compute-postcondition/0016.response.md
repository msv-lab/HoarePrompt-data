Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a space-separated list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` to create a new list `c` by potentially splitting each integer greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, and appending them to `c` under certain conditions. The final list `c` is then sorted and compared to the original `c`. If `c` is already sorted, the function appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value, but modifies the list `b` to contain either `[1]` or `[0]` based on the sorted condition of `c`. **
