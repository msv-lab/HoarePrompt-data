The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
