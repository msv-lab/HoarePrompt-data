### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case and processes it using the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array:**
   - The function iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the transformed list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The transformation logic is indeed flawed. The conditions for splitting and appending digits are not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not correctly determine that it cannot be sorted.
  - Specifically, the program only checks if the tens digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. This does not account for all possible scenarios where the array can be sorted or cannot be sorted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where multiple elements need to be split and inserted in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.
  - For instance, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will correctly determine that it can be sorted by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` which is sorted.
  - However, for an array like `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will incorrectly determine that it can be sorted by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` which is not sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the given operations. The transformation logic is insufficient and does not handle all edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
