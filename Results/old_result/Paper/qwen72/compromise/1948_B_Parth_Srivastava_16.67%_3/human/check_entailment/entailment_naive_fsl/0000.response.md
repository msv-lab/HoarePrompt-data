Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly process the splitting of numbers and ensuring the array remains sorted after the operation. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
12 3 45 67 89
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
The program should be able to transform the array `[12, 3, 45, 67, 89]` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` by applying the operation to the elements `12`, `45`, `67`, and `89`. However, the program does not correctly handle the splitting of these numbers and the resulting array is not checked for sorting correctly. The program incorrectly appends the original numbers back to the array in some cases, leading to an incorrect result.
