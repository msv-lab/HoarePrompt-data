Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to 10, `i` is equal to `n - 2`.** 

The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
