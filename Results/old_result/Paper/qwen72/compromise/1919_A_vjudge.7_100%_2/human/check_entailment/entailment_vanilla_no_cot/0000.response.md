Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics**: The game involves players taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. A player loses if they cannot make a valid move (i.e., if their wallet is empty and they cannot swap).

2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

3. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the game will always end in a state where both wallets are empty on Bob's turn. This is because each player will always be able to make a move until the total number of coins is zero, which will happen on Bob's turn if the sum is even.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty on Alice's turn. This is because the total number of coins will be zero on Alice's turn if the sum is odd.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks if the sum of the coins is even using the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

This logic is correct and matches the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
