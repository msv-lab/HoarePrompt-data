Output State: **The loop does not modify the `digits` or `letters` lists. The loop checks conditions but does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, `digits` remains a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password`, and `letters` remains a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`.**
