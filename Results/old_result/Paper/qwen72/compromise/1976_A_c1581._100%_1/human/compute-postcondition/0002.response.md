The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password`. If `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters, and `char` will be the first character of `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters, `char` is the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
