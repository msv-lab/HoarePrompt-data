Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, but it does not check if any digit comes after a letter in the password. This can lead to incorrect results.

Example of a case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  ac123
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the digit '1' comes after the letter 'c', which should make the password invalid according to the problem description. However, the program incorrectly returns "YES" because it does not enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.
