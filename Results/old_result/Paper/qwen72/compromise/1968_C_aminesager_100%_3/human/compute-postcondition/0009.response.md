The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
