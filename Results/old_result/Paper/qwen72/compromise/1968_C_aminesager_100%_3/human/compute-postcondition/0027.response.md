Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 3, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 3, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`.
- `i` is 3, so `a[2] + T[2]` is appended to `a`.
- The initial list `a` contains the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1].
- Therefore, the new value appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
