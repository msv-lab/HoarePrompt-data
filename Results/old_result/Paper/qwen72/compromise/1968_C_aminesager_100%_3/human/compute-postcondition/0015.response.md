Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
2. `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500.
3. `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
4. `line` is a string input.
5. `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
6. `i` is `n` - 1.
7. `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input `t` and `n`**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range [0, 10^4 - 1].
   - `n` is an integer within the range [2, 500].

2. **Input `line`**:
   - `line` is a string containing space-separated integers.

3. **List `T`**:
   - `T` is created by splitting `line` into individual elements and converting each element to an integer.
   - For example, if `line` is "1 2 3 4", then `T` will be [1, 2, 3, 4].

4. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list where each element is calculated as follows:
     - The first element is 1000.
     - The second element is 1000 + T[0].
     - The third element is 1000 + T[0] + T[1].
     - And so on, up to the `n-1`-th element, which is 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
   - For example, if `T` is [1, 2, 3, 4] and `n` is 5, then `a` will be [1000, 1001, 1003, 1006, 1010].

5. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` is 4.

6. **Variable `result`**:
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - For example, if `a` is [1000, 1001, 1003, 1006, 1010], then `result` will be "1000 1001 1003 1006 1010".

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The elements of `a` are calculated based on the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `T` starting from 1000.

Output: **"1000 1001 1003 1006 1010" (where the elements are the cumulative sums of the list `T` starting from 1000, and the number of elements is `n`)**

Note: The exact numerical values in the output will depend on the specific values of `T` and `n` provided in the input. The format will always be a string of space-separated integers starting from 1000 and increasing by the cumulative sum of the elements in `T`.
