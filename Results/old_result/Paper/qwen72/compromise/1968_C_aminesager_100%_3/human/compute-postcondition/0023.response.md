Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`.
- `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000.
- `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`, which is the first integer in the list `T`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- The list `a` now contains two elements: 1000 and `1000 + T[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged.
