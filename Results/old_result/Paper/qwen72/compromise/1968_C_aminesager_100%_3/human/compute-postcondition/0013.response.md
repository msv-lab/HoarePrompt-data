Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as an input integer between 2 and 500.
- The list `a` now contains `n` elements. The first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T` (i.e., `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`).
- The variable `line` remains unchanged as the original string input.
- The list `T` remains unchanged as the list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The loop index `i` is `n` - 1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
