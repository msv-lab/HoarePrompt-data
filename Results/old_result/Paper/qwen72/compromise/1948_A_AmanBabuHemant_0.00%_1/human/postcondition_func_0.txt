The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string (which is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times) exceeds 200, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input `t` will have been processed, and the loop will have completed all iterations.
