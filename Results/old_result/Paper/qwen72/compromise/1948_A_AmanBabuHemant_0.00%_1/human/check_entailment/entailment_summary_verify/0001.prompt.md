You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the generated string (which is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times) exceeds 200, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input `t` will have been processed, and the loop will have completed all iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should have a length of at most 200 characters.
   - If no such string can be constructed, we should print "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and pairs are always even in number.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO".

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
   - The pattern '110' is used to construct the string. This pattern ensures that each '1' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other '1' in the pair).
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which simplifies to `3 * (n / 2) = 1.5 * n`.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `1.5 * 50 = 75`, which is well within the 200 character limit.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200, which it always will be given the constraints.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is logically sound and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
   - It correctly handles both the odd and even cases for `n`.
   - The constructed string always has the correct number of special characters and is within the length limit.
