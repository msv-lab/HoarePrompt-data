Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50). The goal is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly \( n \) special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should not exceed 200.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Odd \( n \)**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( n \) is odd, it is impossible to generate a string with exactly \( n \) special characters because each special character must be part of a pair (one character equal to exactly one of its neighbors). Therefore, the number of special characters must be even.
   - The program prints "NO" for odd \( n \), which is correct.

2. **Even \( n \)**:
   - The program generates a string by repeating the pattern "110" \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. This pattern ensures that each "1" is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other "1").
   - The length of the generated string is \( 3 \times \frac{n}{2} = \frac{3n}{2} \). Since \( n \) is at most 50, the maximum length of the generated string is \( \frac{3 \times 50}{2} = 75 \), which is well within the 200-character limit.
   - The program checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200. Since the maximum length is 75, this check is always true for valid inputs (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50 and \( n \) is even).

3. **Output Format**:
   - For each test case, the program prints "NO" if \( n \) is odd, and "YES" followed by the generated string if \( n \) is even and the string length is within the limit.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem constraints and generates the required output. It correctly identifies when a solution is impossible (for odd \( n \)) and when a solution is possible (for even \( n \)). The generated string always meets the length requirement and the special character condition.

Correctness: **True**
