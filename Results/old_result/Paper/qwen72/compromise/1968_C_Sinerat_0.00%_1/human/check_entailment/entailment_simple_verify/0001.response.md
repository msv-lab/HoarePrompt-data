### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a[i]` for \(1 \le i < n\):**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) for \(1 \le i < n\).
   - This construction ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), and the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_{i-1}\).

3. **Checking the conditions:**
   - For each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) must hold.
   - Given \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_{i-1}\), which matches the given \(x_i\).

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the array \(x\), constructs the array \(a\) as described, and prints it.
   - The output format is correct, as it prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 2\). In this case, it will correctly set \(a[0] = 500\) and \(a[1] = 500 + x[0]\), ensuring the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1\) is satisfied.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - For each test case, \(n\) is an integer such that \(2 \le n \le 500\).
  - \(x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\) are integers such that \(1 \le x_i \le 500\).

- **State after initializing `a[0]` to 500:**
  - `a[0]` is set to 500, which is a valid value within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

- **State after the loop to construct `a[i]`:**
  - For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
  - This ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\).

- **State at the end of the function:**
  - For each test case, the output is a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `a[0]` is 500, and for each \(1 \le i < n\), `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and the elements \(x[1]\) to \(x[i-1]\).
  - The values of \(t\), \(n\), and \(x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \(a\) based on the given conditions and handles all edge cases. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior align with the problem requirements.
