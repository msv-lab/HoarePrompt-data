Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to a position within the first `m` people. The function `func_1` is called but it does not actually perform the necessary calculations to find the minimum cost. Additionally, the function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which would result in a runtime error in Python. 

A specific case where the program fails is:
- Input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
14
```
- Actual Output:
The program will raise a `NameError` because `func_1` is called before it is defined.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be defined before it is called, and the logic inside `func_1` should be corrected to properly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
