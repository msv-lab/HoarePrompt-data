### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')` to ensure that the minimum cost is found correctly.

3. **Bribery Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the queue from the last person to the first person.
   - For each person at position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of bribing the person at position `i` plus the accumulated cost `x`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the minimum cost `pergunta` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm aims to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position up to `m`.
  - By iterating from the last person to the first, it ensures that Kirill can bribe the most expensive people first, which is a valid approach since the cost to bribe a person at position `j` (where `j < i`) is `a[j]`, and the cost to bribe each person between `j` and `i` is `b[k]` (where `j < k < i`).
  - The variable `x` accumulates the cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person, which is used to update `pergunta` when `i` is less than `m`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already in the last position and doesn't need to bribe anyone).
  - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (Kirill needs to bribe everyone to get to the front).

- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position up to `m` in the queue. The initialization, iteration, and cost calculation are all consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
