Postcondition: ***`a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0. If `j` is less than `m`, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` is increased by 1. If `j` is equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
