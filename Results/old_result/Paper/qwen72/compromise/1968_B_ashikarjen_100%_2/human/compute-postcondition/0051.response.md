Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. The function then calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order and prints this number as `k`. The function does not return any value. **
