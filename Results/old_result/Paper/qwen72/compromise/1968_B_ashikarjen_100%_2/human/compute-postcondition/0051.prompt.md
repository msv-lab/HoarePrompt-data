You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `a` is a string containing the input of two integers separated by a space, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of these two integers, `b` is a new input string, `m` is the length of `b`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[n-1]` or `j` is equal to `m` if no such index exists. If `j < m`, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order. If `j` is equal to `m` or no such index exists for any character in `a`, the loop breaks early and `k` is the number of matches found before the loop broke.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, or 0 if no such matches are found before the loop breaks)
    return
    #The program returns the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j] == a[n-1]` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns the value of `k`, which represents the number of characters in string `a` that have a matching character in string `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j]` matches the last character of `a` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the same relative order, up to the point where `b[j] == a[n-1]` or until the loop breaks if no such index exists.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
