The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 10, because the loop starts from 10 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `i` should be 10 at the start of the loop, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 10 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5, `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], `sum_values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45], `total` is 45, `i` is 10**
