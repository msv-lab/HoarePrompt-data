Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input, representing the largest number Vladislav writes. It then calculates the cumulative sum of a sequence of values based on the digits of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The function prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers each between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5, and `sum_values` is a list containing the cumulative sums up to the largest `n` in the test cases. **
