The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the implicit range defined by `range(10)`. The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, or `total`. However, to ensure the loop can start, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, as it is the initial value for the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5 for the last test case, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
