You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it processes numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` is incorrect because it treats the remainder as a single digit, which is not always the case. For example, when `i = 100`, `word[:-1]` will be `"10"`, and `remainder` will be `10`, but the sum of the digits of `100` should be `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`, not `10`. This incorrect handling of the remainder will lead to incorrect sums for numbers with more than two digits.

To fix this, the program should correctly compute the sum of the digits of the remainder, not just treat it as a single digit.
