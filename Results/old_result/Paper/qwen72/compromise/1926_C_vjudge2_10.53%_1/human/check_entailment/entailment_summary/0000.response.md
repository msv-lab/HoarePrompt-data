Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. This is a good approach to avoid recalculating the sum of digits for the same number multiple times.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation**:
   - For numbers from 1 to 9, the program correctly sets `values[i]` to `i` and calculates the cumulative sum `sum_values[i]`.
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the program converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder. It then calculates the sum of digits for the current number by adding the sum of the last digit and the sum of the remainder. This is correct because the sum of the digits of a number `i` can be broken down into the sum of the last digit and the sum of the digits of the remainder.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly updates `sum_values[i]` by adding the current value `values[i]` to the cumulative sum of the previous number `sum_values[i - 1]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a precomputed list to store the sum of digits and cumulative sums, which allows it to handle each test case in constant time after the initial computation. This is efficient and should meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, especially since the maximum value of `n` is 2 Â· 10^5.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1, 2, or 3, and when `n` is a large number like 200000.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
