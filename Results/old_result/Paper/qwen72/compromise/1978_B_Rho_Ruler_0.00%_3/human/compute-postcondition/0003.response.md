Output State: **The program returns True.**

Explanation: 
The value of `ans` is calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a`. Given the constraints, `ans` is a weighted sum of `a` and `b` where `k` is the weight for `b` and `n - k` is the weight for `a`. The return statement checks if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Since `ans` is a combination of `a` and `b` with weights that sum up to `n`, and `max(a, b)` is the largest value between `a` and `b`, the inequality `ans <= n * max(a, b)` always holds true. Therefore, the program returns True.
