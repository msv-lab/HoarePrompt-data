The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a new list `a_new`. The first element of `a_new` is the smallest unique element from `a`, and each subsequent element in `a_new` is the difference between consecutive unique elements in the sorted list derived from `a`. The original list `a` remains unchanged.
