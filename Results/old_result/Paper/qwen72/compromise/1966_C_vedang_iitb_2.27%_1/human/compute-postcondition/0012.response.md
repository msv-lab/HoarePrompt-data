Postcondition: **a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(a). n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and n is greater than 2. `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. `winNext` is either 0 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1.**
