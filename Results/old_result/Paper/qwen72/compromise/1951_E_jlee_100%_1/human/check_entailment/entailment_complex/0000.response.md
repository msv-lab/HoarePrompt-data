Reasoning:  
The program aims to partition a string into non-palindromic substrings. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` to determine the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the string length `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If all characters in the string are the same, it prints 'NO' because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, it checks if the middle character (in the case of an odd-length string) is different from the rest. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the string to find a non-palindromic partition.
   - It checks if the first and last characters are different. If so, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - It also checks for the first character that is different from the first character `x` and the first character that is different from `x` after the first different character. If such characters are found, it prints 'YES' and the appropriate partition of the string.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If no valid partition is found by the loop, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Corrections:
- The logic for handling the case where all but one character are the same is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if s[(n - 1) // 2] != x` is not necessary and can be simplified.
- The loop logic is overly complex and can be simplified. For example, if the string has at least two different characters, it can always be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.

### Simplified Logic:
- If the string length is 1, print 'NO'.
- If the string has at least two different characters, print 'YES' and a valid partition.
- If all characters are the same, print 'NO'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(set(string)) > 1:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(string[0], string[1:])
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- **Set Check**: `len(set(string)) > 1` checks if the string has at least two different characters. If it does, the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings: the first character and the rest of the string.
- **Single Character Check**: If the string length is 1, it is a palindrome, so the function prints 'NO'.
- **All Same Characters Check**: If all characters are the same, the function prints 'NO' because any substring will be a palindrome.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has some logical issues and can be simplified.
- The corrected program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False** (The original program has issues and can be simplified to a more correct and efficient version.)
