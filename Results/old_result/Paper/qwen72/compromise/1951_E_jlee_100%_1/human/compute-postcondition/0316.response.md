Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i + 1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `done` is `False`, `x` is the first character of `string`. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `n` is even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, the program continues with the next part of the loop.***
