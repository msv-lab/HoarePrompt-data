Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count2` is 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- `done` becomes True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- Otherwise, `done` remains False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` is set to 1.
2. **Variable `string`**: The variable `string` is an input string, and `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
3. **Variable `s`**: The list `s` is derived from `string` and has at least one character, and its length `n` is greater than 1.
4. **Variable `x`**: The variable `x` is the first character of `s`, which is also the first character of `string`.
5. **Variable `count`**: The variable `count` is greater than 0.
6. **Variable `count2`**: The variable `count2` is 1 if `s[j]` (i.e., `s[1]`) is equal to `x` (i.e., the first character of `s`).
7. **Variable `done`**: The variable `done` becomes True if `s[j]` (i.e., `s[1]`) is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (i.e., `s[n - 2]`), otherwise it remains False.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement splits the `string` into two parts:
- `string[:j]`: This is the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j` (which is 1).
- `string[j:]`: This is the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j` (which is 1) to the end.

### Output Calculation:
- `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string` because `j` is 1.
- `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character to the end.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of string starting from the second character]**
