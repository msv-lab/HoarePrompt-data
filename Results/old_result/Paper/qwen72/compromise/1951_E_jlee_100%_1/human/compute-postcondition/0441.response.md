Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters. It returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is based on the processing of the corresponding string in the list `s`. If the input `t` or `s` does not meet the constraints, the function's behavior is undefined.**
