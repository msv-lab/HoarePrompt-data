To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 1 character.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count2` is 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
   - `done` becomes True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains False.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.
   - `j` is 1, so `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Given `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
