To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
- `done` remains unchanged if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

### Analysis:
1. **String Length and Indexing**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `j` is 1.
   - `s[j]` refers to the second character of the string `s`.
   - `s[n - 1 - j]` refers to the second-to-last character of the string `s`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `s[j]` (the second character) is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (the second-to-last character), `done` remains unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
   - If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1 and the current iteration is skipped.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the values of `count`, `count2`, or `done`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' because the conditions described in the initial state do not affect the execution of the print statement. The print statement is a simple output command that does not depend on the values of `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
