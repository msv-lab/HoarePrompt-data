Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string `string` from the input. The function checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (either 1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all input strings have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
