Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `count2` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, `done` remains unchanged and `count2` is not modified.***
