Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, `done` is also True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` remains less than or equal to `count`, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `count` > 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count` and `count` ≤ 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or if `count` is not less than 1, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 2, and `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` is not less than 1, otherwise `done` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, and `count2` is 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and 3 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `count` > 0, `count` remains greater than 0 and `done` remains False. If `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` < `count`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` == `count`, `count` remains greater than 0 and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > `count`, `done` is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
