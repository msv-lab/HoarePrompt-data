Output State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x`. `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. `count` is greater than 1, and `done` is True. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
