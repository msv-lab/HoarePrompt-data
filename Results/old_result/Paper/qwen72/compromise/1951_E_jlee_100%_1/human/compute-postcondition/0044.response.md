Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is `j`, `count2` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is less than 1, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
