Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` remains less than or equal to `count`, and `done` remains False. If `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` remains False.***
