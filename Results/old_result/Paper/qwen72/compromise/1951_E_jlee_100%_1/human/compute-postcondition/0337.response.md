Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- If `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to True; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
