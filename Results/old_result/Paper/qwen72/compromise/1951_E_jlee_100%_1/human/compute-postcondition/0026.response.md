Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `string` is an input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s`.
6. `done` is False.
7. `x` is the first character of `s`.
8. `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.
9. `n` is not 1.
10. The count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`.
11. The current count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`.
12. Either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze what the `print(1)` statement will output:

- The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- None of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state affect the value being printed by the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is:

Output: **1**
