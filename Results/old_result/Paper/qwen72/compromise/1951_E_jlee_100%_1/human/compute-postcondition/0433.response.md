Output State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `count` is 1 or greater, `done` remains unchanged.**
