Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The values of `n`, `j`, `count`, and `done` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
