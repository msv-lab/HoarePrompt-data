The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition provides information about the variables `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
