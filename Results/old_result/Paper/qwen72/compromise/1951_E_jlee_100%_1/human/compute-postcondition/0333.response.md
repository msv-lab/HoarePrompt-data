Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0. If the first character of `string` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.***
