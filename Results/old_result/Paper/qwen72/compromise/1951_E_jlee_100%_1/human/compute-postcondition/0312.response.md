Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `count` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `t` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and conditions, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The condition `if x is not equal to the last character of s` is mentioned, but it does not influence the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not inside a loop or conditional block that would be affected by this condition.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
