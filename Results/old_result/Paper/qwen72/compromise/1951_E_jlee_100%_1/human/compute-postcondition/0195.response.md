Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `count2` is less than `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is 0.
   - The slice `string[:j]` will be an empty string because it starts from the beginning of the string and goes up to (but not including) index 0.
   - The slice `string[j:]` will be the entire string `string` because it starts from index 0 and goes to the end of the string.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the entire string `string`)**
