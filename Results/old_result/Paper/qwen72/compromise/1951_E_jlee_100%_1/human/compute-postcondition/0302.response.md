Output State: **`n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i + 1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `done` is `False`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
