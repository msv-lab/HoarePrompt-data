Output State: **`n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i + 1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `done` is `False`, `x` is the first character of `string`. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, the program also skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.**
