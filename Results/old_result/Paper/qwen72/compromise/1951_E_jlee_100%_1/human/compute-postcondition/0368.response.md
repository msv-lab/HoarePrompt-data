The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` remains unchanged**
