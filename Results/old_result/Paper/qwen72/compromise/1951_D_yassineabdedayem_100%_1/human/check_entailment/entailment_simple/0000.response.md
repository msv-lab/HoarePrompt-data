### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `n == k`:**
     - This means Alice has exactly enough coins to buy `k` jewels at a price of 1 coin each.
     - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 1 (indicating one stall), and then 1 (indicating the price per jewel is 1).
   - **If `n + 2 > k * 2`:**
     - This condition checks if Alice can buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls.
     - The first stall is set to a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, which ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
     - The second stall is set to a price of 1 coin per jewel, which ensures that Alice can buy the remaining 1 jewel.
     - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 2 (indicating two stalls), and then the prices `n - k + 1` and 1.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - The program correctly prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` by setting up a single stall with a price of 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `n + 2 > k * 2` by setting up two stalls with the appropriate prices.
   - The program correctly identifies when it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirement.

4. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The prices are within the allowed range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and constraints. It correctly determines whether Bob can set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and provides the necessary output in each case.

### Correctness:
**True**
