Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, the function does not perform the required symmetric replacement correctly. Instead, it replaces all characters in the string `s` with the last unique character in the sorted list of unique characters, and it incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters that are not part of the original unique set.

Here’s a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Symmetric Replacement**: The function should replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters. For example, if `b` is "serofedsoc", the unique characters are "cdefors", and the first character 's' should be replaced by 'c', the second 'e' by 'o', and so on. However, the function replaces all characters with the last unique character, which is incorrect.

2. **Modification of `unique_chars`**: The function incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters that are not part of the original unique set. This is not part of the decoding process and leads to an incorrect final state of the `unique_chars` list.

3. **Output**: The function returns `unique_chars` as a joined string, which is not the correct decoded string `s`.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the sorted list of unique characters `r`.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- Use this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `s`.

Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

This corrected function:
- Constructs the sorted list of unique characters.
- Creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
- Uses this mapping to construct the decoded string `decoded_str`.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
