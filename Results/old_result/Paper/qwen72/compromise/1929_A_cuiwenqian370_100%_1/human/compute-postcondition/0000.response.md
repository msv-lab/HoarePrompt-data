Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t`, followed by the input for `t` test cases. Each test case input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The `input` variable is now a reference to the `read` method of the `sys.stdin` object.**

Explanation:
- The `input` variable is reassigned to reference the `read` method of the `sys.stdin` object.
- The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the reassignment of `input`.
