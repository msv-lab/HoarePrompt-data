Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not the optimal approach for maximizing the beauty. However, the problem actually requires the maximum beauty, which can be achieved by maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Calculating Beauty**: The function then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is obtained by arranging the array such that the largest and smallest elements alternate, maximizing the differences.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. This can be achieved by:
1. Sorting the array.
2. Rearranging the sorted array to alternate between the largest and smallest elements.

For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]`, which gives a beauty of \( (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 \).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: The function `func_2` reads the input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case.
- **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the length of the array and the array itself, then calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
- **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it sorts the array and calculates the beauty based on the sorted array, which does not maximize the beauty. The correct approach should involve rearranging the array to alternate between the largest and smallest elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
