Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has duplicate elements correctly. The problem description specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the function `func_1` calculates the beauty using `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`, which is incorrect because the beauty should be calculated as \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. This can lead to incorrect results when the array has duplicate elements or when the elements are already in a specific order that maximizes the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
The expected output is 0 because all elements are the same, and the beauty should be \((1 - 1) + (1 - 1) = 0\). However, the program will output 0, which is correct in this case, but it is not because of the correct logic. The program will also output 0 for the input:
```
1
3
3 1 1
```
But the correct output should be \((1 - 3) + (1 - 1) = -2 + 0 = -2\), not 0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
