It seems there was a misunderstanding. The function definition provided in the problem description is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct this and extract the precondition based on the provided problem description and function definition.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to find all subdirectories in the current working directory whose names are numeric and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`. For each qualifying subdirectory, the function lists all `.html` files and generates two new files, `*-ac.py` and `*-wa.py`, for each `.html` file found.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, and the current working directory contains subdirectories with numeric names.**
