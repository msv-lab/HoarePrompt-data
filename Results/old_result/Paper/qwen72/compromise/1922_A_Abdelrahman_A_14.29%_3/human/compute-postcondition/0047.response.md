The given `print` statement is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
- `i` is 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `tests` must be greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `slength` is an input integer, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `a` is an input string, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `b` is a new input string, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `c` is a new input string that must have at least two characters, and `x` is the second character of `c`, but neither `c` nor `x` is used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
