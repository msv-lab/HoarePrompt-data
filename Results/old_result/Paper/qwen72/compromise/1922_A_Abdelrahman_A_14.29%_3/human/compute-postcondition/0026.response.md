Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string that must contain at least three characters, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the third character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
