You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program: 
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters `t` (number of test cases), and for each test case, `n` (number of cards each player receives) and `a` (list of integers representing the cards in your hand). The parameters should satisfy: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in `a`.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the number of duplicate card values in the list `a` for that test case. The function `func` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description. The parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes each test case by counting the number of duplicate card values in the list `a` for that test case, and prints the count. The function does not modify the parameters `t`, `n`, or `a`. It does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input (stdin). It takes every second line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card numbers in the player's hand for each test case.

2. **Card Counting**: The program then splits each line into tokens (card numbers) and calculates the difference between the total number of cards (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique cards (`len({*tokens})`). This difference represents the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The logic behind the scoring is based on the fact that for each duplicate card in the player's hand, the player can score a point when playing the second card of that number, assuming Nene does not play the same card before the player does. This is because the first time a card with a particular number is played, no points are scored, but the second time, a point is scored if the same number is already on the table.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program assumes that the player will always play optimally, which means the player will try to maximize their points by playing the second card of a duplicate as soon as possible. However, the program does not explicitly consider Nene's optimal play, which is to maximize her score and minimize the player's score. Despite this, the program's logic is correct because the number of points the player can score is determined by the number of duplicates in their hand, and Nene's optimal play does not change this fact.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of points the player can score for each test case, which is the number of duplicates in the player's hand.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by taking their turns optimally, considering Nene's optimal play.
