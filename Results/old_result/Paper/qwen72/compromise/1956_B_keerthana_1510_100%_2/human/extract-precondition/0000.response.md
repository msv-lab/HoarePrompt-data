Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters `t` (number of test cases), and for each test case, `n` (number of cards each player receives) and `a` (list of integers representing the cards in your hand). The parameters should satisfy: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in `a`.**
