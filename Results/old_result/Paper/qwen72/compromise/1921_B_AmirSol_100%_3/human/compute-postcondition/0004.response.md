Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, either with `s1[i]` being '0' and `s2[i]` being '1', or with `s1[i]` being '1' and `s2[i]` being '0'. **
