Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). It does this by counting the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of days required is the maximum of these two counts, as you can only perform one operation per day, and you need to ensure that all necessary additions and removals are completed.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the result for each case. The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem requirements.
