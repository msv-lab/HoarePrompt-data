Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is `2 - inx`. If `a[2] < a[1]`, `ans[2]` is set to 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[1]` to `inx2`. Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1, and thus `inx2` is set to `last[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
