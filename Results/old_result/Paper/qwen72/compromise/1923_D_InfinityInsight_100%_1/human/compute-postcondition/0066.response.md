The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` has a length between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a list `ans` that has been updated based on the following conditions: For each index `i` in the range from 1 to \(n-1\), if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is determined by the function `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is the value of `last[i-1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx` is less than 0, the update is skipped. The final value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `a`, `left`, and `last`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of `a`. It returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, or to `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i-1]`, and is skipped if `inx` is less than 0.**
