The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Depending on the initial state, the list `last` can be either `[-1, 1, 2]` or `[-1, -1, -1]`.

- If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is `[-1, 1, 2]`, and the last element is `2`. After appending `2`, `last` becomes `[-1, 1, 2, 2]`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is `[-1, -1, -1]`, and the last element is `-1`. After appending `-1`, `last` becomes `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3. `left` is a list containing a single integer 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, 2, and 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, -1, and -1. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1. `i` is 3.**
