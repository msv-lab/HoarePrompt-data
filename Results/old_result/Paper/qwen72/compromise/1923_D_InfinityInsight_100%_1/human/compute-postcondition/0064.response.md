Output State: **The list `a` remains unchanged, with elements satisfying \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\). The integer `n` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 1. The list `left` remains unchanged, containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0. The list `last` remains unchanged, with each element being the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before. The list `ans` is now updated for all indices from 1 to \(n-1\). For each index `i` in the range 1 to \(n-1\), if `a[i] < a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `inx2` is `last[i-1]`. If `inx2 < inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx < 0`, the update is skipped. The variable `i` is the last element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The list `a` remains the same as it was initially, with each element still within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and the length of the list still within \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- The integer `n` is still the length of the list `a` and is greater than 1.
- The list `left` remains the same, containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0.
- The list `last` remains the same, with each element being the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before.
- The list `ans` is now updated for all indices from 1 to \(n-1\). For each index `i`:
  - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1.
  - Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the index found by `func_1(left, x)` and `inx2` is `last[i-1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx` is updated to `inx2`. If `inx` is less than 0, the update is skipped.
- The variable `i` is the last element in the list `a`.
