Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 3, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1 except `ans[1]` which is `2 - inx2`, `ans[2]` which is set to 1 if `a[2] < a[1]`, and `ans[3]` which is set to 1 if `a[3] < a[2]`, `i` is 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inx2 = last[i - 1]` updates the value of `inx2` to `last[2]` because `i` is 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
