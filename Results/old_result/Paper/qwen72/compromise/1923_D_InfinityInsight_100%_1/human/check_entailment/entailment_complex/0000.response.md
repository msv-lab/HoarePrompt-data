### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a list of slimes with sizes \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
     - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` plus 1.
     - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` could be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.

   - **func_2**:
     - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from the left.
     - It uses a list `left` to store cumulative sums of the slime sizes.
     - It uses a list `last` to store the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index.
     - It iterates through the list `a` and updates the `ans` list based on the conditions:
       - If the current slime is smaller than the previous slime, it is eaten in 1 second.
       - Otherwise, it uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime that is large enough to eat the current slime.
       - It updates `ans[i]` to the minimum of the found index and the last occurrence index.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` on the list `a` and its reverse.
   - It then combines the results from both directions to find the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1**:
     - The function correctly returns the index of the first element greater than or equal to `x` or -1 if `x` is less than 0.
     - This is used to find the next larger slime in the cumulative sum list.

   - **func_2**:
     - The function correctly calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from the left.
     - It uses the cumulative sum list `left` to efficiently find the next larger slime.
     - The `last` list helps in tracking the last occurrence of the same value, which is used to avoid unnecessary checks.

   - **Main Program**:
     - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It calls `func_2` on the original list and its reverse to consider both left and right neighbors.
     - It combines the results to find the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where a slime cannot be eaten (returns -1).
   - It correctly handles the cumulative sum and last occurrence tracking.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten by considering both left and right neighbors and combining the results.

Correctness: **True**
