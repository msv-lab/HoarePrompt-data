The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are non-negative integers with specific constraints: `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`, `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`. It returns a single integer value calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned value is the result of this expression, and the input parameters `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
