Output State: **No variables are directly modified by the code snippet, but the function is prepared to read input and process each test case. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet is a comment block that describes the purpose of the function, which is to read input and process each test case.
- No actual code is executed in this snippet, so the values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain as they were initially described.
- The function is now ready to read input and process the test cases, but this does not change the initial state of the variables.
