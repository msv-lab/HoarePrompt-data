The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it interacts with the input to obtain `t`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The exact return value is not specified in the constraints, but it likely involves some comparison or processing of `row1` and `row2`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of `row1` and `row2`.**
