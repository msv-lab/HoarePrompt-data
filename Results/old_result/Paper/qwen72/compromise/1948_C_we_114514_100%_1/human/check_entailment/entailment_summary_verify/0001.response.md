### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a 2xN grid where each cell has an arrow pointing either left or right.
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, up, or down; then, it follows the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Constraints:**
   - \( n \) is even.
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, n).
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move to the rightmost column (n) without getting stuck in a loop or moving outside the grid.

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(n, row1, row2):**
     - The function checks if the robot can reach (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
     - It divides the grid into segments of 2 columns each and checks if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row and then to the right.
     - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (since \( n \) is even, \( n/2 \) segments).
     - For each segment, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then move right.
     - Specifically, it checks if the robot encounters a cell in the first row that points left and the corresponding cells in the second row also point left, which would block the robot from moving to the second row and then to the right.
     - Finally, it checks if the last cell in the first row points left and the second-to-last cell in the second row points left, which would also block the robot from reaching the rightmost cell in the second row.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the robot is stuck in a segment due to left-pointing arrows.
   - It also correctly checks the last segment to ensure the robot can reach the rightmost cell in the second row.

6. **Function 2:**
   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads \( n \), the first row of arrows, and the second row of arrows.
     - It calls **func_1(n, row1, row2)** for each test case and appends the result to a list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment states that the program correctly checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints.
- The logic in **func_1** is sound and handles all necessary cases.
- **func_2** correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Verification:

- **func_1**:
  - The function checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then to the right.
  - It correctly identifies if the robot is blocked by left-pointing arrows in the first half of the grid.
  - It also correctly checks the last segment to ensure the robot can reach the rightmost cell in the second row.
  - The function returns 'No' if the robot is blocked in any segment and 'Yes' otherwise.

- **func_2**:
  - The function reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It correctly calls **func_1** for each test case and collects the results.
  - It prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is correct and handles all necessary cases as described in the problem. The logic in **func_1** is sound, and **func_2** correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
