You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':

        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It reads these inputs from the standard input, calls `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` for each test case, and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 2xN grid, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, up, or down; then, it follows the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Constraints:**
   - \( n \) is even.
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row from the first row if it encounters a cell with an arrow pointing down.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move to the rightmost column (n) without getting stuck in a loop or moving outside the grid.

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(n, row1, row2):**
     - The function checks if the robot can reach (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
     - It divides the grid into segments of 2 columns each and checks if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row and then to the right.
     - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (since \( n \) is even, \( n/2 \) segments).
     - For each segment, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then move right.
     - If the robot encounters a cell in the first row that points left and the corresponding cells in the second row also point left, it returns 'No'.
     - Finally, it checks if the last cell in the first row points left and the second-to-last cell in the second row points left. If so, it returns 'No'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the robot is stuck in a segment due to left-pointing arrows.
   - It also correctly checks the last segment to ensure the robot can reach the rightmost cell in the second row.

6. **Function 2:**
   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads \( n \), the first row of arrows, and the second row of arrows.
     - It calls **func_1(n, row1, row2)** for each test case and appends the result to a list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic in **func_1** is sound and handles all necessary cases, while **func_2** correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
