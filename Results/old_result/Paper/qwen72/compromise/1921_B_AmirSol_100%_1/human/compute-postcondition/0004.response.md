Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (denoted as `cats_to_add`), and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (denoted as `cats_to_remove`). The function returns the maximum of these two values. **
