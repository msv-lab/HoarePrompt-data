The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function operates on global or predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. These variables are structured as follows: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n`, where for each index `i`, -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `False`, `0`, and `1` respectively. `nodes` is an empty list. The function returns a modified version of these lists or a result derived from them, but the specific output is not provided in the given context.

Functionality: **The function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`, where `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) with specific constraints, and `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized lists of length `n`. The function returns a result or modifies these lists based on some internal logic, but the exact output is not specified.**
