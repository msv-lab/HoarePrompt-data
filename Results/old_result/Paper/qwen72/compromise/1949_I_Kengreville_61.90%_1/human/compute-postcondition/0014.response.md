Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` with all elements set to `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` because at least one `c1` is not `0` after the DFS for any `i`.**
