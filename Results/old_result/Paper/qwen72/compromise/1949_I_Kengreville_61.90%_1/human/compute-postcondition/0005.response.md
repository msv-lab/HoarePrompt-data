Postcondition: ***If `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, and `visited[i]` is `False`, then after the loop executes all iterations, the `visited` list will have `True` for all disks that are directly or indirectly connected to the i-th disk through a chain of disks where the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers. The `nodes` list will include all indices of these disks. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated for each disk that is part of the connected component, with `coef0[j]` set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` set to `-coef1[i]` for each connected disk `j`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` will remain unchanged. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the program does not modify any of the lists.***
