Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers, which are stored in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. It then performs a series of depth-first search (DFS) operations on the nodes, updating the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists. After all DFS operations, the function checks if the sum of `coef1` values for any set of connected nodes is non-zero. If this condition is met for any set, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program is that `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the input integers, `visited` is a list of `True` values, `coef0` is a list of `0` values, and `coef1` is a list of `1` values, with `nodes` being an empty list. **
