### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to keep track of disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS for Connected Components**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The `dfs` function is called for each disk that has not been visited yet.
   - During the DFS, the program checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.
   - If disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the connected disks.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, for the starting disk of each connected component.
   - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i`, the coefficients are updated as follows:
     - `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`
     - `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`
   - These updates ensure that the sum of the radii changes in a way that maintains tangency. Specifically, the update `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` imply that the new radius of disk `j` is adjusted based on the new radius of disk `i` and the original tangency condition.

4. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After the DFS for a connected component, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in that component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it means that it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The variable `ok` is used to track if any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `ok` is `True` after processing all connected components, the program prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call**: The initial state is correctly described. `n` is an integer within the valid range, and `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n`. `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized appropriately.
- **State After Input Parsing**: The state after parsing the input is correctly described. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are populated with valid integers, and `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to `False`, `None`, and `None` respectively.
- **State After DFS**:
  - The `dfs` function correctly marks disks as visited and appends them to the `nodes` list.
  - The tangency check is correctly implemented using the distance formula.
  - The coefficient updates `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` are consistent with the problem's requirements.
  - The final state after the DFS is correctly described. `visited` is updated to `True` for all disks in the connected component, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated accordingly.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
- The coefficient updates ensure that the new radii maintain tangency and potentially reduce the sum of all radii.
- The sum of `coef1` being non-zero is a valid condition to determine if the radii can be changed to strictly decrease the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner.

Final: **True**
