### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.
   - It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited nodes, coefficients for the linear equation, and the sign of the coefficients, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to store the indices of connected disks during the DFS traversal.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore all disks that are directly or indirectly connected to the `i`-th disk, where the sum of their radii equals the distance between their centers.
   - For each disk `i`, if it is not visited, it is marked as visited and added to the `nodes` list.
   - For each connected disk `j` (where the sum of radii equals the distance between centers), the function updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on `j`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After the DFS traversal, the function `func_1` checks if the sum of `coef1` values for any set of connected nodes is non-zero.
   - If there is at least one set of connected nodes where the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **DFS and Connectivity**:
  - The DFS traversal correctly identifies all disks that are directly or indirectly tangent to each other.
  - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that only disks that are tangent (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii) are considered connected.

- **Coefficient Updates**:
  - The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are used to represent a linear equation of the form `coef0[i] + coef1[i] * new_radius[i] = r[i]`.
  - The updates `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` ensure that the new radii maintain the tangency condition while allowing for a decrease in the sum of radii.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The final check `if c1 != 0` ensures that there is at least one set of connected disks where the sum of the `coef1` values is non-zero.
  - If `c1` is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The DFS traversal ensures that all connected components are explored, and the coefficient updates ensure that the tangency condition is maintained. The final check ensures that the sum of radii can be decreased.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
