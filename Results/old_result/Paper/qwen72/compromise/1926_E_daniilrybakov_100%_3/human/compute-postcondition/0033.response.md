The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0**
