Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is now `n // 4` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` further divides `n` by 2, updating `n` to `n // 4`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` still hold true.
