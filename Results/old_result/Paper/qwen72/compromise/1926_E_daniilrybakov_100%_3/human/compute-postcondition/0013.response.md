The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is now `n // 2`, which means `n` has been halved. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be non-zero after being halved.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers with `n` being non-zero, `s` is now `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now `n // 2` and must be non-zero**
