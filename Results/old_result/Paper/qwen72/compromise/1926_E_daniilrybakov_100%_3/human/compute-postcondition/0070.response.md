Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 2)` and must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still `(n // 2)` and must be at least 1, `t` is still greater than 0, `k` is still an input integer, `s` is still `x`, and `m` is still 2.
