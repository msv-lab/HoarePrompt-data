Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now the integer division of its original value by 2.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `s` remains 0.
- `m` remains 1.
- `x` remains `(n + 1) // 2`, but since `n` has been updated, `x` will also be recalculated based on the new value of `n`. However, the initial state specifies `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, and since `n` has been halved, the new value of `x` is now `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.
