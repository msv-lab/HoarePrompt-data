Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers and `n` must be non-zero, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which means `x` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.
