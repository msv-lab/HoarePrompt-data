Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is now `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The previous values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `t` is still greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `n` is still `n // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is still an input integer.
- `s` is still `s + x`.
- `m` is still 4.
