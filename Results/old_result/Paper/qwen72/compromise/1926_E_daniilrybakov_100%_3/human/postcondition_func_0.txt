The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function calculates and prints a value for each test case based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the last input integer for the final test case, `s` is the sum of the values of `(n + 1) // 2` from each iteration until `n` becomes 0, and `m` is the highest power of 2 that divides the initial `n` without remainder.
