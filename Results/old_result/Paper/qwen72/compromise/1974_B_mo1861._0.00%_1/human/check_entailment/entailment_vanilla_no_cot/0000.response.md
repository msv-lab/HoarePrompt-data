Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it constructs the `char_map` dictionary. Specifically, the line:

```python
char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```

is incorrect. The program should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character in the same set, not to a character based on the length of `b`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Unique Characters**: First, we extract the unique characters from the string `b` and sort them alphabetically.
2. **Character Mapping**: We create a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set is mapped to its symmetric character in the same set.
3. **Decoding**: We then iterate over the string `b` and replace each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

This corrected program will correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.
