Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. Specifically, the `char_map` dictionary is constructed by mapping each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, which is incorrect. The problem requires that the characters in `b` be mapped to their symmetric counterparts in the auxiliary string `r`, which consists of all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.

For example, consider the input `b = "serofedsoc"`. The correct auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`. However, the program constructs a `char_map` that maps:
- 'c' to 'z',
- 'd' to 'y',
- 'e' to 'x',
- 'f' to 'w',
- 'o' to 'v',
- 'r' to 'u',
- 's' to 't'.

This is clearly different from the required mapping:
- 'c' to 's',
- 'd' to 'r',
- 'e' to 'o',
- 'f' to 'f',
- 'o' to 'e',
- 'r' to 'd',
- 's' to 'c'.

Thus, the program will not produce the correct output for this input. The correct output should be `"codeforces"`, but the program will produce a different string.
