To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head: `i`, `c`, and the result of `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

1. **`i` and `c`**: These are the variables that will be assigned values from the enumeration of the sorted set of `b`. They do not need to be adjusted directly, as they will be set by the loop itself.
2. **`b`**: The string `b` must contain at least one unique character for the loop to execute. If `b` is empty or contains only repeated characters, the set of `b` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **`char_map`**: This is mentioned in the state but is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, we need to ensure that `b` contains at least one unique character.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`**
