You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x`, both less than \(2^{30}\). It iterates through the bits of `x` and modifies `a` based on certain conditions. The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a specific bit pattern matching `x` during the iteration, or -1 if no such pattern is found. If no valid pattern is found and the list `a` is empty, the function returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` to handle different types of input. These functions are used to read integers, lists of integers, and strings.
   - The main function `func_5` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the function `func_5` reads the length of the array `n` and the number `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `t` and sets `ans` to -1.
   - The function iterates over the bits from the most significant bit (29th bit) to the least significant bit (0th bit).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 (`u == 0`).
       - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd (`v % 2`), it returns `ans` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even, it processes the array to split it into segments where the `i`-th bit is 0.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 (`u == 1`):
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit.
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is 0, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all bits, the function returns the maximum value of `ans` or the length of the array `a`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the bitwise operations and segment counting are implemented correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
