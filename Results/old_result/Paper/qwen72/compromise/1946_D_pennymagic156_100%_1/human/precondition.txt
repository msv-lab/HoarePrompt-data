The function `readList` is intended to read input data for multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the length of an array a, and an integer x representing a target value for bitwise operations. The array a consists of n integers, each within the range [0, 2^30 - 1]. The function should handle up to 10^4 test cases, with the total sum of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^5.
