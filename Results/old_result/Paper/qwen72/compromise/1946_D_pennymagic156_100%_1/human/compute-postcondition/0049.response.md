The only objects in the loop head are the variable `val` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least two elements, `val` is the second element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and if `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `val` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and if `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
