Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and contains at least three elements, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.***
