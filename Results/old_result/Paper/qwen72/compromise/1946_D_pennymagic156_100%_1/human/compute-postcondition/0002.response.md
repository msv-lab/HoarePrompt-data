Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.** 

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `t` and `ans`. `t` is set to an empty list, and `ans` is set to -1. The values of `n` and `x` remain as they were updated by `func_3()`, and `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).
