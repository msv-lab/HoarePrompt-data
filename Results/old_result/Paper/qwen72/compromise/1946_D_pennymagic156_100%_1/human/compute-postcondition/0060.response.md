Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If the bit at position 29 of `x` (`u`) is 0, `a` becomes an empty list, `t` contains the results of `ai` being reset to 0 whenever `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`. If `u` is 1, the sum of the bits at position 29 of each element in `a` (`v`) is 0. If `v` is odd, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. If `v` is even, `op` is the result of XORing the most significant bit (bit 29) of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the count of how many times `op` was 0 after processing each element in `a`, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
