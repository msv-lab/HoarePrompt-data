#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from stdin, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the user's input, where each integer is separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, where the input consists of integers separated by spaces. The function then converts this input into a list of integers and returns this list. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list of integers, which can be used for further processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. After the function concludes, the program has obtained an integer input from the user and returned it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that yields integer values from the input provided by the user, where the input is split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns an iterator that yields these integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has an iterator ready to yield integer values from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and returns the resulting string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed, has been returned.

    #State: `i` is -1, `u` is `x >> -1 & 1` (which is 0), `v` is `sum([(val >> -1 & 1) for val in a])` (which is 0). The list `a` may have been modified based on the operations within the loop, but its final state depends on the specific values of `x` and the elements in `a`. The list `t` is an empty list. The variable `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, or -1 if no such value was found. The length of the list `a` is the number of elements currently in `a` after any modifications.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `x`, both less than \(2^{30}\). It iterates through the bits of `x` and modifies `a` based on certain conditions. The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified list `a`. `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a specific bit pattern matching `x` during the iteration, or -1 if no such pattern is found. If no valid pattern is found and the list `a` is empty, the function returns -1.
