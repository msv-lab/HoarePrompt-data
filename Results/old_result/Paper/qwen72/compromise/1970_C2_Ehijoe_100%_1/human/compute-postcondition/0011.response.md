Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains `n-1` edges added to the graph, `start` is the input integer, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one edge connected to them, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` assigns the result of the function `func_1` to the variable `moves`.
- `func_1` is called with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided snippet, we cannot determine the exact value of `moves`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `edges`, `empty`, `leaves`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
- The output state includes the updated value of `moves` and retains the initial state of all other variables.
