Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, where 1 â‰¤ `start` â‰¤ `n`.**

The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the user input, and the initial constraints for `n` and `t` are no longer guaranteed. The dictionary `nodes` and the integer `start` remain unchanged.
