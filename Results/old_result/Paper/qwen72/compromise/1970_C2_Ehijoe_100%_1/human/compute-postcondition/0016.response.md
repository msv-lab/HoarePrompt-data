Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains `n-1` edges added to the graph, `start` is the input integer, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one edge connected to them, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is not empty, `moves` is not empty. Otherwise, `moves` is empty or False.***
