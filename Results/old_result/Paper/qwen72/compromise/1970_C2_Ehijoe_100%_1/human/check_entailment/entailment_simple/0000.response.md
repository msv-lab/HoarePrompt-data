### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played optimally, and we need to determine the winner for each starting node.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the input, constructs the tree using an adjacency list, and then determines the winner for the given starting node.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that checks if the current player (starting with Ron) can force a win from the given starting node.
   - `func_2` is the main function that reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent)`**:
     - This function checks if the current player (Ron) can force a win from the node `start`.
     - If `start` is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), the function returns `False` because the current player cannot make a move.
     - Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors of `start` (excluding the parent) to see if any of them can force a win for the opponent (Hermione). If any neighbor can force a win for Hermione, the current player (Ron) can force a win by moving to that neighbor.
     - The function returns `True` if any of the recursive calls return `False`, indicating that the current player can force a win.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
     - It reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
     - It constructs the adjacency list `nodes` from the input edges.
     - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`.
     - It reads the starting node `start` and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the adjacency list.
   - The starting node is read and used to determine the winner.
   - The output is either "Ron" or "Hermione" based on the result of `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node correctly by returning `False` in `func_1`.
   - The program also handles the case where the starting node has multiple neighbors by recursively checking each neighbor.

6. **Optimal Play**:
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly simulates the optimal play by checking if the current player can force a win by moving to a neighbor that forces the opponent to lose.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and the provided input. The logic and structure of the program align with the requirements, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.
