Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \). According to the problem description, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( 2n \). However, the program prints \( 2n \) for \( k = 4n - 2 \), which is correct, but it also prints \( 2n - 1 \) for \( k = 4n - 3 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 9
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). The program should print \( 5 \) (since \( 4n - 3 = 9 \) and \( 2n - 1 = 5 \)), but it prints \( 6 \) (since it incorrectly treats \( k = 9 \) as \( 4n - 2 \)).

This is a clear case where the program does not follow the problem description correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
