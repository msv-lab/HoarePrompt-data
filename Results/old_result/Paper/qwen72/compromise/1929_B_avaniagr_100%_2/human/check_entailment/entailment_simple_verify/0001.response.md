### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of cells to color based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - This condition is based on the observation that each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
     - This is correct because it ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover the required diagonals.
   - **Condition 2: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \), the program prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - This condition is correct because to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, which results in \( 2n - 1 \) cells.
     - This is correct because it ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover all but one diagonal.
   - **Condition 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( 2n \).
     - This condition is correct because to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, but the intersection cell is counted twice, so we need \( 2n \) cells.
     - This is correct because it ensures that the minimum number of cells is used to cover all diagonals.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**
     - \( 4 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 \) (True)
     - \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( 3 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 \) (True)
     - \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**
     - \( 10 = 4 \times 3 - 2 \) (True)
     - \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**
     - \( 9 = 4 \times 3 - 3 \) (True)
     - \( 2 \times 3 - 1 = 5 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**
     - \( 7 \leq 4 \times 4 - 4 \) (True)
     - \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**
     - \( 11 \leq 4 \times 7 - 4 \) (True)
     - \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( 3 \leq 4 \times 2 - 4 \) (True)
     - \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
     - This is correct as shown in the problem statement.
