### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the frequencies of the two firework installations and the visibility duration of each firework.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The program calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it, storing the result in `mn`. This is intended to find the time when the first firework from either installation will still be visible.
   - The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If this condition is met, it adds 1 to the result, otherwise, it does not.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is either `mn // a + mn // b + 1` or `mn // a + mn // b`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of `mn` Calculation:**
  - The calculation `mn = min(a, b) + m` is intended to find the time when the first firework from either installation will still be visible. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.
  - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the times when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The visibility duration `m` should then be used to determine how many fireworks are visible at those times.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1` is incorrect. It checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, but this is not relevant to the problem. The problem is about finding the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks, not about the divisibility of `m`.

- **Output Calculation:**
  - The output calculation `mn // a + mn // b + 1` or `mn // a + mn // b` is also incorrect. It does not account for the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`.

### Correct Approach:

To find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks, we need to:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m`.
3. Add the number of fireworks launched by both installations at the same time (i.e., at multiples of the LCM).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
