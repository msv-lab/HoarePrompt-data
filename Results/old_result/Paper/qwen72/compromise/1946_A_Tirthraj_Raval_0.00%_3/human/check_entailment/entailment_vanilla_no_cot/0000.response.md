Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in calculating the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the array and prints that count, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        next_median = median + 1
        operations = 0
        
        # Find the minimum number of operations to increase the median
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
            else:
                break
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily find the median.
2. **Finding the Median**: The median is the element at index \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) in the sorted array.
3. **Next Median**: The next median is the current median plus 1.
4. **Counting Operations**: Starting from the median index, count the number of operations required to make each element at least equal to the next median. Stop counting once you encounter an element that is already greater than or equal to the next median.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
