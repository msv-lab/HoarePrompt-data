Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer.**
