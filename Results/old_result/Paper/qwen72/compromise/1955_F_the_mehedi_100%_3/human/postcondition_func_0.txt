The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a list of four integers. For each test case, it calculates a count based on the following rules: it adds 1 to the count if the first three integers in the list are all odd, and then adds the floor division of each integer in the list by 2 to the count. The function prints the count for each test case and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the printed counts for all test cases.
