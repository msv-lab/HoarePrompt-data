### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Initial XOR Calculation:**
   - The initial XOR of the sequence depends on the counts of each number (1, 2, 3, 4).
   - The XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - Therefore, the XOR of pairs of the same number is zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence becomes zero.
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, the initial XOR is non-zero. Eve can remove one of these numbers to make the XOR zero, and Bob wins.
   - For each pair of the same number (1, 2, 3, or 4), removing one number will not change the XOR (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)).
   - Removing a number from an even count will not change the XOR from zero to non-zero.

5. **Counting Bob's Wins:**
   - If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, Bob wins once initially.
   - For each pair of the same number (1, 2, 3, or 4), removing one number will not change the XOR from zero to non-zero, so Bob can win for each pair.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It checks if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd and increments the win count by 1 if true.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the win count, which effectively counts the number of pairs for each number.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Check for All Odd Counts:**
  - The condition `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` correctly checks if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd.
  - If true, it increments `cnt` by 1, which is correct because removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

- **Counting Pairs:**
  - The loop `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` correctly counts the number of pairs for each number (1, 2, 3, 4).
  - This is because `math.floor(x / 2)` gives the number of pairs in `x` (since each pair of the same number XORs to zero).

- **Output:**
  - The program prints `cnt` for each test case, which is the total number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. It accounts for the initial win if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd and then counts the pairs of each number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
