Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will hold the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the `nums` list and the last element of the `nums` list. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
