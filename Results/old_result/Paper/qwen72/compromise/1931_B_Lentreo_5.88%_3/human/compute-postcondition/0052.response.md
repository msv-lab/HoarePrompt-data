The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `nums`, so the state of `i` will be adjusted to the next element in the list for the loop to execute one more time. The list `nums` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again, as the first element has already been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `nums`, and `last` was the last element of `nums`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least two elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the second element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.**
