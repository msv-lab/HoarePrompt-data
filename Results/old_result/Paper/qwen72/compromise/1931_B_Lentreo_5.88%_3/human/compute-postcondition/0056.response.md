Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least three elements, `last` is the second element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element of `nums`, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.
- If `i` is not 0, `curr` will change based on the calculation `i - last`.
- If `i` is 0, `curr` will remain 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, `i`) retain their initial values or conditions.
