Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the first element in `nums` and the current value of `i` is not 0, `curr` is `i - last`.**

The value of `curr` is updated to be the difference between the first element `i` and the last element `last` of the `nums` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
