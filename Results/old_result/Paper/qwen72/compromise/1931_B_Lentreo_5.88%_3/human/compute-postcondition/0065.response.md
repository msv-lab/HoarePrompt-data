The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by `n`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically such a function would return a result based on these inputs. Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the function likely processes these inputs to return a specific value or result.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and 10^9, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
