Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the program retains this state. If `curr` is not 0, the program retains the state with `curr` being non-zero.***
