The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` is not empty. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and `curr` is 0, but these details are not directly relevant to the loop head. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `nums` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the first element in `nums`, `curr` is 0**
