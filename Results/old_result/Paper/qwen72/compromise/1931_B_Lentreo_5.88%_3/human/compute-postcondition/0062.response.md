The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is a placeholder (its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `last` is the last element of the `nums` list.
   - `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`.
   - `curr` is not equal to 0.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, or `curr`.

Output: **NO**
