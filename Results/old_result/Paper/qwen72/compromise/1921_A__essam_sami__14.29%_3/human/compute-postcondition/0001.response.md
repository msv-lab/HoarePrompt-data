The only objects in the loop head are the variables `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `steps` is automatically initialized by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust it. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0**
