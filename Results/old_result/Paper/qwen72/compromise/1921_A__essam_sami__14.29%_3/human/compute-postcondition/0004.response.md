Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the user input, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of two squares. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between the corresponding corners of the two squares and prints the minimum of these squared distances. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. **
