You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from the user input, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of two squares. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between the corresponding corners of the two squares and prints the minimum of these squared distances. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then compares these distances to determine the area of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the points are correctly identified as the corners of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will output 8. This is because the program calculates the squared distance between (0, 0) and (2, 2) (which is 8) and between (0, 2) and (2, 0) (which is also 8), and then prints the smaller of these two values, which is still 8.

The correct approach would be to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points that are not on the same diagonal. This can be done by checking the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then using the larger of these differences to calculate the area.
