### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the coordinates of the four corners of a square.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We need to calculate the area of the square.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

3. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of a square can be determined by the distance between any two adjacent corners.
   - Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between two adjacent corners is either the difference in the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates.
   - The program calculates two distances:
     - `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`
     - `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`
   - These distances are squared distances between two points, but since the sides are parallel to the axes, the squared distance should be the sum of the squares of the differences in x and y coordinates.
   - However, for a square with sides parallel to the axes, the squared distance between two adjacent corners should be the square of the side length.

4. **Checking the Distances:**
   - The program compares `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one.
   - This approach is incorrect because the distances `n` and `x` are not necessarily the distances between adjacent corners. They could be the distances between any two points, which might not be the side length of the square.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the side length of the square, we should calculate the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.
   - The side length of the square is the maximum of the absolute differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - The area of the square is the square of this side length.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. It uses an incorrect method to determine the side length by comparing squared distances between arbitrary points, which may not be the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
