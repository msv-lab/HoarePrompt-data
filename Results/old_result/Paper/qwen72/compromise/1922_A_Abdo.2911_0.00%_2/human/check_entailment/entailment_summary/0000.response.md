### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The function constructs a template based on the strings `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), which is a lowercase letter.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i].upper()`, which is an uppercase letter. This ensures that `a` and `b` can both match the template.

2. **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template. For a lowercase template character, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as the template character.
   - For an uppercase template character, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If either `a` or `b` fails to match the template, `match_a_b` is set to `False`.

3. **Matching `c` to the Template**:
   - The function checks if `c` matches the template. For a lowercase template character, `c[i]` must be the same as the template character.
   - For an uppercase template character, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If `c` matches the template, `match_c` is set to `False`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - The function prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly constructs the template based on the given rules.
- It correctly checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
- It correctly checks if `c` does not match the template.
- The logic for determining the template and matching the strings is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary. It correctly handles the construction of the template and the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
