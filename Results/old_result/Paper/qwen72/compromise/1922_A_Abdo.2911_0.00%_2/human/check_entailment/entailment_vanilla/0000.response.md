### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `t` based on the following rules:
     - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to that character.
     - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of the character from `a`.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - If the template character at position `i` is lowercase, it must match the corresponding character in `a` and `b`.
     - If the template character at position `i` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` and `b` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Matching Check for `c`:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the template character at position `i` is lowercase, `c` must not match it.
     - If the template character at position `i` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.

5. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should be the same lowercase character. If they are different, the template should be an uppercase character that is not the lowercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

- **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
  - The check for `a` and `b` matching the template is correct. The program ensures that if the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match it. If the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character.

- **Matching Check for `c`:**
  - The check for `c` not matching the template is incorrect. The program should ensure that if the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match it. If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must not be the lowercase version of the template character. However, the current implementation breaks the loop as soon as it finds a mismatch, which is correct, but it should also ensure that `c` does not match the template in all positions.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because the matching check for `c` is flawed. It should ensure that `c` does not match the template in all positions, not just break the loop as soon as it finds a mismatch.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed matching check for `c`. The corrected program ensures that `c` does not match the template in all positions, which is necessary for the problem's requirements.
