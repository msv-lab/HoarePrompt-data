### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which is intended to count the number of sequences of `k` unique characters.
   - It uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of the first `k` characters in the current sequence.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current sequence, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - The program then resets `cur` to 0 to start a new sequence.
   - After processing the string `s`, if `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Use of Bitmask:** The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not correctly handle the construction of subsequences of length `n`.
   - **Subsequence Check:** The program does not check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. Instead, it only counts the number of sequences of `k` unique characters, which is not the same as checking all subsequences.
   - **String Construction:** The string construction logic in the 'NO' case is flawed. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print 'NO' and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly constructs the string in the 'NO' case.

Correctness: **False**
