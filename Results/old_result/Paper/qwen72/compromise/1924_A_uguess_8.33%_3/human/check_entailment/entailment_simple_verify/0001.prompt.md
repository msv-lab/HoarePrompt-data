You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` for all iterations, `cur` is 0 if the loop has reset it due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a' for the last iteration, `ans` is a string that, if `cnt` is less than `n`, consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by the character `tmp` (which is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0), and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is not modified, and the program prints 'YES' for each iteration where `cnt` >= `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which will count the number of valid subsequences.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which is a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
     - Checks if the character is not already in the current subsequence using the bitmask.
     - If the character is not in the current subsequence, it adds it to the bitmask.
     - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters are present in the current subsequence. It increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `cnt < n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence, but it does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:` is used to check if the current character is not in the subsequence, but this does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.
   - The program constructs a string that is not a subsequence in a way that may not always be correct. For example, it only checks the last character in the bitmask and appends 'a' to the rest, which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print 'NO' and the non-subsequence string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print 'YES'.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. It uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence but does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked. Additionally, the way it constructs a non-subsequence string may not always be correct.
