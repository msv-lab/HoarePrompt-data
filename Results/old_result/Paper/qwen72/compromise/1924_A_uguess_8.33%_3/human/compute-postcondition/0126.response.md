Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `cnt` is increased by 1.**
