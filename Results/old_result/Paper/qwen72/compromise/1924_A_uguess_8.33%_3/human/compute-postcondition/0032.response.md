Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a combination of characters in `s` that set all bits in `cur` to 1 (i.e., `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`), and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.**
