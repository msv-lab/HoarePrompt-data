Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `c`, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp`.
- The initial value of `i` is 2.
- `ord('a')` is 97, so `ord('a') + i` is 97 + 2 = 99.
- `chr(99)` is the character `c`.
- The values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged.
