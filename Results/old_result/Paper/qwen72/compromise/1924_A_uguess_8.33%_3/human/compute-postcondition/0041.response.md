Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the value of the character at the position `ord('a') + i` to `tmp`. Since `i` is 1, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `ord('a') + 1`, which is the ASCII value of 'b'. Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'b'. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition about the bit at position `i` in `cur` is no longer relevant because `tmp` is explicitly assigned a new value.
