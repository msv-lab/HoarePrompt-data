The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + 0)` if the bit at position `0` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
