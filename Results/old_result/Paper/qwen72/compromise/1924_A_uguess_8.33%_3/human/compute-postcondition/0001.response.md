The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state provided ensures that `t` is within the valid range (1 <= t <= 10^5), so no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, the loop variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0**
