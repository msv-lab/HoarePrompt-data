The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is an input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a combination of characters in `s` that set all bits in `cur` to 1 (i.e., `cur` becomes \((1 << k) - 1\)).
- `cur` is 0 if `cur` has been reset due to reaching \((1 << k) - 1\), otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
