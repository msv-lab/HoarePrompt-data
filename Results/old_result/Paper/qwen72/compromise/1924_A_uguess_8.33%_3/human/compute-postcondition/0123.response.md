Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a'.** 

For example, if `ss` is 'b', then `cur_ss` would be 1 (since the ASCII code of 'b' is 98 and the ASCII code of 'a' is 97, and 98 - 97 = 1).
