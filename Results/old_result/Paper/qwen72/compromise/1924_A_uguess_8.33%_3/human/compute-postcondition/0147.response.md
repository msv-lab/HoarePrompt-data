Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` and is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` if the bit at position `k-1` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by `tmp`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is `k-1`.**
