You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s` for all iterations, `cur` is 0 if the loop has reset it due to reaching `(1 << k) - 1` in the last iteration, otherwise `cur` is the bitwise OR of the differences between the ASCII values of the characters in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a' for the last iteration, `ans` is a string that, if `cnt` is less than `n`, consists of `cnt` repetitions of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, followed by the character `tmp` (which is the last character in the alphabet that has a corresponding bit in `cur` set to 0), and then `(n - cnt - 1)` repetitions of the character `'a'`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is not modified, and the program prints 'YES' for each iteration where `cnt` >= `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. If the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases exceeds 10^6, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
