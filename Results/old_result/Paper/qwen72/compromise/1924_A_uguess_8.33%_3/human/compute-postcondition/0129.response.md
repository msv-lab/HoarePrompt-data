Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is the number of times the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`.
- For each character, the loop checks if the bit corresponding to the character's position in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.) is set in the variable `cur`.
- If the bit is not set, it sets the bit.
- If `cur` becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that all `k` bits are set, indicating that the loop has encountered a sequence of `k` unique characters.
- When this happens, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is reset to 0 to start counting a new sequence of unique characters.
- The loop continues until all characters in `s` have been processed.
- After the loop finishes, `cur` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 every time it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.
- The variable `cnt` will hold the total number of sequences of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
