Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.***
