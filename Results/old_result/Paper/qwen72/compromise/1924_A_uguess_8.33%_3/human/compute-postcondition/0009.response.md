Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << (ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a'), `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its initial value of 0. This means `cur` now has the value `1 << cur_ss`.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. Since `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` remains the same.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`) retain their initial values or properties.
