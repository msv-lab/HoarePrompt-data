Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to (1 << k) - 1, `cnt` is 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged.***
