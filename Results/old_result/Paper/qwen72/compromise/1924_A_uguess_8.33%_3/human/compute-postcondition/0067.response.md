Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is `cur` + 2^`cur_ss`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. This operation is equivalent to adding `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss` to `cur`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `cur` is not specified, so it is represented as `cur` in the output state.
- The value of `cur` after the operation is `cur` + 2^`cur_ss`.
