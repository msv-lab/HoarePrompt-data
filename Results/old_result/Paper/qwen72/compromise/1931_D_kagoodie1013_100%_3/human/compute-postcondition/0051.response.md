Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `r_x` is assigned the value of `-num % x`.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`, so `r_x` is calculated based on this value.
- The other variables and the `test_cases` list remain unchanged.
- The value of `r_x` is now the result of the expression `-num % x`.
