Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and an integer y (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have `n` elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `arr` that have the same residues when divided by `x` and `y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of residues `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times this pair of residues appears in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`. `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements. `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have appeared more than once in the list `arr`, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`. `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times this tuple has appeared in the list `arr`. `results` is a list that now includes the value of `count` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `arr` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in `arr`, `results` is a list that now includes the value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
