Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `results` list contains the value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` value represents the total number of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `test_cases` list will still contain the same tuples it started with. The `results` list will have one integer for each tuple in `test_cases`, where each integer is the count of pairs of elements in the corresponding `arr` list that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The `residue_map` dictionary will not be part of the final output state, as it is only used within the loop for each tuple and is reset for each new tuple.
