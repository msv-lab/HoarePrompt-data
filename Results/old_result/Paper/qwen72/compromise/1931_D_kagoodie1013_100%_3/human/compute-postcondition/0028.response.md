Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- `r_x` is assigned the value of `-num % x`.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged.
- `r_x` is calculated as the negative of `num` modulo `x`. This means `r_x` will be a non-negative integer less than `x`, representing the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
