The only objects in the loop head are the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple, and the tuple must contain the required elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), an integer `y` (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and a list of `n` integers `arr` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases` where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**
