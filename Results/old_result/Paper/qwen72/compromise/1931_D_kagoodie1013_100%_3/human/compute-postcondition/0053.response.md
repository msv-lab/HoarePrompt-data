Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` attempts to increment `count` by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the dictionary `residue_map`.
- Since `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, the key `(r_x, r_y)` does not exist.
- The `get` method returns `0` when the key is not found.
- Therefore, `count` remains `0` after the execution of the code snippet.
- All other variables and the state of `test_cases` remain unchanged.
