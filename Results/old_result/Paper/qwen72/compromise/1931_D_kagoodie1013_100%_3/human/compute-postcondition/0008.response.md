Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple (`num % x`, `num % y`).**

Explanation:
- `current_key` is assigned the value of a tuple containing `num % x` and `num % y`.
- `num` is the first element in `arr`.
- `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
