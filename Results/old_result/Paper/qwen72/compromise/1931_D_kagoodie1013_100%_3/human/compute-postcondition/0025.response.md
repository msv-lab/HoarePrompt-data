Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have `n` elements, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of residues `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the count of how many times this pair of residues appears in `arr`.**
