Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array a).

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs and a `residue_map` dictionary to store the counts of pairs with specific residues modulo x and y.

3. **Residue Calculation**: For each number in the array, it calculates:
   - `r_x` as the negative residue of the number modulo x (`-num % x`).
   - `r_y` as the positive residue of the number modulo y (`num % y`).

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to the `count` variable. This is because if a pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists, it means there is a previous number in the array that, when combined with the current number, forms a beautiful pair.

5. **Updating Residue Map**: It updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues modulo x and y (`num % x` and `num % y`).

6. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic ensures that all pairs are considered, and the use of the `residue_map` efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs without needing to check every possible pair explicitly, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays. The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
