### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the criteria provided. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` when divided by `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` when divided by `y`.

3. **Pair Counting:**
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map` and adds the corresponding count to the `count` variable.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array for a test case, the `count` value is appended to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`. This ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met: `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

- **Pair Counting:**
  - The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues, which is an efficient way to count pairs that meet the criteria.
  - The `count` variable is correctly incremented by the number of times the current residue tuple has been seen before.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the constraints well, including the large number of test cases and the large size of the array.
  - It correctly processes the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The use of a dictionary to store and count residues is efficient and appropriate for the problem. The program also handles the input and output correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
