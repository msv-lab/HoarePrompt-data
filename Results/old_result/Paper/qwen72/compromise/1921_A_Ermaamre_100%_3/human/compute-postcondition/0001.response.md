The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of the list of test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the squares are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and `_` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
