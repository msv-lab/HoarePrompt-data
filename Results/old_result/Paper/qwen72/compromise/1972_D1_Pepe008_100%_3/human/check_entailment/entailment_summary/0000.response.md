Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the program and analyze its logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculation of `suma`:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - If \(x > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula for \(x\):**
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Additional Check:**
   - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem's conditions.

3. **Subtracting 2 from `suma`:**
   - Subtracting 2 from `suma` is arbitrary and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The formula used and the additional checks are incorrect, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 from `suma` is not justified.

Correctness: **False**
