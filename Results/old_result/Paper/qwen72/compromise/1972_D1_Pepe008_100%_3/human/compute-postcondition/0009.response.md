Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `suma` is now equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Additionally, the current value of `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2` is 0, and the current value of `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2` is 0.**
