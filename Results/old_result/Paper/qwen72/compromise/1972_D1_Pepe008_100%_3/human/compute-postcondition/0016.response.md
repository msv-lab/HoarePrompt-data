Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is `suma + x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `n` and `m` being positive integers within the specified range, `T` being greater than 0, `t` being 0, `a` being the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` being at least 1, `i` being incremented by 1, and `x` being calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).
- The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1.
- Since `suma` was initially `suma + x`, after the increment, `suma` becomes `suma + x + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the update to `suma`.
