Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The new value of `x` is calculated using the updated value of `i`.
