The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, and the loop depends on the variable `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1, and `T` must still be greater than `t`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\)**
