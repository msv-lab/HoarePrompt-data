Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is a positive integer, `t` is \(T - 1\), `info` is a list of strings from the last input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop for each iteration, where `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all \(T\) iterations, the variables `n` and `m` remain within their initial bounds. The variable `T` is a positive integer, and `t` is \(T - 1\), indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The variable `info` contains the last input read, and `a` and `b` are the integer values extracted from the last input. The variable `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated for each iteration of the inner loop, where `x` is computed as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where both \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2\) are zero.
