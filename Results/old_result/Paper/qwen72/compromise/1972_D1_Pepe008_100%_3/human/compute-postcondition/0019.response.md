To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `t` is 0
- `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`
- `b` is at least 1
- `i` is `i + 1`
- \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) is the condition that must hold for the loop to continue

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. This means that if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `1` to `b + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is increased by 1, so if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`.
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will start with `i` being `i + 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` and `m` remain the same.
- `T` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) must hold for the loop to continue.**
