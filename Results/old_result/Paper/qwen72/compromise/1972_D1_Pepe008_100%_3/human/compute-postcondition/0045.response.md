The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `b` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1\), `i` is 2, `b` must be greater than or equal to 2**
