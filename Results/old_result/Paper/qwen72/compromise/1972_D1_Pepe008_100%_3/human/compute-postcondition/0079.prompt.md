Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
            suma += x
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                suma += 1
    print(suma - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) for each `i` from 1 to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
