Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\), `i` is 1, `x` is \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\)**

Explanation:
- `x` is calculated as \((a - 1) // 1 + 1\), which simplifies to \(a\).
- `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value (which was 0), so `suma` becomes \(a\).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains 1.
- `x` is now equal to \(a\).
