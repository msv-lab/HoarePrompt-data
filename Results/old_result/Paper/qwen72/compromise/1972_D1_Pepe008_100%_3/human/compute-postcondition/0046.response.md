Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\), `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
