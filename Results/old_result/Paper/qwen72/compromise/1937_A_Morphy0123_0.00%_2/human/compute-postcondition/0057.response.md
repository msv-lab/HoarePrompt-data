Output State: **`n_cases` is 0, `i` is `n_cases - 1`, and `n` is an input integer for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\) where `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). If `power` is equal to `n`, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\). Otherwise, the output is \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\).**

### Explanation:
- **`n_cases` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `n_cases` is decremented to 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
- **`i` is `n_cases - 1`**: The loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n_cases - 1` after the last iteration, as the loop runs from `0` to `n_cases - 1`.
- **`n` is an input integer for each test case**: For each test case, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, and the loop processes this value to determine the output.
- **Output for each test case**:
  - If `n` is 1, the output is 1.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, the loop calculates `power` as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
  - If `power` is equal to `n`, the output is \(2^{\text{power}}\).
  - Otherwise, the output is \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\).

This output state describes the final condition of the loop and the results produced for each test case.
