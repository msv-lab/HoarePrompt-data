The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the variable `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, as this will ensure that the loop runs at least once. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and starts at 0.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
