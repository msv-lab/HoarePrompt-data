Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is an input integer, and its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
2. **`power`**: According to the initial state, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). However, the initial state also states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. This means that `power` is set to `n` before the print statement is executed.
3. **`2 ** power`**: This expression calculates \(2^{\text{power}}\), where `power` is currently equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output \(2^{\text{n}}\), where `n` is the input integer.

### Output:
Output: **2 ** n (where n is the input integer)**
