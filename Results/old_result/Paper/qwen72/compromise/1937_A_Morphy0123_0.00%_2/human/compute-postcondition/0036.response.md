Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\).
- `power` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `power`**:
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\).
   - This means that \(2^{\text{power} - 1}\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 10, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 10 is 16, which is \(2^4\). Therefore, `power` would be 5 because \(2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16\).

2. **Calculating `2 ** power`**:
   - Once `power` is determined, the code snippet `print(2 ** power)` will print \(2^{\text{power}}\).
   - Using the example where `n` is 10 and `power` is 5, the output will be \(2^5 = 32\).

### Final Output:
The code will print \(2^{\text{power}}\), where `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\).

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power} - 1} \geq n\))**
