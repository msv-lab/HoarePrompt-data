Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the input integer provided.
- The initial state specifies that `n_cases` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, which remain unchanged.
- The value of `power` is not affected by the code snippet, so it remains unchanged.
- The conditions related to `power` (whether it remains unchanged or is calculated based on `n`) are not executed in this code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
