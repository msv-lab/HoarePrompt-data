The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `n_cases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `power`. If `n` is greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the same. Otherwise, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
