The value of `power` is decremented by 1. Since `power` was the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\), after decrementing, `power` is now the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\). The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power)}\), `power` is the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\), and `power` is not equal to `n`**.
