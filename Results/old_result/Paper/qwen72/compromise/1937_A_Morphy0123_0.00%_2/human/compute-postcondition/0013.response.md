Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial condition that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 remains unchanged because these variables are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
- The condition `log2(n) > power - 1` must hold true for the loop to have executed the final time, ensuring that `power` was incremented to the point where it is no longer less than `log2(n)`.
