Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`.
   - `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`.
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`.
   - Since `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`, it is effectively the floor of `log2(n) - 1` rounded up to the nearest integer.

3. **Calculating `2 ** power`:**
   - `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to the power of `power`.
   - Given that `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`, we can express `power` as \(\lceil \log_2(n) - 1 \rceil\).
   - Therefore, `2 ** power` will be \(2^{\lceil \log_2(n) - 1 \rceil}\).

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n` is 8.
   - `log2(8)` is 3.
   - `log2(8) - 1` is 2.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2, which is 2.
   - `2 ** power` is \(2^2\), which is 4.

5. **General Case:**
   - For any `n` greater than 2, `log2(n)` will be a value greater than 1.
   - `log2(n) - 1` will be a value greater than 0.
   - `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to this value.
   - `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to this integer value.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will output the value of \(2\) raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(n) - 1)**
