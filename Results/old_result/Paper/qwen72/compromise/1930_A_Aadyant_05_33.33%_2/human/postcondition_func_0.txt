The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from user input, sorts the list, and sums every other element starting from the first one. It then appends this sum to a list `out`. After processing all test cases, it prints each sum in `out` to the console. The function does not return any value.
