You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. It then calculates the number of groups of three sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The result is printed to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters, does not return any value, and does not modify any external state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the frequency of each stick length in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length, the program calculates how many polygons can be formed using sticks of that length. It does this by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (`x // 3`), which is the minimum number of sides required to form a regular polygon (a triangle).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Polygon Calculation:**
  - The program assumes that any group of sticks of the same length can form a regular polygon if the count is at least 3. However, this is not always correct. For example, if you have 4 sticks of the same length, you can form a square, which is a regular polygon with 4 sides, not just 1 triangle.
  - The correct approach should be to divide the count of each stick length by the number of sides of the largest possible regular polygon that can be formed with that count.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique stick length, the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed is `x // k`, where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon. The largest possible regular polygon that can be formed with `x` sticks is a polygon with `x // 3` sides, but this should be adjusted to the largest possible `k` such that `k * (k-2) / 2` is an integer and `x >= k`.

### Conclusion:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides. It only counts the number of triangles that can be formed, which is not the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness:
**False**
