Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through a series of queries and responses. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a complete undirected graph from which (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make at most n queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to the interactor, and must output a Hamiltonian path for each test case. The interactor is non-adaptive, meaning the graph does not change during the interaction.**
