Postcondition: **`ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus `v1`, `v1` is the first value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is the second value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0**
