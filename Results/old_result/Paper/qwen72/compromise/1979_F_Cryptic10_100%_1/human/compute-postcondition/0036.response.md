Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and possibly `v1` if `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `p2` is a list that may contain `v1` if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` from the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are assigned from the first tuple in the original `ops` list, and `v1` is appended to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.**

Explanation:
- If `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `vx` and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` are still assigned from the first tuple in `ops`.
- The lists `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the condition.
