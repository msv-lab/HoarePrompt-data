Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `p1`, `p2`, `ops`, `v1`, `v2`, and `vx` are updated accordingly, but the preconditions for `p1`, `p2`, `ops`, `v1`, `v2`, and `vx` remain valid.
