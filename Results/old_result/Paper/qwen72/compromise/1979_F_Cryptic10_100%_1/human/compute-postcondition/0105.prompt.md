Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ops` is either empty or contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it. `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus `v1` and, if applicable, `v3`. `v1` is the first value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v2` is the second value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and `_` is the second value returned by `q(0)` but is not used.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `vx` contains at least 2 elements. If `v2` <= 0, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `vx` contains at least 1 element, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`. In both cases, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, and `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` in addition to any existing tuples. If `v2` <= 0, `v3` has been removed from `vx`, `v3` is now 0, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to any existing tuples.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
