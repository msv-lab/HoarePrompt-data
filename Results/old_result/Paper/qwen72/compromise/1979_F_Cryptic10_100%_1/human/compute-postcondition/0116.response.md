The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates in an interactive environment where it can make queries to an interactor. The function must handle multiple test cases, each involving a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and (n - 2) edges removed. The function can make at most `n` queries of the form "? d" (where 0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to the interactor to gather information about the graph. After processing the information, the function must output a Hamiltonian path for each test case.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to handle multiple test cases, each involving a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices and (n - 2) edges removed. It can make at most `n` queries to the interactor to determine the structure of the graph and must return a Hamiltonian path for each test case.**
