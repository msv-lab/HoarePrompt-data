Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`. `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` must contain at least three tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to `p1` if the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is not equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2` instead.
- The initial state specifies that `p1` contains the elements of `vx`, `p2` is empty, `ops` contains at least three tuples, and `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
- The set `vx` has at most 2 elements left, and this remains unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated lists `p1` and `p2` based on the condition, while maintaining the other initial conditions.
