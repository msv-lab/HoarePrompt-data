### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Loop:**
   - The program starts by iterating through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the range from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `ans1` such that `p[ans1]` is the maximum value in the permutation. This is done by comparing `p[ans1] | p[ans1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` for each `i` in the range. If `p[i]` is greater, `ans1` is updated to `i`.

2. **Second Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It then iterates through the range from 1 to `n-1` to find indices `i` such that `p[i] | p[ans1]` is equal to `p[mx] | p[ans1]`. If `p[i] | p[ans1]` is less than `p[mx] | p[ans1]`, `mx` is updated to `i` and `v` is reset to a list containing `i`. If `p[i] | p[ans1]` is equal to `p[mx] | p[ans1]`, `i` is appended to `v`.

3. **Final Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mx` and `ans` to the first element of `v`.
   - It then iterates through the list `v` to find the index `ans` such that `p[ans] | p[ans]` is the maximum among all elements in `v`. If `p[v[i]] | p[v[i]]` is greater than `p[ans] | p[ans]`, `ans` is updated to `v[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the final answer.

### Analysis:

- **Query Validity:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly formats and prints the query string `? a b c d` and reads the response from the interactor.
  - The queries are valid as they always use indices within the range `[0, n-1]`.

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
  - The final loop makes at most `len(v) - 1` queries, where `len(v)` is at most `n`.
  - The total number of queries is at most `3n - 3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Finding Maximum XOR:**
  - The program correctly identifies the index `ans1` where `p[ans1]` is the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices `i` such that `p[i] | p[ans1]` is equal to the maximum value found in the first loop.
  - The final loop correctly identifies the index `ans` such that `p[ans] | p[ans]` is the maximum among the indices in `v`.

- **Output Validity:**
  - The program outputs the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the final answer, which is a valid pair of indices.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly follow the problem description and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries and correctly identifies a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.
