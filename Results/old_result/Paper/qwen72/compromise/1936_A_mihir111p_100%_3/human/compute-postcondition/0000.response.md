The `print` statement will output a string that includes the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. According to the initial state, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers, each of which is less than `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified in the initial state, the output will include these variables in their symbolic form, indicating that they are non-negative integers less than `n`.

Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)**
