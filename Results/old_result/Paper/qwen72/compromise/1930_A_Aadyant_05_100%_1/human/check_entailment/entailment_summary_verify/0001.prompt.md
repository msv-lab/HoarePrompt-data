You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of lists to process. For each of the `n` lists, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). It stores these sums in a list `final` and then prints each sum on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `final` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the sum of the sorted even-indexed elements from the corresponding input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers (i.e., `n`).
   - It then reads the next line of input, which contains the `2n` integers, and splits this line into a list of strings `list1`.
   - It converts each string in `list1` to an integer and appends it to `list2`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The program sorts `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first.

4. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair (which is the smaller number due to sorting) to the score `s`.

5. **Storing and Printing the Results**:
   - After calculating the score for each test case, it appends the score to the `final` list.
   - Finally, it prints each score in the `final` list.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the input and processes it as described in the problem.
- The sorting step ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
- The score calculation is done by summing the first number of each pair in the sorted list, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
