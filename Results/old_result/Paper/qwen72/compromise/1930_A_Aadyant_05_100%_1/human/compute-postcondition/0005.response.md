Output State: **The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` remains an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` remains a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, and `final` remains a list of n integers where each integer is the sum of the sorted even-indexed elements from the corresponding input list. The loop has printed each element of the `final` list, one per line.**
