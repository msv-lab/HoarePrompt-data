The function `func` is expected to take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, two lines of input: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) of length `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function returns the result of processing each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function processes each test case and returns the result of the processing, but the specific output for each test case is not defined.**
