Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a good approach to efficiently count the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2 (e.g., \(2^1 + 2^1 = 2^2\), but \(2^1 + 2^2 \leq 2^3\)).

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This is correct because if there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 out of `cnt` is given by the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - The program also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. This is correct because if there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 2 out of `cnt` is \( \binom{cnt}{2} \), and then you can pair these with any of the remaining sticks (sum of counts of all other stick lengths).

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of any length by not adding to `res` in such cases.
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no valid triangles (e.g., when all stick lengths are distinct).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
