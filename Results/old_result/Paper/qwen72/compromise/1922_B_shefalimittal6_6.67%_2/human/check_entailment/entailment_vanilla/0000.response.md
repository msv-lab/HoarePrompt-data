Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is an efficient way to group the sticks by their lengths.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**: 
   - A triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2 (`2^{a_i}`), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the lengths of the three sticks are the same. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 is always less than or equal to the next power of 2, and thus cannot satisfy the triangle inequality with a larger stick.

4. **Counting Valid Triangles**:
   - The program checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - The program also checks if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and one stick from the remaining sticks using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length `2^1 = 2`.
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is `math.comb(7, 3) = 35`.
  - The program correctly outputs `35`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^3 = 8`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^1 = 2`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - There are 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of length 4 and 2.
  - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of any other length is `math.comb(2, 2) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - No three sticks have the same length, and no combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick is given, so it is impossible to form a triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly counts the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles using the given constraints and conditions.

Correctness: **True**
