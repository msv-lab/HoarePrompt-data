Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The main issues are:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take two parameters `n` and `m` as per the problem description.
2. **Variable Names**: The function reads `n` and `k` from input, but `k` should be `m` as per the problem description.
3. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**: The logic inside the function does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current logic is calculating something entirely different and does not match the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
