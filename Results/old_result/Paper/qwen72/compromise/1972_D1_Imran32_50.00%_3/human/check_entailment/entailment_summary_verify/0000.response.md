### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\), but the variable name is incorrect).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates `root` as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - It iterates over `i` from 2 to `root` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem.
   - The loop and the calculation of `ans` do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input \((2, 3)\), the correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - However, the program will not produce this output. Instead, it will calculate `ans` using the loop, which does not match the problem's logic.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A more appropriate approach would involve using the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and modular arithmetic to efficiently count the valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is performing a different calculation that does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
