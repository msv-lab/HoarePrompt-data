Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem, but the implementation does not correctly address these conditions. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, but it expects to read `n` and `k` from the input. This is not consistent with the problem's requirement to process `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Incorrect Variable Usage**: The function uses `k` but does not use it in the calculation. The problem statement mentions `m`, not `k`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirement to find pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it calculates `ans` using a formula that does not relate to the problem's conditions.

4. **Missing Core Logic**: The program does not implement the core logic required to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all pairs (a, b) within the specified ranges.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
