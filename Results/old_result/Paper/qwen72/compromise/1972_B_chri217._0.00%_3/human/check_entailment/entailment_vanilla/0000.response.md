### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a circle of `n` coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., no facing-up coins left) loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, the first player (Alice) can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn.
   - If there are an even number of facing-up coins, the second player (Bob) can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after his turn.
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player whose turn it is loses.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This means Bob will eventually be forced into a position where he cannot make a move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice. This means Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
   - If `num_up` is odd, it returns "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If `num_up` is even, it returns "NO" (Bob wins).

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins' states.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s`.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even and returns the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. The reasoning is sound, and the implementation matches the problem description.
