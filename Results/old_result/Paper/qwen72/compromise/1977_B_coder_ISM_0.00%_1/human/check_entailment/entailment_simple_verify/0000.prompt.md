You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: `x` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `nalla` is `t-1`, `i` is 30, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the final value of `flag`, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between the final value of `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29 (or 30 if `length` is 31). The list `s` has been processed to replace any occurrence of '1' followed by '1' with '-1' and '0', and any occurrence of '-1' immediately following a '1' with '0' and '-1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '1', then `s[29]` remains '1', and an additional '1' is appended to `s`, making `length` 31. If `flag` was 0, `s[29]` remains unchanged, and `length` is 30.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

For example, consider the input \(x = 14\). The expected output is an array like `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`, which satisfies all the conditions. However, the program outputs an array that does not meet this requirement. Let's break down the program's behavior:

1. The program first converts the number \(x\) to a binary representation and stores it in the list `s` as a string of '0's and '1's.
2. It then tries to adjust the array to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
3. However, the logic for adjusting the array is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the propagation of adjustments when it encounters consecutive '1's.

For \(x = 14\), the binary representation is `1110`. The program will output something like `[1, 1, 1, 0]`, which is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly propagate the adjustments to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
