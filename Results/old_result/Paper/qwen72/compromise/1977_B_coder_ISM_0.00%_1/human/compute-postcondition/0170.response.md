Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 0 (reinitialized by the loop), `length` is 30, `s` is an empty list, and `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state. The bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` (where `i` is 0) results in a non-zero value, indicating that the least significant bit of `x` is 1.**
