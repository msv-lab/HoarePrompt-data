The code snippet `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list containing either the strings `'1'` and `'1'` or a list containing the strings `'1'` or `'0'` followed by `'0'`. After appending `'0'`, the list `s` will have an additional element `'0'` at the end.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the strings '1' and '1' followed by '0' if the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, otherwise `s` is a list containing the strings '1' or '0' followed by '0' and then another '0'.**
