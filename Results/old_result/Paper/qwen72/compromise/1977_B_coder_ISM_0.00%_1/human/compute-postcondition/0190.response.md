Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. If `flag` is 1 and the first element of `s` is '0', the first element of `s` is changed to '1', and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables and the list `s` remains the same.***
