Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` and `s[3]` are both '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is true and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[2]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, `s`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
