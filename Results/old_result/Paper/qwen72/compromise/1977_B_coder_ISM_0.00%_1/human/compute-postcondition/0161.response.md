Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. If `s[29]` is '-1', then `s[29]` is '-1' and `s[28]` is '1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[29]` and `s[28]` remain unchanged.***
