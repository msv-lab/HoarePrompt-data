Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `nalla` is 1.
- `i` is 30.
- `length` is 30.
- `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29.
- The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 29.
- If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the value of `s[i]` is now '0' and the value of `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'.
- If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and `s[29]` is set to '1'.
- If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '1', then `s[29]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 0.
- If `flag` was 0, `s[29]` remains unchanged, and `flag` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(length)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `length` is explicitly given as 30 in the initial state.
- The `print` statement is simply printing the value of `length`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `length`, which is 30.

Output: **30**
