Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. The loop has processed each element in the list `s` from index 0 to 28. The 29th element of `s` is '1'.**
