Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0'. The elements of `s` represent the binary representation of `x`, with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs 30 times, from `i = 0` to `i = 29`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)`) is set. If it is, it appends '1' to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.
- After 30 iterations, `i` will be 29 (the last value it takes in the loop).
- The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each representing a bit of `x` in its binary form, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) at index 0 to the most significant bit (MSB) at index 29.
- The variables `x`, `t`, and `nalla` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
