Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', and '1'.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string '1' to the list `s`. Initially, `s` was a list containing the strings '1' and '1' if the bit at position `i` in `x` was 1, or a list containing the strings '1' or '0' followed by '0' if the bit at position `i` in `x` was 0. After appending '1', `s` will contain '1', '1', and '1' in both cases. The values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged.
