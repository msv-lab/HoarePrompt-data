Postcondition: ***`x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. If the element at index 3 in the list `s` is '-1' and the element at index 2 is '1', the element at index 3 remains '-1'. Otherwise, the element at index 3 is not '-1' or the element at index 2 is not '1'.***
