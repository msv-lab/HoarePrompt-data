Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. If `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is set to '0'. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
