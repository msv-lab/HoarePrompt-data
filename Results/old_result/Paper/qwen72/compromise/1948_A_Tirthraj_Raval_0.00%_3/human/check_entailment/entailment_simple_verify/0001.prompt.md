You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a single integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and return a string of uppercase Latin letters of length at most 200 with exactly n special characters, or "NO" if no such string exists.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and for each iteration, if the input `n` was odd, the output was 'NO'. If `n` was even, the output was 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with the total length of the string being `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (each special character must have a matching neighbor).

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a pattern of length `n` where each pair of characters is different.
   - It uses the string 'AB' to alternate between 'A' and 'B' for each pair.
   - The pattern is generated by appending characters to a list and then joining the list into a string.

4. **Output**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' followed by the generated string.
   - The generated string has exactly `n` special characters, and each special character is part of a pair (e.g., 'ABABAB' for `n = 6`).

5. **String Length**:
   - The problem specifies that the string length should be at most 200.
   - The generated string length is exactly `n`, which is within the limit since `1 \le n \le 50`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the condition for the number of special characters, generates a valid pattern, and ensures the output string length is within the specified limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
