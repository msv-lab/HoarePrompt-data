### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (each special character must have a matching neighbor).

3. **Pattern Generation**:
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a pattern of length `n` where each pair of characters is different.
   - It uses the string 'AB' to alternate between 'A' and 'B' for each pair.
   - The pattern is generated by appending characters to a list and then joining the list into a string.

4. **Output**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' followed by the generated string.
   - The generated string has exactly `n` special characters, and each special character is part of a pair (e.g., 'ABABAB' for `n = 6`).

5. **String Length**:
   - The problem specifies that the string length should be at most 200.
   - The generated string length is exactly `n`, which is within the limit since `1 \le n \le 50`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the condition for the number of special characters, generates a valid pattern, and ensures the output string length is within the specified limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
