Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for all valid cases. Specifically, the pattern generation logic is flawed. The program generates a pattern like "ABABAB..." for even `n`, but this pattern does not ensure that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, for `n = 2`, the program generates "AB", which has no special characters, instead of a valid string like "MM" which has exactly 2 special characters. 

To correct this, the pattern generation should ensure that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, such as generating a string like "AABBAABB..." for even `n`.
