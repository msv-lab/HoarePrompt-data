Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even and must be at least 4, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', and 'B', `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `i % 2` of the string 'AB' to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` is 1, so the character 'B' is appended to `pattern`. The other variables remain unchanged.
