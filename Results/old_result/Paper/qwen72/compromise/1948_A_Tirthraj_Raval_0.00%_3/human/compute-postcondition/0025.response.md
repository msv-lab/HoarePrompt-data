The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The initial state of `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head condition. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer.
- If `n` is even, `pattern` is an empty list, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` should start from 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n // 2)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` starts from 0**
