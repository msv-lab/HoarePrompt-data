The code snippet `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends a character to the list `pattern`. The character appended is determined by the value of `i % 2`, which alternates between 0 and 1 as `i` increments. Since `i` starts from 0, the first character appended will be `'A'`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` starts from 0, `pattern` is a list that now contains the character `'A'`.**
