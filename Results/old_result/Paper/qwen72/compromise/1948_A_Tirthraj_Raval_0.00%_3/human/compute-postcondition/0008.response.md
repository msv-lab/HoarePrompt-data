The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` is even). Before the loop starts, `t` being greater than 0 and `pattern` being an empty list do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is even and must be at least 2, `pattern` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
