Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the required output. The program should calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for the sorted array (or any other arrangement that maximizes the beauty) and print the maximum beauty value.

For example, given the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will print the sorted array `1 2 3`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program does not perform this calculation.
