You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are unchanged, but the sorted lists for each test case have been printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
   - The formula for beauty is: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The largest differences are obtained by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.
   - However, the given program does not calculate the beauty; it simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array and then prints the sorted elements as strings.
   - The program does not compute the beauty of the array, which is the required output.

4. **Correct Output**:
   - The correct output should be the maximum beauty of the array, not the sorted array itself.
   - The maximum beauty can be computed as follows:
     - Sort the array.
     - Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not solve the problem as described. It only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
