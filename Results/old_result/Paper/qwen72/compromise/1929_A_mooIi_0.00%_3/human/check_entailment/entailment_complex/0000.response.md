Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), after rearranging the elements of the array in any way. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it as a space-separated string. It does not compute the beauty of the array or output the maximum beauty value.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
3. Output this sum for each test case.

The current program does not perform the calculation or output the correct result. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
