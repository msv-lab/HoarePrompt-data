Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the program only sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. It does not compute or print the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Sort the array.
4. Calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
5. Print the calculated maximum beauty for each test case.

The current program fails to perform steps 4 and 5, and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the required output.

Correctness: **False**
