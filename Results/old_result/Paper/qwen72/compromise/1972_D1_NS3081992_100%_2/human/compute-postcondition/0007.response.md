Functionality: ** The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decrements `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, integer `n`, and positive integer `m` remain unchanged. The final state of `k` is an integer that has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m. **
