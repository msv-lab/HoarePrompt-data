You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of t, a, b, and c remain unchanged. The output state depends on the input values provided for each test case during the loop execution. For each test case, if a < b < c, 'STAIRS' is printed; if a < b > c, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct as the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.
4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.
5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.
6. **Output for Each Case**: The program prints "STAIRS" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if they form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise. However, the output for a stair should be "STAIR" (without the 'S' at the end) as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output for the stair condition. The correct output should be "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS".
