Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of t, a, b, and c remain unchanged. The output state depends on the input values provided for each test case during the loop execution. For each test case, if a < b < c, 'STAIRS' is printed; if a < b > c, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
