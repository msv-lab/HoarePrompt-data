Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to meet the problem requirements:

1. **Case Sensitivity in Output**: The problem specifies that the output can be "YES" or "NO" in any case (e.g., "yes", "Yes", "NO", "No"). However, the program outputs "Yes" and "No" with a lowercase 'y' and 'n', which might not be recognized as correct by the judge. It should output "YES" and "NO" in all uppercase to ensure compatibility.

2. **Deterministic Solution**: The program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string, which is not deterministic. This means that for some test cases, it might not always produce a different string, especially for strings with many repeated characters. A more reliable approach is needed to ensure that the output string is always different from the input string when possible.

3. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program does not handle single character strings correctly. For a string of length 1, it is impossible to rearrange it to a different string, so the output should always be "NO". The current program might output "Yes" and the same single character string, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Create a list of characters from the string
            s_list = list(s)
            # Swap the first two characters to ensure the string is different
            s_list[0], s_list[1] = s_list[1], s_list[0]
            s2 = ''.join(s_list)
            if s != s2:
                print('YES')
                print(s2)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Single Character String**: If the length of the string is 1, it is impossible to rearrange it, so the program directly outputs "NO".
- **Swapping Characters**: For strings of length 2 or more, the program swaps the first two characters to ensure the output string is different from the input string. This approach is deterministic and guarantees a different string if one exists.
- **Output Case**: The output is always in uppercase ("YES" and "NO") to match the problem requirements.

This corrected program should now meet the problem's requirements and handle all test cases correctly.
