### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Rearranging the String:**
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - This function ensures that all characters in `s` are used exactly once in the new string `s2`.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the newly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string `s` has all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"). In such cases, `random.sample` will always return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` has only one character (e.g., "d"). In this case, `random.sample` will return the same string, and the program will correctly print "No".

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program follows the required output format by printing "Yes" or "No" and the rearranged string `s2` when applicable.
   - The output "Yes" and "No" are case-insensitive, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement. It generates a random permutation of the string and checks if it is different from the original string, which is the required behavior.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
