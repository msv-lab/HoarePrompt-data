The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.

The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the given constraints. Since the specific output is not provided, we can infer that the function returns some form of result or solution based on the input parameters, possibly related to permutations or some other computation involving the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -n and n. The function returns a result based on these inputs, ensuring that there is at least one valid permutation for the given data.**
