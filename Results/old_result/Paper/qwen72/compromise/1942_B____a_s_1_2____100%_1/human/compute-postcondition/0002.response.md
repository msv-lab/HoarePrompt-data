Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the input integer, `n` is the last read integer from the input, and `a` is the last read list of integers from the input. The list `p` contains the computed values for the current iteration of the loop, and it is printed. The values of `mex` are not retained between iterations.**
