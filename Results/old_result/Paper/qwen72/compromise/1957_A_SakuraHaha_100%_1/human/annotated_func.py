#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of integers `a` representing the lengths of the sticks, and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks (input by the user), `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the dictionary `cnt` remains the same as in the initial state.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user, where `n` is the number of sticks and `a` contains the lengths of the sticks. It then calculates the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`. The function prints this total number and does not return any value. The values of `n`, `a`, and the dictionary `cnt` are not modified and remain unchanged after the function execution.
