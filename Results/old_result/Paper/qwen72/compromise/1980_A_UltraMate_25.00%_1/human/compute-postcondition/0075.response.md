Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If 'C' is not present in the string `s`, then `ans` is set to `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
