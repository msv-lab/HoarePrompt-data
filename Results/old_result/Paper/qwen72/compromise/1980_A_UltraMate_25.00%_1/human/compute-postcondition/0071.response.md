Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is the new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is the new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is 'B', and `ans` is `m`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 0.
- The code `ans += m` adds the value of `m` to `ans`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `m`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
