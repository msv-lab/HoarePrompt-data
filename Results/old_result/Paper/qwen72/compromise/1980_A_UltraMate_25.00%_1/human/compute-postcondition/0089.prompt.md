Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`. The variable `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer provided by the user, 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer provided by the user, 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is the second integer provided by the user, 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`. For each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these increments.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= n <= 50), `m` is a new integer provided by the user (1 <= m <= 5), `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a new non-empty string provided by the user, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a non-empty Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, `i` is the last key in `hmp` processed by the loop, `ans` is the final sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in the string `s` plus the sum of `(m - hmp[i])` for each character in `s` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
