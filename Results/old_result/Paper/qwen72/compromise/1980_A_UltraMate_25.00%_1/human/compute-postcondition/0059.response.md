To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the user, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 50.
   - `m` is the second integer provided by the user, with the constraint 1 <= m <= 5.
   - `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
   - `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user.
   - `p` is a fixed string 'ABCDEF'.
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   - `i` is the last key in the iteration order of `hmp`.
   - For each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of these increments.

2. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - For each character in `hmp`, if the frequency of the character is less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by the difference `m - hmp[i]`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - Iterate over the keys in `hmp`.
   - For each key `i`, check if `hmp[i] < m`.
   - If true, increment `ans` by `m - hmp[i]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of all increments where the frequency of a character in `s` is less than `m`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the final value of `ans` after all the necessary increments have been made.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character i in hmp with a frequency less than m)**
