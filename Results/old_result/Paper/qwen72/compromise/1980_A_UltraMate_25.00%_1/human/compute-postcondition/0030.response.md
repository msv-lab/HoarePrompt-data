To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer provided by the user, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with the constraints 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.
- `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `p` is the string 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
- `ans` is computed as follows:
  - For each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, add `m` to `ans`.
  - For each character `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, add `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Characters in 'ABCDEF' not present in `s`:**
   - If a character from 'ABCDEF' is not in `s`, it contributes `m` to `ans`.
   - For example, if `s` does not contain 'A', then `ans` increases by `m`.

2. **Characters in `s` with frequency less than `m`:**
   - For each character `i` in `s` (which is also in 'ABCDEF'), if the frequency `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` increases by `(m - hmp[i])`.
   - For example, if `s` contains 'A' twice and `m` is 3, then `ans` increases by `(3 - 2) = 1`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `s = "ABCD"`
- `m = 3`

1. **Characters in 'ABCDEF' not present in `s`:**
   - 'E' and 'F' are not in `s`.
   - Contribution to `ans`: `m + m = 3 + 3 = 6`.

2. **Characters in `s` with frequency less than `m`:**
   - 'A' appears once in `s`, so contribution: `(3 - 1) = 2`.
   - 'B' appears once in `s`, so contribution: `(3 - 1) = 2`.
   - 'C' appears once in `s`, so contribution: `(3 - 1) = 2`.
   - 'D' appears once in `s`, so contribution: `(3 - 1) = 2`.

Total `ans`:
- From characters not in `s`: 6
- From characters in `s` with frequency less than `m`: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
- Total `ans`: 6 + 8 = 14

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated based on the above rules.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in s, plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each character i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**
