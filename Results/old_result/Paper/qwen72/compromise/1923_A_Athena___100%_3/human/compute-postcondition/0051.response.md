Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and the first element of `a` is 0.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the first element of `a` is still 0.
