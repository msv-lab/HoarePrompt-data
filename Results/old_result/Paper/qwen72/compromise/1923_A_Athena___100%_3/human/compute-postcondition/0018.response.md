Output State: **`a` is a list where the last element is not 0, or `a` is an empty list if all elements were 0. `res` is 0, `t` is greater than 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed. If `a` originally contained only zeros, it will be an empty list. The variable `res` remains 0, and `t` is still greater than 0.
