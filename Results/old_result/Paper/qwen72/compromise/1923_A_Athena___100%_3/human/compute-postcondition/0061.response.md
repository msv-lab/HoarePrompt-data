The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**
