Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `t` is greater than 0, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `a` is a list with all leading and trailing zeros removed, the only zeros that can remain in the list are those that are neither leading nor trailing.
   - `res` is the count of these zeros within the list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros that are present in the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros.

Given the initial state, the output will be the number of zeros in the list `a` that are not at the beginning or the end of the list.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros)**
