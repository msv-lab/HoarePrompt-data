Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first two elements removed and the new first element is the original second element, `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0**. 

The first element of `a` (which was 0) has been removed, and the list is now non-empty with the original second element as the new first element. The other variables remain unchanged.
