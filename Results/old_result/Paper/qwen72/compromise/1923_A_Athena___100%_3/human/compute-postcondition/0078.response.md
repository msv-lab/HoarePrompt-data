Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, the list `a` will no longer have any trailing zeros. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states, with `i` still being undefined, `t` still being greater than 0 but less than its original value, `n` still being the input integer, and `res` still being 0.
