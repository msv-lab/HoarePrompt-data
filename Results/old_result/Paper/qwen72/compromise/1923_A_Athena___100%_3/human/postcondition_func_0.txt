The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). It then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been processed, and the counts of zeros for each test case have been printed.
