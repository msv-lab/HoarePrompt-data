The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `start` and `end` are integers, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function also interacts with the current directory, which contains subfolders named with digits, and each subfolder may contain `.html` files.

Given the constraints and relationships between `start` and `end`, the function likely processes subfolders with names in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and returns information about `.html` files within these subfolders.

Functionality: **The function processes subfolders in the current directory named with digits ranging from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and returns information about `.html` files within these subfolders. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function does not execute and may return an error or an empty result.**
