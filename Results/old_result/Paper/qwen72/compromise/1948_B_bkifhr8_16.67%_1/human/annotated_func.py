#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive. It returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.
