Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element of the array that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position. However, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program only applies the operation once if it finds an element that is out of order and greater than 10. This is insufficient because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.

2. **Inefficient Check for Sorted Array**: The program checks if the array is sorted after potentially applying the operation once. This check is done using the `func_1` function, which sorts the list and compares it to the original list. This is inefficient and unnecessary if the list is not yet sorted.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**: If the operation is applied in a way that does not resolve the out-of-order issue, the program might enter an infinite loop. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it will not check if further operations are needed to sort the array.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should reset the array and recheck for each test case, but the current implementation might leave the array in an incorrect state for subsequent test cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Apply the operation to all elements that are at least 10 until no more such elements exist.
- Check if the resulting array is sorted after all possible operations have been applied.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for p in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[p] >= 10:
                a = arr[p]
                arr.pop(p)
                arr.insert(p, a // 10)
                arr.insert(p + 1, a % 10)
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version:

- Continuously applies the operation to any element that is at least 10 until no such elements remain.
- Checks if the array is sorted after all operations have been applied.

Given the issues in the original program, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
