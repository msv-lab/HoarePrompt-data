You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    loop = int(input())

            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a set of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, and then reads `n` pairs of integers (a, x). It categorizes these constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints where x == 1, `less` for constraints where x == 2, and `no` for constraints where x == 3. The function then finds the first integer `num` that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, less than the minimum value in `less`, and not present in `no`. If such an integer is found, it prints `num`; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are reset to empty for the next test case, and the variable `loop` is decremented by the number of test cases processed. The initial state of the input variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints. Instead, it only finds the first integer k that satisfies the constraints and prints it, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints, not just the first one.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
The correct output should be `7` because the integers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 satisfy all constraints. However, the given program will output `3` because it stops at the first valid integer it finds and does not count all valid integers.
