Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1`

In this case, the scores `1 1 2` can be achieved with 2 draws. The first and second players could have played two games that both ended in draws, giving them 1 point each, and the third player could have played no games, thus having 2 points from a previous game. However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. 

The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the maximum number of draws. The program calculates `x` as half the total points and `y` as the sum of the points of the two lowest scoring players, and then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This approach does not always correctly account for the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.
