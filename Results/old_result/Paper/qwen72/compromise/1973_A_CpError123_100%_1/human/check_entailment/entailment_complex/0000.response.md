### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total number of points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in case of a win/loss or 2 points in case of a draw).

3. **Even Sum Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, assuming each game contributes 2 points (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
   - The function then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all the points `a` and `b` were from draws.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is intended to ensure that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.

### Flaws in the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**:
  - The program assumes that the maximum number of draws is `a + b`. This is not always correct. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 2`, the program will print `2` (since `min(2, 2) = 2`), but the correct answer should be `1` because only one game could have been a draw (the other game must have been a win/loss to achieve the scores).

- **Correct Calculation**:
  - The correct approach to determine the maximum number of draws is to consider the total number of points and the distribution of points. The maximum number of draws is `(a + b + c) // 2 - (c - b)`, where `(c - b)` represents the number of games that must have been wins/losses to achieve the score difference between the highest and second-highest scores.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
