Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

For the purpose of this task, I will provide the precondition based on the correct function definition.
