### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` checks if both dimensions are odd.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus the output is `NO`. This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Half Dimension Check**:
   - The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles that can only be reassembled into the original rectangle. Therefore, the output is `NO`. This is also correct according to the problem description.

4. **General Case**:
   - The condition `else` covers all other cases where neither of the above conditions is met.
   - In these cases, the program outputs `YES`. This is correct because:
     - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be reassembled into a different rectangle.
     - If both dimensions are even but not equal, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be reassembled into a different rectangle.
     - If both dimensions are even and equal, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, but these can only be reassembled into the original rectangle. However, this case is not explicitly handled by the program.

5. **Specific Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `2 2`, the program outputs `YES` because it does not explicitly handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal.
   - According to the problem description, cutting a 2x2 rectangle into two 1x2 rectangles and then reassembling them into a 2x2 rectangle does not result in a different rectangle, so the correct output should be `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal, leading to an incorrect output for such cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
