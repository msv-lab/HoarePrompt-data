Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle. The conditions used in the program are:

1. `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` - This correctly identifies that if both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.
2. `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` - This condition is incorrect. It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, and if so, it prints 'NO'. However, this is not a valid criterion for determining whether a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original. But a 4x2 rectangle can also be cut into two 4x1 rectangles, which can form a 2x4 rectangle, which is different from the original. The correct condition should be to check if at least one of the dimensions is even, and if so, ensure that the other dimension is not exactly half of the even dimension to avoid the case where the cut results in two identical rectangles that cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

The correct logic should be:
- If both dimensions are odd, print 'NO'.
- If one dimension is even and the other dimension is not exactly half of the even dimension, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b != a // 2) or (b % 2 == 0 and a != b // 2):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.
