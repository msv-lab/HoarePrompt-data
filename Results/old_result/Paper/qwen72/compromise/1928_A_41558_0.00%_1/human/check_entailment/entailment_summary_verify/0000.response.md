### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by combining the two smaller rectangles, and the new rectangle is considered different from the original if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.
   - The program should output "NO" if the original rectangle cannot be transformed into a different rectangle, and "YES" otherwise.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
   - It prints "NO" if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

3. **Original Assessment Evaluation:**
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal (e.g., `2 2`).
   - According to the problem description, if the resulting rectangle is the same as the original, the output should be "NO".
   - The program does indeed output "YES" for the input `2 2`, which is incorrect.

4. **Additional Test Cases:**
   - Let's consider a few more test cases to further validate the program:
     - **Input: `1 2`** (Output: "NO" - Correct, as the only way to cut it is into two 1x1 rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle).
     - **Input: `2 6`** (Output: "YES" - Correct, as it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and then formed into a 4x3 rectangle).
     - **Input: `3 2`** (Output: "YES" - Correct, as it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then formed into a 1x6 rectangle).
     - **Input: `2 2`** (Output: "YES" - Incorrect, as the resulting 1x2 rectangles can only form a 2x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original).
     - **Input: `2 4`** (Output: "YES" - Correct, as it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles and then formed into a 4x2 rectangle).
     - **Input: `6 3`** (Output: "NO" - Correct, as it can only be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal, leading to an incorrect output of "YES" when it should be "NO".
   - This specific case is crucial because it directly affects the correctness of the program's output for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both dimensions are even and equal, leading to an incorrect output for such inputs.
