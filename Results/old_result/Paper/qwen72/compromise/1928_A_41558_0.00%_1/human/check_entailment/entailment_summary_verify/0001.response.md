### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - The second condition checks if either `a` or `b` is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). This condition is intended to check if the rectangle can only be cut into two identical smaller rectangles, which would not form a different rectangle when recombined. However, the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is not equivalent to `a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a`. The current condition can lead to false negatives because it does not correctly handle the case where one dimension is exactly twice the other.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES", indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. This is correct because if the rectangle can be cut into two different smaller rectangles, Bob can always form a different rectangle by rearranging them.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "NO" or "YES" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Corrected Program:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the second condition. The condition should be `a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a` instead of `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`.

Here is the corrected program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the second condition. The corrected program is necessary to ensure the program behaves as expected for all valid inputs.
