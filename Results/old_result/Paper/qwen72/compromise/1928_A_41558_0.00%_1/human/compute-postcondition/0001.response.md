The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted manually. The state of `t` and the parameters `a` and `b` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
