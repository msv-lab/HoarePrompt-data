Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it has printed either 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one of them is exactly half of the other, or 'YES' otherwise. The values of `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `n` is unchanged.**
