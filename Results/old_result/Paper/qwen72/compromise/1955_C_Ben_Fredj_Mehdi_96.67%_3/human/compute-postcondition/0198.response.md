Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `k` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `k` is 1000000000000, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999, or 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `k` is less than the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is at least 2, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`. If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `k` is even, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by `k // 2`, and if `a[g]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0 after any decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, or if `k` is 4294967295 or 5999999999, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` and `k` is not 3000000000 or 5999999999, the conditions regarding `n` and `k` as stated in the precondition are still satisfied. Otherwise, `n` is the first integer in the list `a` minus the number of times `g` was 0 during the loop, `d` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 or a smaller value depending on how many times `a[d]` was 0 during the loop, and `g` is 0 or a larger value depending on how many times `a[g]` was 0 during the loop.**
