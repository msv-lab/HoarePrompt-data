Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is not equal to several specific values (99999999999, 1999999999, 9999999999, 101, 100000000000, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000).
- `n` is 2.
- `k` is 1000000000.
- `a` is `[1000000000, 1000000000]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'0'`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are provided, but they do not affect the `print` statement in any way because the `print` statement is not using these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
