The `print('0')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'0'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.

However, since the print statement is printing a constant string `'0'`, the values of these variables do not affect the output.

Output: **0**
