Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the integer at index `d` in the list `a` is decreased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, `g` is increased by 1 and `d` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `g` and `d` remain unchanged.***
