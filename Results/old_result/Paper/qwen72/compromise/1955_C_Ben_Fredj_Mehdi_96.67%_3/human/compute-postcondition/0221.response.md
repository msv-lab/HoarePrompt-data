The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string `'199999'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `z` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `a`.
- `k` is the second integer in the list `a`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will be the fixed string `'199999'`.

Output: **199999**
