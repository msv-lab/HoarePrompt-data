The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `k // 2`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `k // 2` must still be greater than 1. Since `k` is at least 2, `k // 2` must be at least 1, but for the loop to execute one more time, `k // 2` must be at least 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer in the list `a`, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 2. If no exception occurs, the integers at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` are each decreased by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the decrement, `g` is increased by 1. If `a[d]` was 0 after the decrement, `d` is decreased by 1. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.**
