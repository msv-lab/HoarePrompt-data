You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `z` is `t - 1`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case. If `k` is 1999999998, 1999999999, 99999999999, 10000000000000, 9999999999, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, or if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is less than the sum of all elements in `a` and `k` is not one of the special cases, the first `g` elements and the last `d - g + 1` elements of `a` have been decremented by 1. If `k` is an odd integer, the `g`-th element of `a` has also been decremented by 1. If the `g`-th element of `a` was 1 before the decrement, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1. The loop will terminate either when `i` reaches `k // 2` or when an exception occurs due to `g` or `d` being out of bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `a`, and an integer `k`. For each test case, the function reads `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads `n` integers into the list `a`. It then checks a series of specific conditions involving `k` and the elements of `a`. If any of these conditions are met, it prints a predefined result. If none of the conditions are met, it decrements the first and last non-zero elements of `a` up to `k // 2` times, and if `k` is odd, it decrements the first non-zero element one additional time. Finally, it prints the number of zeros in the list `a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` is 0, `z` is `t - 1`, and `a` is the list of integers from the last test case, potentially modified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a series of hardcoded conditions that check for specific values of `k` and `n`, and then print a fixed number of ships sunk. This approach is not general and will fail for many other inputs. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 5
1 2 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program does not handle this case correctly because it does not follow the logic described in the problem statement for general inputs. Instead, it relies on a series of hardcoded conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
