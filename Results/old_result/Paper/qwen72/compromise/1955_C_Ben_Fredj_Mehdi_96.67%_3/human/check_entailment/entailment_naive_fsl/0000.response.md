Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a series of hardcoded conditions that check for specific values of `k` and `n`, and then print a fixed number of ships sunk. This approach is not general and will fail for many other inputs. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 5
1 2 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program does not handle this case correctly because it does not follow the logic described in the problem statement for general inputs. Instead, it relies on a series of hardcoded conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
