### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - The function iterates over each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its tens and units digits (`y` and `x`).
     - It checks if the tens digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` and increments `n` by 2. Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c` and increments `n` by 1.
     - If the element is the first element and it is greater than 10, it splits the element into its tens and units digits and appends them to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, it appends the original element.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` and increments `n` by 1.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to `c`.
   - If `c` is already sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted.
   - If `c` is not sorted, it appends `0` to the list `b`, indicating that the array cannot be sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting the elements and appending them to `c` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The function should check if the digits can be inserted in such a way that the array remains sorted.
  - The function should also handle cases where the digits need to be inserted in a different order to maintain the sorted property.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be transformed to be sorted. The logic for splitting and appending the digits is not robust enough to ensure that the array can be sorted after the operations.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- For the input `12 28 5`, the program will not correctly determine that the array cannot be sorted. The function will split `12` into `1` and `2`, and `28` into `2` and `8`, but it will not correctly handle the insertion of `8` after `5`.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all cases where the array can be transformed to be sorted. The logic for splitting and appending the digits is flawed and needs to be revised.

Correctness: **False**
