### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It then iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if `y` (the tens digit) is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x` (the units digit), it appends both `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends both `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If `c` is equal to `d`, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the structure and logic of the program.
- It points out that the function `func_1()` should return the result (1 or 0) instead of appending it to `b` directly, and the result should be appended to `b` in the main loop.

### Issues in the Original Program:

- **Result Handling**:
  - The function `func_1()` appends the result directly to `b` instead of returning it.
  - This means that `b` is being modified inside `func_1()`, which is not the best practice and can lead to confusion.
  - The main loop should call `func_1()` and append the returned result to `b`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    b.append(func_1())

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program has a logical structure that is mostly correct but has issues in the way it handles the results.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.

Final: **False** (due to the issues in handling the results, but the logic is correct and can be fixed as shown above).
