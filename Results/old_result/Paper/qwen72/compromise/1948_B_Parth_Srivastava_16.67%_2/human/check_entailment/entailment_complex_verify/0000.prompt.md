You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: `t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single-digit number from `a` or a two-digit number from `a` split into its tens and units digits, with the tens digit appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any).
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`t`, `test_cases`, `k`, and `a` remain the same. `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0. `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0. `n` is the number of elements in `c`. `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single-digit number from `a` or a two-digit number from `a` split into its tens and units digits, with the tens digit appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any). `d` is a sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list with an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` is a list that now includes 0 as its last element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `a` derived from user input. It splits each integer in `a` that is greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, appending them to a new list `c` under specific conditions: the tens digit is appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any). Single-digit numbers from `a` are directly appended to `c`. After processing, it checks if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to include the result of the sorting check for the processed list `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `x` and `y` are set based on the last element of `a` if it is greater than 10.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
NO
YES
```

The program fails on the first test case. The array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` by applying the operation to the elements `12` and `45`, which is a sorted array. However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, specifically in how it handles the splitting of numbers and the comparison with the previous elements in the array. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of splitting multiple elements and ensuring the resulting array is sorted.
