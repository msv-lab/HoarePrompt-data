Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `c` is a list of integers read from a new input.
- The length of the set of `a` is 1, meaning all elements in `a` are the same.
- The length of the set of `c` is 1, meaning all elements in `c` are the same.
- The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(0)
```

The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`. The conditions provided do not affect the value being printed, as the `print` statement is independent of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`.

Output: **0**
