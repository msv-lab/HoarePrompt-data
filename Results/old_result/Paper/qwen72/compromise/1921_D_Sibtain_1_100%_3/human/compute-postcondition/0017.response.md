Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `t2` to be the absolute difference between the second-to-last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `c`. Since `j` is 1, `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j` refer to the last index of the lists `a` and `c` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
