To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `c` is a sorted list of integers read from a new input in descending order.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration.
   - `i` is the number of iterations where `t1` was not greater than `t2`.
   - `j` is the number of iterations where `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
   - `k` is `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - The maximum difference between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` is calculated for each iteration.
   - `ans` is the sum of these maximum differences.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each iteration, the maximum difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` is calculated.
   - Since `a` is sorted in ascending order and `c` is sorted in descending order, the maximum difference will be between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`, the second smallest element of `a` and the second largest element of `c`, and so on.
   - The sum of these maximum differences is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the maximum differences.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in descending order)**
