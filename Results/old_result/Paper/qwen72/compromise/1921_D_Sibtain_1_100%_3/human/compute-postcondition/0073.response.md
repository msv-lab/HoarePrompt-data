Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 if `t2 > t1` and either 2 or 3 otherwise, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `j` is 2 or 3 if `t2 > t1` and 1 or 2 otherwise, `k` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.**
