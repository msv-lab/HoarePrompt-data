The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list `a` of `n` positive integers and a list `c` of `m` positive integers. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements from the sorted lists `a` and `c`. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
