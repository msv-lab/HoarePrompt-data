### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero. This is a valid edge case and is handled correctly.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a key step because it helps in maximizing the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `c`.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the sorted lists `a` and `c`.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates two potential differences:
     - `t1` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the current element in `c` (using the `i` pointer).
     - `t2` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the current element in `c` (using the `len(a) - j` pointer).
   - It then adds the maximum of these two differences to `ans` and increments the appropriate pointer (`i` or `j`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in the loop.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The approach of sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the absolute differences.
  - The use of two pointers to iterate through the lists and choose the maximum difference at each step ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized.
  - The edge case where all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal is correctly handled.

### Potential Issues:
- **Pointer Management:**
  - The program uses `i` and `j` to manage the pointers, but it does not explicitly handle the case where `j` might exceed the length of `a` or `c`. However, since `j` is incremented only when `t2 > t1`, and `i` is incremented otherwise, the program should not encounter this issue given the constraints.

- **Single Element Case:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `a` has only one element by finding the maximum absolute difference between `a[0]` and any element in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by maximizing the total difference `D` for each test case. The logic and edge case handling are sound, and the use of sorting and two pointers is appropriate for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
