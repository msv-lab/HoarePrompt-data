You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, including both those less than or equal to the square root of `x` and those greater than the square root of `x`. The divisors are listed in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers from 1 to k are assigned to the first k positions, followed by the numbers from k-1 to 2 for the next k-2 positions, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - Vasya is given his position `n` and the number `x` he received. We need to determine how many different values of `k` fit this pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given `k`, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the first k positions, the number he receives is `x = n`.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the next k-2 positions, the number he receives is `x = k - (n - k) + 1 = 2k - n + 1`.

3. **Equations:**
   - From the first part of the pattern: \( n = x \)
   - From the second part of the pattern: \( n = 2k - x + 1 \)

4. **Solving for `k`:**
   - For the first equation: \( n = x \) implies \( k \geq x \).
   - For the second equation: \( n = 2k - x + 1 \) implies \( 2k = n + x - 1 \) or \( k = \frac{n + x - 1}{2} \). This `k` must be an integer and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Checking Validity:**
   - We need to check both equations for valid `k` values.
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`, which are then used to check if they fit the pattern.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It is used to find potential `k` values by checking if \( k = \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \) and \( k = \frac{n - x}{2} \) are valid.

7. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find divisors and checks if they fit the pattern.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in a list `output` and removes duplicates.

8. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find divisors.
   - The logic for checking if `k` fits the pattern is correct, but it could be more efficient.
   - The program does not handle the case where `k = 1` (which is not allowed) explicitly, but the pattern ensures that `k > 1`.

9. **Efficiency:**
   - The program could be optimized by directly calculating the potential `k` values without finding all divisors, but the current approach is correct and works within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and follows the problem constraints. It correctly identifies the valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
