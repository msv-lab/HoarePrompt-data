### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where students are numbered in a specific sequence based on a value `k`. The sequence repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - Vasya remembers his position `n` and the number `x` he received. We need to determine how many possible values of `k` fit this pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of length `k`.
   - For a given `n` and `x`, the number `x` can appear in two possible positions within the repeating cycle:
     - In the increasing part: `x` can be in positions `x, x + (2k-2), x + 2(2k-2), ...`
     - In the decreasing part: `x` can be in positions `2k-1-x, 2k-1-x + (2k-2), 2k-1-x + 2(2k-2), ...`

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If `x` is in the increasing part, then `n` can be expressed as `n = x + m * (2k-2)` for some integer `m`.
   - If `x` is in the decreasing part, then `n` can be expressed as `n = (2k-1-x) + m * (2k-2)` for some integer `m`.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
     - These conditions are derived from the above formulations and ensure that `n` can be expressed in the form `x + m * (2k-2)` or `(2k-1-x) + m * (2k-2)` respectively.
   - The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x` in a specific order.
   - The program then checks if the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` can form valid `k` values by ensuring that `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

5. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - This function correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a combined list.
   - The divisors are found by iterating up to the square root of `x` and checking for divisibility.
   - The function ensures that all divisors are included and returns them in the correct order.

6. **Combining the Results:**
   - The program combines the results from both conditions and ensures that each `k` is unique by converting the list to a set.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the possible values of `k` based on the given constraints.
- The logic for checking the conditions and finding the divisors is sound.
- The function `func_1(x)` is implemented correctly and efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
