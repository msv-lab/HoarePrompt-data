Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue that causes it to produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number, but it does not correctly handle the case where the number is a perfect square. This can lead to duplicate divisors being added to the list, which can affect the final output.

Additionally, the main logic of the program does not correctly handle the constraints and the pattern of the settling described in the problem. The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, but it does not fully account for the repeating pattern of the settling every `2k - 2` positions.

For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The correct output should be `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable).
- However, the program might not correctly identify all these values due to the issues mentioned.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
1. Correctly handle the divisors of the numbers.
2. Properly account for the repeating pattern of the settling every `2k - 2` positions.
3. Ensure that the conditions for valid `k` are correctly applied.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly handles these issues:

```python
def count_k(n, x):
    def divisors(num):
        divs = []
        for i in range(1, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                divs.append(i)
                if i != num // i:
                    divs.append(num // i)
        return divs

    valid_ks = set()
    for d in divisors(n + x - 2):
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    for d in divisors(n - x):
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_k(n, x))
```

This corrected version ensures that all divisors are correctly identified and that the conditions for valid `k` are properly applied.
