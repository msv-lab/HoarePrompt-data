You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, including both those less than or equal to the square root of `x` and those greater than the square root of `x`. The divisors are listed in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue that causes it to produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number, but it does not correctly handle the case where the number is a perfect square. This can lead to duplicate divisors being added to the list, which can affect the final output.

Additionally, the main logic of the program does not correctly handle the constraints and the pattern of the settling described in the problem. The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, but it does not fully account for the repeating pattern of the settling every `2k - 2` positions.

For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The correct output should be `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable).
- However, the program might not correctly identify all these values due to the issues mentioned.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
1. Correctly handle the divisors of the numbers.
2. Properly account for the repeating pattern of the settling every `2k - 2` positions.
3. Ensure that the conditions for valid `k` are correctly applied.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly handles these issues:

```python
def count_k(n, x):
    def divisors(num):
        divs = []
        for i in range(1, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                divs.append(i)
                if i != num // i:
                    divs.append(num // i)
        return divs

    valid_ks = set()
    for d in divisors(n + x - 2):
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    for d in divisors(n - x):
        k = (d + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_k(n, x))
```

This corrected version ensures that all divisors are correctly identified and that the conditions for valid `k` are properly applied.
