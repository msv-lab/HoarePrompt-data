### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers from 1 to k are assigned to the first k positions, followed by the numbers from k-1 to 2 for the next k-2 positions, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - Vasya is given his position `n` and the number `x` he received. We need to determine how many different values of `k` fit this pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given `k`, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the first k positions, the number he receives is `x = n`.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the next k-2 positions, the number he receives is `x = k - (n - k) + 1 = 2k - n + 1`.

3. **Equations:**
   - From the first part of the pattern: \( n = x \)
   - From the second part of the pattern: \( n = 2k - x + 1 \) which simplifies to \( 2k = n + x - 1 \) or \( k = \frac{n + x - 1}{2} \).

4. **Solving for `k`:**
   - For the first equation: \( n = x \) implies \( k \geq x \).
   - For the second equation: \( k = \frac{n + x - 1}{2} \) must be an integer and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Checking Validity:**
   - The program checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find divisors of these values.
   - It then checks if the divisors fit the pattern by ensuring \( k \geq x \) and \( k \) is an integer.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - This function correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - The divisors are found by iterating up to the square root of `x` and checking divisibility, which is an efficient approach.

7. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find divisors and checks if they fit the pattern.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in a list `output` and removes duplicates.

8. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find divisors.
   - The logic for checking if `k` fits the pattern is correct, but it could be more efficient.
   - The program does not handle the case where `k = 1` (which is not allowed) explicitly, but the pattern ensures that `k > 1`.
   - The program should ensure that the calculated `k` values are greater than 1 and are integers.

9. **Efficiency:**
   - The program could be optimized by directly calculating the potential `k` values without finding all divisors, but the current approach is correct and works within the given constraints.
   - The use of `func_1` to find divisors is a valid approach, but it might not be the most efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and follows the problem constraints. It correctly identifies the valid `k` values for each test case. However, the program could be optimized for better performance, especially for large inputs. Despite this, the current implementation is sufficient to solve the problem within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
