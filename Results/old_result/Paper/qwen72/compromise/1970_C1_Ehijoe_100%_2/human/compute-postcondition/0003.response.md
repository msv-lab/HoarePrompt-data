Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a new list for any key that does not already exist in the dictionary. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged.
