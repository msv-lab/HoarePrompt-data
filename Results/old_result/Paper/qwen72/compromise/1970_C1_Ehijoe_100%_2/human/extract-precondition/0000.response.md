Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of nodes `n`, the edges of the tree, and the initial node for the stone. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def game_winner(n, edges, initial_node):
```

**Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and initial_node is an integer such that 1 ≤ initial_node ≤ n.**
