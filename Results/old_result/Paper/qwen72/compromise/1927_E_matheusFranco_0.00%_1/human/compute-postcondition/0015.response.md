To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given the current state, this translates to `2 * k < n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`, and `len(permutation)` is `n`, the loop will execute again if `2 * k < n`.
   - No other adjustments are needed because the other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `i`) do not directly affect the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute again if `2 * k < n`. Therefore, no changes are needed to the state as long as this condition holds true.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[0]` which is 1 and `permutation[k]` which is 2, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k` and `2 * k < n`**
