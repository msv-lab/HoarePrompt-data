Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]` is the last value assigned, and `curr_v` is the final value after all assignments.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`multiples_of_k_plus_i`**: After the loop completes, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to the length of the `permutation` list because the loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` until it reaches or exceeds the length of the list.
- **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]`**: The last element in the `permutation` list that was updated by the loop will be `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]`, which will hold the last value assigned by the loop.
- **`curr_v`**: The value of `curr_v` will be the final value after all the assignments in the loop. This value will be the initial `curr_v` plus the number of times the loop executed, which is the number of multiples of `k` in the `permutation` list.
