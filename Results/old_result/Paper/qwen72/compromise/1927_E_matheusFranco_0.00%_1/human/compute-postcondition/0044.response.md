Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `2 < n` is true, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]` is now `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.
- The condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)` remains valid, indicating that the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` plus `k` is still less than the length of the permutation.
- The value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k]` is updated to `curr_v + 1`, reflecting the previous value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` before it was incremented.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
