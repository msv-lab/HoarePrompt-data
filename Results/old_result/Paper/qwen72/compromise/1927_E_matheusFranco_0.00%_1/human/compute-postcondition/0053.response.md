The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function internally uses or generates two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value from the provided information. 

Given the constraints, a plausible functionality could involve operations or computations that depend on the relationship between `n` and `k`, but without further details on the output, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function internally uses two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
