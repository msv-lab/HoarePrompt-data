Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 2`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `permutation[1]` is `n // k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1, changing from `n // k + 1` to `n // k + 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
