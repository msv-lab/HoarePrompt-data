Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[0]` which is 1, `permutation[k]` which is 2, and `permutation[2 * k]` which is 3, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k` and `2 * k < n`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `curr_v` (which is 3) to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `2 * k`) in the `permutation` list. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
