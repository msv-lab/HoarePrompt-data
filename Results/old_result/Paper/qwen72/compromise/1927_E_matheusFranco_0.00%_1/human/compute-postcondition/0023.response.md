The code snippet `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v` updates the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the list `permutation` to the value of `curr_v`. Let's break down the impact:

- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, so `permutation[1]` is updated to `curr_v`.
- `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`.

Therefore, the value at index 1 in the `permutation` list is now `n // k + 1`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `i`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `permutation[1]` is `n // k + 1`.**
