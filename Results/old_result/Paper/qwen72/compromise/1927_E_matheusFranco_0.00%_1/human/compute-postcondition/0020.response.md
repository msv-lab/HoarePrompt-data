The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i]` is set to `i // k + 1` for every multiple of `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`), and remains 0 otherwise, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n // k + 1`, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`.**
