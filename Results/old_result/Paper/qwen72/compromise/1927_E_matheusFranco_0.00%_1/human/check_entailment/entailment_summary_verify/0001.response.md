Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the permutation:
     - The outer loop iterates over the range of `k`.
     - The inner loop fills the permutation at indices that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - The value `curr_v` is incremented and placed at these positions.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It runs a loop `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm ensures that the permutation is filled in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The key idea is to distribute the numbers in a pattern that maintains the required property. By placing numbers at positions that are multiples of `k`, the algorithm ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
   - However, the specific implementation in `func_1` needs to be verified to ensure it meets the k-level permutation criteria.

5. **Verification of the Algorithm**:
   - Let's consider the logic in `func_1`:
     - The loop `for i in range(k):` ensures that each starting position `i` within the first `k` elements is considered.
     - The inner loop `while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):` fills the permutation at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
     - This ensures that the numbers are distributed in a balanced manner across the permutation.
   - To verify if the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, we need to check the constructed permutation:
     - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation might look like `[1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 10]`.
     - The sums of the segments would be:
       - `1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17`
       - `6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18`
       - `3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17`
       - `7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18`
       - `2 + 5 + 4 + 8 = 19`
       - `5 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 26`
       - `4 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 31`
     - The sums are not balanced, indicating a potential issue with the algorithm.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment assumed that the algorithm correctly constructs a k-level permutation, but the verification step shows that the sums of the segments do not necessarily differ by no more than 1.
   - Therefore, the algorithm as implemented in `func_1` does not always produce a valid k-level permutation.

Final: **False**
