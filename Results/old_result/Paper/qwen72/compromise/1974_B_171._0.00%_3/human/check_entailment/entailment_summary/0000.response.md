Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the decoding should reverse the encoding process, where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which is the sorted unique characters of the original string `s`). However, the function `func_1` in the program creates a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', which does not follow the symmetric replacement rule. This means the program will not produce the correct original string when decoding.

For example, for the encoded string "serofedsoc", the correct decoding should be "codeforces" as per the problem description. However, the program will produce a different output because it does not use the symmetric replacement rule but instead maps each character to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order they appear.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
