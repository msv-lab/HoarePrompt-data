### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` that contains all distinct letters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on).

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` and then map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the character mappings.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - For each character in the encoded string `encoded`, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
     - If it is, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
     - If it is not, it iterates through the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a character that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
     - It then adds this character to the `mapping` dictionary with the current encoded character as its value.
     - Finally, it appends the found character to the `decoded` list.
   - The function returns the decoded string by joining the characters in the `decoded` list.

5. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - The program assumes that the characters in the encoded string `b` will directly map back to the characters in the original string `s` in a one-to-one manner, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should involve constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order and then mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem. It fails to construct the auxiliary string `r` and does not perform the symmetric mapping correctly. Therefore, the output will not be the original string `s` for most test cases.
