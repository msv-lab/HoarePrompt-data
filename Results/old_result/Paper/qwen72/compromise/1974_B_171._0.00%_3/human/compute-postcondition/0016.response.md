Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 99, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'c' mapped to `char` if 'b' is not present in the values of `mapping`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by adding a key-value pair where the key is `chr(99)` (which is 'c') and the value is `char`.
- If 'b' is not present in the values of `mapping`, then the key 'c' is mapped to `char`.
- If 'b' is already present in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` remains an empty dictionary.
- The values of `encoded`, `char`, `c`, and `decoded` remain unchanged.
