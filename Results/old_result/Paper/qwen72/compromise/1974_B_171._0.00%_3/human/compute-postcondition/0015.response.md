The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the range defined by `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 to 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'. The range remains the same.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 99, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char` if `chr(98)` ('b') is not present in the values of `mapping`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list.**
