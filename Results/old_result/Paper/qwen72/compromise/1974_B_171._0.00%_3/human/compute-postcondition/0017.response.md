Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 99, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'c' mapped to `char` if 'b' is not present in the values of `mapping`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
