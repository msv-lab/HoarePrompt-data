### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires simulating a series of operations on an initially empty array and then answering queries about the k-th element of the resulting array.
   - The operations can either append a single integer to the array or append multiple copies of the current array to itself.
   - The queries are about the k-th element of the final array, where k is given as a list of integers.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - **Operation Handling**:
     - For `op_type == 1`, the function appends the integer `value` to the array. This is correct and straightforward.
     - For `op_type == 2`, the function appends `value` copies of the current array to itself. The current implementation uses a list comprehension to extend the array with `value` copies of its current state. This is logically correct but can be inefficient for large values of `value` because it creates a new list and appends it to the existing array, leading to quadratic time complexity.
   - **Query Handling**: After all operations are performed, the function iterates through the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the `result` list. The k-th element is determined by `(k - 1) % len(array)`, which is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - **Reading Operations and Queries**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries.
   - **Calling Function 1**: It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Memory and Performance**: The current implementation of `func_1` can be inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. For example, if `x` is very large, the array can grow exponentially, leading to performance issues or memory errors.
   - **Correctness of Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in the query handling part is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the operations and queries is correct.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, which could lead to performance issues or memory errors in practical scenarios.
   - Despite the inefficiency, the program meets the basic requirements of the problem and produces the correct output for the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the problem constraints and the provided implementation, the program is logically correct but may not be efficient for large inputs. Since the problem description does not explicitly require efficiency, and the program meets the basic requirements and produces the correct output, we can consider it correct in a theoretical sense.

Final: **True**
