You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value) such that op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is a positive integer. If op_type is 1, then 1 <= value <= n. If op_type is 2, then 1 <= value <= 10^9. queries is a list of positive integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after all n operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `array` contains the elements appended and extended based on the operations list, and `result` remains an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `array` remains unchanged, and `result` contains the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.
    return result
    #The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple represents an operation type and a value, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements from the array at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, where `array` is modified based on the operations provided.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
