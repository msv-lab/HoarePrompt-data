### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and constructs a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a` using the slice notation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - This means that the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed, while the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) remain in their original order.

3. **Output:**
   - The modified list `a` is printed, which is the permutation.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are in descending order, and the elements at odd indices are in ascending order.
   - This construction helps in breaking the divisibility pattern because:
     - For any two even indices `i` and `j`, `p_i` and `p_j` are in descending order, making it less likely for `p_i` to divide `p_j`.
     - For any two odd indices `i` and `j`, `p_i` and `p_j` are in ascending order, making it less likely for `p_{i+1}` to divide `p_{j+1}`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 3 correctly, as all permutations of length 3 are valid.
   - For larger `n`, the permutation construction method ensures that the divisibility condition is not met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
