Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function.

2. **Permutation Generation**: Inside `func_1`, the program generates a list `a` of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), which is a valid permutation of length `n`.

3. **Reversing Even Indices**: The line `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`. This ensures that the permutation is modified in a way that avoids the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the modified permutation using `print(*a)`.

### Explanation of the Reversal:
- For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Reversing the elements at even indices (0-based) gives `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
- This permutation is valid because:
  - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
  - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.

- For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Reversing the elements at even indices (0-based) gives `[3, 2, 1]`.
- This permutation is valid because:
  - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.

### General Case:
- For any `n`, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- Reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the permutation is modified in a way that avoids the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

Thus, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case.
