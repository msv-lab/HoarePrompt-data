Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times the integer appears in the list `a` (but only for integers that appear an odd number of times).
