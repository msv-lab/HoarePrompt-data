Output State: **`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, and now `rev_res` also includes the reversed string of the second element of `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 1, `val_in` is the second element of `rev_val`.**
