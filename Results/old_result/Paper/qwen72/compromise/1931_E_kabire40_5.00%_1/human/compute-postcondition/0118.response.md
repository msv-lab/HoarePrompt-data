Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least three strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the third string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the third string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the reversed string of `x` is appended to `rev_val`.**

To break it down:
- `y` remains 2.
- `operational_list` remains a list of strings from the input that must have at least three strings.
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain assigned the values from the input split by a space.
- `x` remains the third string in the `operational_list`.
- `x_rev` is now the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
- `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x`.
- The condition for `rev_res` remains the same: if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the third string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the reversed string of `x` is appended to `rev_val`.
