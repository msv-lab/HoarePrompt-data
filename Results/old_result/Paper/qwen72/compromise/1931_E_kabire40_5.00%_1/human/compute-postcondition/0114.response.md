Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least two strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation:
- `rev_res` was initially an empty string and is now updated to include the second string in `operational_list` (which is `x`).
- All other variables (`y`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, `x_rev`, and `rev_val`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
