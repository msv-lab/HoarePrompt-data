Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 1 element, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string followed by the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the reversed string of the second element of `rev_val`.***
