The value of `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` to it. The value of `val_in` is the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`. Since `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` that meet specific criteria, and `val_in` is the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`, `rev_res` will now contain this string representation.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`.**
