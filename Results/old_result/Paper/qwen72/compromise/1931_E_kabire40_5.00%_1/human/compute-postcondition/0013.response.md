Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the second element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list` and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, which is the second element in `operational_list`.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `rev_res` and `rev_val` remains the same as in the initial state, depending on the length of the string representation of `x_rev` compared to the length of `x`.
