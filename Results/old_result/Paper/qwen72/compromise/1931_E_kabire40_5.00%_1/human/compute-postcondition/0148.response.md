Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `y` is 2.
2. `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input.
3. `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space.
4. `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`.
5. `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, plus the string representations of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed values of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`.
6. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Anna')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Anna'`.
- The initial state describes various variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement, which is the string `'Anna'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Anna**
