Output State: **`y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is -1, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space.** 

The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` updates the `operational_list` to be a list of strings based on the input provided. The input is split by spaces, and the resulting substrings are stored in `operational_list`. The variables `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, but their types (string) remain unchanged. All other variables (`y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `x`) are not affected by this code snippet.
