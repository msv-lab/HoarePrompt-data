Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the string representations of the integer values of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, and `x` is -1.**

Explanation:
- `rev_val` is now an empty list, as it has been reassigned to `[]`.
- `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1, which is now `-1` because `rev_val` is empty.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
