Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the value of the reversed string of `x` converted to an integer.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
