Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, and `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is followed by the string representation of the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`, and `val_in` is the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is followed by the reversed string of `val_in`, and `val_in` is the first element of `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 1 element. `x` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is followed by the string representation of the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, and `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not even, `rev_res` is followed by the reversed string of the second element of `rev_val`, and `val_in` is the second element of `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements. `x` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, and then followed by either the string representation of `val_in` (if `x` is even) or the reversed string representation of `val_in` (if `x` is not even). `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 3 elements. `x` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
