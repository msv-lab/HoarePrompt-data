Output State: **`y` is 1, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 2 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
- The values of `y`, `x`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain the same as in the initial state.
