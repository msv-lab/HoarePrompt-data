Output State: **`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least two strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
- Since the code snippet does not check the length of `x_rev` or update `rev_res` and `rev_val`, these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
- The initial state specifies that if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged.
- The values of `y`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, and `max_power` are not affected by the code snippet.
