### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to any color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice paints the ribbon in the most optimal way (i.e., distributing the colors as evenly as possible), Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - Alice can win if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

4. **Explanation of the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `if n <= k`: If the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob can always make all parts the same color. Hence, Alice cannot win, and the program prints 'NO'.
     - `if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most common color is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can still repaint those parts to the most common color, making all parts the same color. Hence, Alice cannot win, and the program prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can win, and the program prints 'Yes'.

5. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that will have the most common color when Alice paints the ribbon optimally.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that are not the most common color.
   - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint those parts to the most common color, making all parts the same color.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `n == 1`, Bob can always make all parts the same color.
     - When `m == 1`, all parts will be the same color initially, and Bob can always make them the same color.

### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 1000\).
  - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le m, k \le n \le 50\).

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case.
  - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read and stored as integers.

- **Condition Check:**
  - **First Condition: `if n <= k`**
    - If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, Bob can always make all parts the same color. This condition is correct.
  - **Second Condition: `if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
    - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most common color is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can still repaint those parts to the most common color, making all parts the same color. This condition is also correct.

- **Output:**
  - If either of the conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
  - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes'.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all necessary cases, including edge cases.

Final: **True**
