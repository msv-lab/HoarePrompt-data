### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon to any color he chooses, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that will have the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The condition `n <= k` is correct because if Bob can repaint all parts, he will always win.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is also correct. If the number of parts that are not the most frequent color is less than `k`, Bob can repaint those parts to match the most frequent color, making all parts the same color.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if `n = 1`, Bob can always repaint the single part to any color, so the output is 'NO'.
   - If `m = 1`, Alice can only use one color, so Bob can always make all parts the same color, and the output is 'NO'.
   - If `k = 1` and `m > 1`, Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by using at least two different colors, so the output is 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
