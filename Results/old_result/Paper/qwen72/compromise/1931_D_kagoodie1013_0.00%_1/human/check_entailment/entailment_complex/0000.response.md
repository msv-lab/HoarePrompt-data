Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs. However, there are some issues in the logic of the function that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mod_x` and `mod_y`**:
   - The program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`. This is incorrect because:
     - For `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, `a_i % x + a_j % x` should be `0` modulo `x`.
     - For `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `a_i % y - a_j % y` should be `0` modulo `y`.
   - Instead, the program should calculate `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting**:
   - The program increments `count` by `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`. This is incorrect because:
     - It counts pairs where either `a_i % x == -a_j % x` or `a_i % y == a_j % y`, but it should count pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.
   - The correct approach would be to use a nested loop to check each pair `(i, j)` and increment `count` only if both conditions are met.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The current approach is inefficient for large arrays because it uses a nested loop, which would result in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). This is not optimal given the constraints \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
