Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`.

The function `func_1` attempts to count pairs `(i, j)` such that:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

However, the implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. Specifically, the program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to count the number of pairs based on the conditions:
- `mod_x = -num % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`

The program then increments the count by the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current `mod_x` and `mod_y` keys. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n`.
2. Check if both conditions are satisfied for each pair.
3. Count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

The current implementation does not ensure that both conditions are met for the same pair `(i, j)`. Instead, it counts pairs that satisfy either condition, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
