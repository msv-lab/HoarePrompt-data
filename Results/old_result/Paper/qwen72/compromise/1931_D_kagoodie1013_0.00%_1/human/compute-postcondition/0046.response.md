Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` plus the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and the value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and the value 1, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
- `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` checks if `mod_x` is a key in `mod_x_map`. If it is, it returns the value associated with that key; otherwise, it returns 0. Since `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, it is checked against the dictionary.
- Similarly, `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` checks if `mod_y` is a key in `mod_y_map`. If it is, it returns the value associated with that key; otherwise, it returns 0. Since `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, it is checked against the dictionary.
- The original value of `count` was 0, so the new value of `count` is the sum of the values returned by the two dictionary lookups.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
