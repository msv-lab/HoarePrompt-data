The only objects in the loop head are the `test_cases` list and the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more tuple in the `test_cases` list to process. At the end of the last iteration, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` was the second tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, and the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` will be the third tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, the `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`**.
