Output State: **`test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code and the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value 1, `mod_y_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` updates the value of `count`.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, and `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` retrieves the value associated with `mod_x` from `mod_x_map`, or 0 if `mod_x` is not a key in `mod_x_map`.
- `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` retrieves the value associated with `mod_y` from `mod_y_map`, or 0 if `mod_y` is not a key in `mod_y_map`.
- Since `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` and `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`, and both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` contain these keys with the value 1, `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` both return 1.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by 2.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
