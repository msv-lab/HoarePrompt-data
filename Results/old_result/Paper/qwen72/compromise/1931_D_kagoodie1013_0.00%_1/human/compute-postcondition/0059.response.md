Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the second tuple in `test_cases`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The `results` list contains one element, which is the final value of `count`. The `count` variable is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`. The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys that are the remainders of each `num` in `arr` when divided by `x`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appears. The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys that are the remainders of each `num` in `arr` when divided by `y`, and the values are the counts of how many times each remainder appears. The `num` variable is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x`, and `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y`.**
