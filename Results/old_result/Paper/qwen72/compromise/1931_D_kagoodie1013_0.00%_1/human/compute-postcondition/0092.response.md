Output State: **The program returns the `results` list, which contains as many elements as there are tuples in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple, where `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the respective `arr`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries for each tuple contain keys representing the unique remainders of `num % x` and `num % y` for each `num` in the respective `arr`, with values representing the count of times each remainder appears.**
