The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `arr` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, and `num` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
