Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string and its current value is `<`, `arr` is `[1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**

The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates the `arr` list to contain the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
