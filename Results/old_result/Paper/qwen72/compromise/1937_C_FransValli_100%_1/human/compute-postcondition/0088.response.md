Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or it remains 0 if no such index exists, `arr` is `[0]`, `res` is an input string.**

The initial state is updated by the assignment of `res` to the input string provided by the user. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
