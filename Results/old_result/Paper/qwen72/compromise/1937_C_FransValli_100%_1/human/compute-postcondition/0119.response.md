Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input string.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - `mini` is 0.
   - If `res` is `'>',` `mini` is set to `item`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print a string starting with a question mark (`?`), followed by the values of `mini`, `mini`, `item`, `item`, and will flush the output buffer.
   - We need to determine the values of `mini` and `item`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is initially set to 0.
   - The value of `mini` will only change if `res` is `'>'.` However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `res`, so we cannot definitively say whether `mini` will be 0 or `item`.
   - `item` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It is used in the condition to set `mini`, but its value is not provided.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is `'>',` then `mini` will be set to `item`.
   - If `res` is not `'>',` then `mini` will remain 0.

6. **Output:**
   - If `res` is `'>',` the output will be `? item item item item`.
   - If `res` is not `'>',` the output will be `? 0 0 item item`.

Since the exact value of `res` and `item` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is 0 if `res` is not '>', otherwise it is the value of `item`, and [item] is the value of `item`)**
