The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists, and `maxi` is set to 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**
