The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**
