Postcondition: ***`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is updated to [1]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is updated to [0, 1] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` remains [0] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.***
