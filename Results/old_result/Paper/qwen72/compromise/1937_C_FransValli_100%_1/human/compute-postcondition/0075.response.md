Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` is the input provided by the user.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1. If `res` is not '<', `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it remains undefined or some default value (which is not specified, so we will assume it is not set).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, and the print statement will output `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not defined, and the print statement will output `? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2`, where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi` (which is not specified in the initial state).

Since the initial state specifies that `res` is the input provided by the user and if `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1, we can only determine the output if `res` is '<'. If `res` is not '<', the value of `maxi` is not defined, and we cannot provide a precise output.

Given the precondition, the most precise output we can determine is:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if res is '<')**
