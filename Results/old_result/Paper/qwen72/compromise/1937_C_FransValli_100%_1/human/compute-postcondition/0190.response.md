Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<` and must have at least 4 elements, `mini` is the third element in `arr` if `res` is `'>`, otherwise `mini` is `arr[0]`, and `item` is the fourth element in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `res` is now the new input string provided by the user.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
