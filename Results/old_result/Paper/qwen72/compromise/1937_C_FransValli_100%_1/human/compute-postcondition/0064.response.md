Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0: This means the user has input a positive integer, which is stored in the variable `n`.
   - `_` is 0: This variable is initialized to 0 and is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0: This confirms that `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`: This means `i` is initialized to one less than the input integer `n`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '='.
   - `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or it remains the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string starting with `!`, followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` will be 0.
   - `mini` is the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>'. If no such element exists, `mini` will be the first element of `arr`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be a string in the format `! [maxi] [mini]`.
   - `maxi` will be the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `mini` will be the last element in the list `arr` for which the input `res` was not '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be:
Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest integer i for which the input res was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and mini is the last element in the list arr for which the input res was not '>', or the first element of arr if no such element exists)**
