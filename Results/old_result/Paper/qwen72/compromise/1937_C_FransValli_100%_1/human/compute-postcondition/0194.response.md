Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`n` remains the same**: This means `n` is a constant value that does not change throughout the program.

2. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is set to the value of `n` minus 1. For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` will be 4.

3. **`maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses**: This means `maxi` is the index of the last input response that was `<`. If there are no `<` responses, `maxi` will be undefined or some default value, but the precondition does not specify this default value.

4. **`res` is the last input string**: This means `res` holds the most recent input string received.

5. **`mini` is the last element in `arr` that received a `>` response, or the first element in `arr` if no `>` responses were received**: This means `mini` is the index of the last element in `arr` that received a `>` response. If no `>` responses were received, `mini` will be the first element in `arr`.

6. **`arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`**: This means `arr` is a list of indices where the input was `=` or the last index where the input was `<`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)` will output the following:

- The exclamation mark `!` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that received a `>` response, or the first element in `arr` if no `>` responses were received.

Since the exact input responses and the list `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the values of `maxi` and `mini` based on the given conditions.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, and mini is the last element in arr that received a `>` response, or the first element in arr if no `>` responses were received)**
