Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]` if `res` is not `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `res` is `=`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to the new input string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `arr` depends on the new value of `res`. If `res` is `<`, `arr` becomes `[1]`. If `res` is not `=`, `arr` becomes `[0]`. If `res` is `=`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`.
