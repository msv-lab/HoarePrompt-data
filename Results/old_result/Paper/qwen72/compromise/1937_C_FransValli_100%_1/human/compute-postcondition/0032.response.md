Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input string.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [1].
   - If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1] and `res` remains '='.
   - Otherwise, `arr` remains [0] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', `arr` is [1], so `arr[0]` is 1.
     - If `res` is '=', `arr` is [0, 1], so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - Otherwise, `arr` is [0], so `arr[0]` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will always output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
   - Since `maxi` is 0 and `i` is 2, the output will be:
     - If `res` is '<': `'?' 0 1 0 2`
     - If `res` is '=': `'?' 0 0 0 2`
     - Otherwise: `'?' 0 0 0 2`

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will depend on the value of `res`. However, since `res` is not explicitly provided, we need to consider all possible cases.
   - If `res` is '<', the output will be: `'?' 0 1 0 2`
   - If `res` is '=', the output will be: `'?' 0 0 0 2`
   - Otherwise, the output will be: `'?' 0 0 0 2`

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't determine a single output. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Output: **'?' 0 1 0 2 (if res is '<') or '?' 0 0 0 2 (if res is '=' or not '<')**
