Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first and second arguments in the print statement are `maxi`.
   - The third and fourth arguments in the print statement are `i`.

4. **Evaluate `maxi`:**
   - `maxi` is determined by the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.

5. **Evaluate `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

6. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and then the value of `i` twice.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the value of `res`:

- If `res` is '<':
  - `maxi` will be 1.
  - The output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.

- If `res` is not '<':
  - `maxi` will be 0.
  - The output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the value of `res` is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given initial state. Therefore, we need to provide a precise description of the output based on the possible values of `res`.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 1 if res is '<', otherwise [maxi] is 0)**
