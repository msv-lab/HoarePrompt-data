Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [i]` reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list containing the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `arr` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.
