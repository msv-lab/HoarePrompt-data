Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `res` is the new input string '<', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.** 

The value of `maxi` is updated to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the string '<', `arr` is a list from 0 to `n-1`, and `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
