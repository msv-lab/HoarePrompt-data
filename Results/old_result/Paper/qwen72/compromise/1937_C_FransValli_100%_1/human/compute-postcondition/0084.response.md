Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or it remains 0 if no such index exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set. It is the input integer greater than 1.
- **`i`**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`maxi`**: The value of `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations. If no such index exists (i.e., `res` was never '<' for any `i`), `maxi` will remain `0`.
