Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`.**

The value of `res` is updated to the input string provided. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and the conditions for `arr` remain unchanged.
