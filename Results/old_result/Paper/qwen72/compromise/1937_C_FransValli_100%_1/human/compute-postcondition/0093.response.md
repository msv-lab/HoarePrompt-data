Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `res` is an input string, `res` is not '<', and the current value of `res` is '='.**

The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. The initial value of `arr` was `[0]`, so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged.
