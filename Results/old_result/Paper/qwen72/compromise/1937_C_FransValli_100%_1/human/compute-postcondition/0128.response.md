Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` is greater than 1**: This condition remains unchanged because it was part of the initial state.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: This also remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not modified within the loop.
- **`maxi` is 0**: This remains unchanged because `maxi` is not modified within the loop.
- **`res` is the last input string**: The value of `res` is updated with each iteration based on the input provided, so after the loop completes, `res` will hold the last input string.
- **`arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`**: This remains unchanged because the array `arr` is not modified within the loop.
- **`mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists**: The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, and for each `item` in the array, it checks the input. If the input is '>', `mini` is updated to the current `item`. Therefore, after all iterations, `mini` will be the smallest index in the array for which the input was '>', or it will remain 0 if no such index exists.
