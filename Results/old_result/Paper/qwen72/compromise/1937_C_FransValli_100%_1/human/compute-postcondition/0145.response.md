Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is either 2 (if `res` is '<') or 0 (if `res` is not '<').
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` will be 2, so the output will be `'?' 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` will be 0, so the output will be `'?' 0 0 3 3`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases.
   - The output will be either `'?' 2 2 3 3` or `'?' 0 0 3 3`.

Output: **'?' 2 2 3 3 (if res is '<') or '?' 0 0 3 3 (if res is not '<')**
