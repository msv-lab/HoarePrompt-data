Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where it can make queries to find the maximum XOR of any two indices in a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The input n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the function can make at most 3n queries. The permutation p is fixed and not adaptive, and the function must output the indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize p_i ⊕ p_j.**
