Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of adjacent pairs in `s` where the characters are different minus 1, and `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `count` and `flag` retain their original values.***
