Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, `count` is 2, `j` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', then `flag` is True and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains 0.***
