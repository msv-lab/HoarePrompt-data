Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces to cut the binary string into so that these pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The program incorrectly increments the `count` every time there is a transition between different characters ('0' to '1' or '1' to '0'), which does not align with the requirement of finding the minimum number of cuts.

The correct approach should focus on identifying the point where the first '1' appears after a '0'. Once this transition is found, the rest of the string can be considered as a single piece because any sequence of '1's following '0's can be moved together to form a sorted string. If no such transition exists (i.e., the string is already sorted), only one piece is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Find the first occurrence of '1' after a '0'
        first_one_after_zero = False
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == '0' and s[i + 1] == '1':
                first_one_after_zero = True
                break
        
        # If there is a '1' after a '0', we need 2 pieces; otherwise, 1 piece
        count = 2 if first_one_after_zero else 1
        print(count)
```

This version correctly identifies whether the string needs to be split into two pieces (if there is a '1' after a '0') or remains as one piece (if the string is already sorted).
