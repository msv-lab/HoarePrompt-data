Reasoning:
The program is designed to decode an integer `n` back to a lexicographically smallest three-letter word. The logic is based on the constraints and the properties of the alphabet. Let's break down the logic to see if it correctly handles all cases:

1. **Case when `n > 52`:**
   - The maximum value for a single letter in the alphabet is 26. Therefore, if `n` is greater than 52, the smallest possible word must have the first letter as the largest possible value that fits within the constraint, and the remaining two letters as 'z' (which has the highest value of 26).
   - The formula used is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is correct because:
     - `n - 53` gives the index of the first letter in the alphabet (1-based index).
     - For example, if `n = 78`, then `n - 53 = 25`, which corresponds to the letter 'y'. Thus, the word is 'yzz'.

2. **Case when `n` is between 28 and 52:**
   - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the smallest possible word must have the first letter as 'a' (the smallest letter), the second letter as the largest possible value that fits within the constraint, and the third letter as 'z'.
   - The formula used is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is correct because:
     - `n - 28` gives the index of the second letter in the alphabet (1-based index).
     - For example, if `n = 52`, then `n - 28 = 24`, which corresponds to the letter 'x'. Thus, the word is 'axz'.

3. **Case when `n` is 27:**
   - If `n` is 27, the smallest possible word must have the first letter as 'a', the second letter as 'a', and the third letter as 'y'.
   - The formula used is `'aay'`. This is correct because:
     - 'a' + 'a' + 'y' = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27.

4. **Case when `n` is less than or equal to 26:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the smallest possible word must have the first two letters as 'a' (the smallest letter), and the third letter as the corresponding letter in the alphabet.
   - The formula used is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is correct because:
     - `n - 3` gives the index of the third letter in the alphabet (1-based index).
     - For example, if `n = 3`, then `n - 3 = 0`, which corresponds to the letter 'a'. Thus, the word is 'aaa'.

The program correctly handles all the cases and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` within the specified range. The logic and the conditions are well-structured and cover all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
