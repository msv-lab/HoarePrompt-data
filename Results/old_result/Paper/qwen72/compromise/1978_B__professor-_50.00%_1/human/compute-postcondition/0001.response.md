The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values during the loop execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
