Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the third condition. The formula used to calculate the profit when `b - a < n` is incorrect. Specifically, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` does not correctly account for the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

The correct approach should be:
1. If `b <= a`, then it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, then it is better to sell all buns at the modified price, which forms an arithmetic sequence.
3. If `b - a < n`, then the optimal `k` is `b - a`, and the profit should be calculated as the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price plus the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

The correct formula for the third condition should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{k \cdot (2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]
where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            profit = int((k * (2 * b - k + 1)) / 2) + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)
```

This corrected version will correctly handle all the given test cases.
