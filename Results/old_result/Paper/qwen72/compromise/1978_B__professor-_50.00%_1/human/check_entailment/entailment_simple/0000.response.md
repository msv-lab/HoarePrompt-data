Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b <= a` - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`, which is correctly calculated and printed.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b - a >= n` - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. This formula is correct for the sum of the first `n` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - **Case 3**: `else` - If neither of the above conditions is met, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price. However, the formula used in the program is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - (b - a) + 1) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(a + 1) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))
     \]
     The program's formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) / 2 \cdot (b - a + 1) + a \cdot n}
     \]
     This is incorrect because it divides `(b - a)` by 2 before multiplying, which is not the correct way to calculate the sum of the series.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given the incorrect formula in the `else` block, the program does not always compute the correct maximum profit.

Correctness: **False**
