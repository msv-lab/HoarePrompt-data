You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs `t` times, printing a result for each set of inputs. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input, and their final values after the loop are the values from the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and a result has been printed for each. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned in each iteration and their final values are those from the last test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price, where the price of the \( i \)-th bun is \( (b - i + 1) \) coins.
   - The remaining \( (n - k) \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the maximum profit:
     - **Condition 1:** If \( b \le a \), it means the modified price is not more beneficial than the usual price. Therefore, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit is \( n \times a \).
     - **Condition 2:** If \( b - a \ge n \), it means the modified price sequence can cover all \( n \) buns. The profit is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by \( \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2} \).
     - **Condition 3:** If neither of the above conditions is true, it means the modified price sequence can cover some \( k \) buns, and the remaining \( (n - k) \) buns will be sold at the usual price \( a \). The optimal \( k \) is \( b - a \). The profit is the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the arithmetic sequence plus the profit from the remaining \( (n - (b - a)) \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** \( b \le a \) is correctly handled by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - **Condition 2:** \( b - a \ge n \) is correctly handled by calculating the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the arithmetic sequence.
   - **Condition 3:** The program calculates the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the arithmetic sequence and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. However, there is a small mistake in the calculation of the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms. The correct formula should be \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Correcting the Mistake:**
   - The line `print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))` should be corrected to `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))))`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))))
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a minor mistake in the calculation of the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the arithmetic sequence.
- After correcting this mistake, the program should correctly handle all test cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the minor mistake in the calculation).
