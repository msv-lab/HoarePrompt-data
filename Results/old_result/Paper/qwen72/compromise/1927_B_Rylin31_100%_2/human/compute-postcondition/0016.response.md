The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each `s[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` has `m` elements (where `m` is the length of `array`), each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the cumulative sum of `s[j]` at each position in `array`, starting from 97 (ASCII value of 'a')**
