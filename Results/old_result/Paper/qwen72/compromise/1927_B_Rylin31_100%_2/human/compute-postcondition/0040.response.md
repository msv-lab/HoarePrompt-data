The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `array`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `array`. If `array` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element in `array`, and `array` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `array` must have at least two elements, and `j` will be the second element in `array`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`**
