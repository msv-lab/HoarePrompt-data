The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `array`. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, but the specific values of the input are not given. Therefore, the list `array` will contain a sequence of integers, each of which is greater than 0. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers, each greater than 0.**
