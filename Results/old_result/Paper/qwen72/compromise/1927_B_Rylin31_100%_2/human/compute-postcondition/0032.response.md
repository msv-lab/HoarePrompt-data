The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `i` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 2, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices that were in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appeared in `array`, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`.**
