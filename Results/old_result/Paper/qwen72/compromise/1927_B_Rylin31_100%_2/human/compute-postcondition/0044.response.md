Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` repeated three times.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` repeated twice.
- The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to the existing `ans`.
- Since `s[j]` is 2, the character appended is `chr(2 + 97)`, which is `chr(99)`, or the character `'c'`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains the character `'c'` repeated three times.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
