Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is now 2, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 2, `j` is the second element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` repeated twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is now 3, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 2, `j` is the third element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` repeated three times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
