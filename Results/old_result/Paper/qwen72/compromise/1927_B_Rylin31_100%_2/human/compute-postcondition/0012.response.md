Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where `s[j]` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `array` must have at least three elements, each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the third element in `array`, `ans` is the string 'abc'**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- `s[j]` is 2, so `s[j] + 97` is 99.
- The character corresponding to ASCII value 99 is 'c'.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes 'ab' + 'c' which is 'abc'.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
