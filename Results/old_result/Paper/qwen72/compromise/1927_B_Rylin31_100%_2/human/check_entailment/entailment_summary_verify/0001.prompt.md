You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the letter is determined by the current value in a list `s` of length `l` initialized to zeros. The value in `s` at the index specified by each integer in `array` is incremented after each mapping. The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged, and the program state includes the printed strings for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array `s` is used to keep track of the count of each character in the resulting string.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it determines the character to append to the result string `ans` by converting `s[j]` to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. This works because `s[j]` starts at 0 and increments for each occurrence, and `chr(97)` is 'a', `chr(98)` is 'b', and so on.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` to reflect that the character has been used.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Trace Array Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `a` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
  - For example, if `a[i] = 0`, it means the character at position `i` has not appeared before.
  - If `a[i] = 1`, it means the character at position `i` has appeared once before.

- **Character Assignment**:
  - The program uses the `s` array to keep track of the count of each character.
  - When `s[j]` is used to determine the character, it ensures that the character is assigned correctly based on the trace array.
  - For instance, if `a[i] = 0`, `s[0]` will be 0, and `chr(97 + 0)` will be 'a'. If `a[i] = 1`, `s[1]` will be 0 initially, and `chr(97 + 0)` will be 'a', but after the first use, `s[1]` will be 1, and `chr(97 + 1)` will be 'b'.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly reconstructs a string that matches the given trace array.
  - The use of `s[j]` to determine the character and then incrementing `s[j]` ensures that the character count is maintained accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string based on the given trace array and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
