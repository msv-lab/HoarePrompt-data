Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not already matched, considering the conditions in the loop. `tp1` is the index of the next unmatched element in `b` from the beginning, and `tp2` is the index of the next unmatched element in `b` from the end.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `max_heap` list is now empty, indicating that all elements in `a` have been processed.
- The variable `t` is reduced by the length of `a`, as it was initially set to `t - len(a)`.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are input integers.
- The list `a` and the sorted list `b` remain unchanged as they are input lists.
- The variable `ans` is the total sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not already matched, based on the conditions in the loop.
- The variables `tp1` and `tp2` represent the indices of the next unmatched elements in `b` from the beginning and the end, respectively, after all elements in `a` have been matched.
