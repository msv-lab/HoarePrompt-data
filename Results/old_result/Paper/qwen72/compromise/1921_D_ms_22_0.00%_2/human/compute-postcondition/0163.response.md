To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `max_heap` is an empty list.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop.
   - `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.

2. **Context**:
   - The loop mentioned in the initial state is not explicitly provided, but we can infer that it involves calculating the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and `b`.
   - The `ans` variable accumulates these maximum absolute differences.

3. **Loop Inference**:
   - Typically, such a loop would iterate over the elements of `a` and `b` to find the maximum absolute difference for each element in `a` with elements in `b`.
   - The indices `tp1` and `tp2` are likely used to keep track of the positions in `b` that are being considered for the maximum absolute difference calculation.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `a` and `b`.
   - Without the exact values of `a` and `b`, we cannot compute a numerical value for `ans`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the value of `ans` as described:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop)**
