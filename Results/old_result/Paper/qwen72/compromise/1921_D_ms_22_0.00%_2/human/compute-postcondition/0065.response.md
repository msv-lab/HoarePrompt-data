Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is a tuple containing one of the elements previously in `max_heap` in the form `(-diff, a[j], index)` where `index` is either `0` or `m-1`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
