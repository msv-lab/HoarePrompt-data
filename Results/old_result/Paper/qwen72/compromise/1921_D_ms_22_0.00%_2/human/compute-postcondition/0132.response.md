Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of `item[0]`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` (which is 0), then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. In both cases, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**
