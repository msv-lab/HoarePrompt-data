The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the negated value of the first element of the tuple `item` to it. Since `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, the value of `item[0]` is known. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the negated value of `item[0]`.**
