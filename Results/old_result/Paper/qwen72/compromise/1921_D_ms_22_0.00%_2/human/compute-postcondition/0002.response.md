The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This range ensures that `t` is already greater than 0, so no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module.**
