Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, and `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, so after the decrement, `t` is now `t - 1`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2`) retain their original values or conditions.
