Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing three tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**
