Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of the heap before the operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions for `tp1`, `tp2`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `ans` are still valid, but `item` now holds the specific tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**
