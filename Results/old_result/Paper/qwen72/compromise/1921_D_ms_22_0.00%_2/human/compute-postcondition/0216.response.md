Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed and must still contain at least one tuple, `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated based on the condition, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.** 

`max_heap` now has one less tuple, and `item` holds the tuple that was removed. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
