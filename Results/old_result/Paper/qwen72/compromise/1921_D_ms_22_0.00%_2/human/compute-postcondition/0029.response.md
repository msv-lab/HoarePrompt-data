Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers input by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers input by the user, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and `b[m - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` operation adds a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` to the `max_heap`.
- The `max_heap` initially contains one tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`.
- After the `heapq.heappush` operation, `max_heap` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
