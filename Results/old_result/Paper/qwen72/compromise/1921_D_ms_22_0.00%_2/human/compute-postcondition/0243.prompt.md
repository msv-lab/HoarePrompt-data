Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, where each tuple is either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated based on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is the larger of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to 0, `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with one tuple removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is updated based on the condition. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` if `diff1` > `diff2`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing tuples for each element in `a`, but with two tuples removed and must still contain at least one tuple. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. `t` is `t - len(a)`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user (assumed to be non-empty), `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` if `diff1` > `diff2`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2` and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans + -item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
