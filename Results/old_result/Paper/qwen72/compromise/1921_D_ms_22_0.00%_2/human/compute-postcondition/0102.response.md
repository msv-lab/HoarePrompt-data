Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is equal to `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `diff1 = abs(i - b[0])` updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between the second element of `a` (which is `i`) and the first element of `b`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `max_heap` is still valid, as it depends on the values of `diff1` and `diff2`, which are both still defined.
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0 but is still decreased by 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, and `diff2` remain the same as in the initial state.
