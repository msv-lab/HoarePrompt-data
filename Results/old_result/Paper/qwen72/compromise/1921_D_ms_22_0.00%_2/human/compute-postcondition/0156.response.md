Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.***
