Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and the first or last element in `b`, along with the corresponding element from `a` and the index from `b`. `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0. `item` holds the tuple that was the root of the max heap. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated by adding either `diff1` or `diff2` to its previous value. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. If `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, `tp2` is set to `m - 2` and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` (which is 0), then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.**
