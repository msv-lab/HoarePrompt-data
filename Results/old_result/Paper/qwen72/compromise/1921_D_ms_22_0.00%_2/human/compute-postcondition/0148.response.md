The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, which is a list. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

Since the state of `max_heap` at the end of the previous iteration is that it contains `n-2` tuples, and the loop can execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty, the condition for the next iteration to proceed is that `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple. This means `n-2` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2**
