Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` are the final indices of `b` after all iterations, which may have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.**

The code snippet initializes `max_heap` to an empty list, which was previously an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `tp1`, and `tp2`) are not affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.
