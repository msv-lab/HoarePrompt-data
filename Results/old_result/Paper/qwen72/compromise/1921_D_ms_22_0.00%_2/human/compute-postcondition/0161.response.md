Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, `n` must be greater than 2, and `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive), `ans` is increased by the negated value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
