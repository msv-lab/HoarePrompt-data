### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `b` is sorted, which is a necessary step to ensure that we can efficiently find the maximum possible differences.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap is used to store the differences between elements in `a` and the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - The heap is initialized by pushing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference, `i` is the element from `a`, and `index` is the index in `b` (either 0 or m-1).

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops the top element from the heap, which has the largest difference.
   - If the index of the element in `b` (either 0 or m-1) is no longer valid (i.e., it has been used), it recalculates the differences using the current valid indices `tp1` and `tp2`.
   - It then updates the total difference `ans` and adjusts the indices `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the heap, the program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The use of a max heap ensures that the largest differences are considered first, which helps in maximizing the total difference `D`.
- The logic for handling the indices `tp1` and `tp2` ensures that each element in `b` is used at most once, and the differences are maximized by choosing the farthest elements from `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
