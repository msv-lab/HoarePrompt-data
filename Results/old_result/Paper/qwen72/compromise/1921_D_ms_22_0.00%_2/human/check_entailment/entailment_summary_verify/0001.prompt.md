You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that has not been used in previous iterations. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the `max_heap` is empty, `t` is 0, and the final state of the program reflects the completion of all test cases. If the function is not executed as the main module, the variables retain their initial states.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The array `b` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements of `b` to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap (implemented using a min heap with negative values) is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, original_value, index)`.
   - For each element `i` in array `a`, the program calculates the difference between `i` and the smallest element in `b` (`b[0]`) and the largest element in `b` (`b[m-1]`).
   - The tuple with the larger difference is pushed into the heap. This ensures that the elements with the largest potential differences are considered first.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap until it is empty.
   - For each tuple popped from the heap, it checks if the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) is still within the valid range (`[tp1, tp2]`).
   - If the index is out of range, it recalculates the differences using the current valid range and updates the answer accordingly.
   - If the index is within the valid range, it adds the difference to the answer and updates the range pointers (`tp1` or `tp2`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - Sorting `b` and using a heap to prioritize the largest differences ensures that the program maximizes the total difference `D`.
  - The use of heap ensures that the elements with the largest potential differences are considered first, which is essential for maximizing `D`.
  - The program correctly handles the case where the index of the element in `b` is out of the current valid range by recalculating the differences using the current range.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case) by correctly outputting `0`.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m` (e.g., the third test case) by correctly calculating the maximum difference.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time, and there are `n` such operations.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.

Correctness: **True**
