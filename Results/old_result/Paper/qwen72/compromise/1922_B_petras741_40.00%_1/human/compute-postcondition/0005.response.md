Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. If `n` is at least 3, the function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The internal state of the function, including variables like `q`, `eta`, `rho`, and `res`, is reset for each test case and does not persist outside the loop. **
