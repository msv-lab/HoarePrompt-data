Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function.

2. **Function Definition**: The `func_1` function reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.

3. **Finding the Maximum Balance**:
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` using the `isqrt` function from the `math` module.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems that can be formed such that the sum of the difficulties is `x` and the number of sub-problems is `n`. The logic correctly maximizes the GCD by considering all divisors of `x` and checking the conditions for `n`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.
