The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `a` and `b` will have been processed `t` times, and the corresponding 'Yes' or 'No' results will have been printed for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
