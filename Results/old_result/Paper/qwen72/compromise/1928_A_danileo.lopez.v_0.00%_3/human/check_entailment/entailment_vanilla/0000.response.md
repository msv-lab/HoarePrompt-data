### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles such that the new rectangle formed is different from the original.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Explanation of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes" because Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \(1 \times 1\): Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, so the output is "No".
   - For \(2 \times 1\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect based on the problem statement, it should be "No" because the only possible cut results in two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles).
   - For \(2 \times 6\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle).
   - For \(3 \times 2\): \(b\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle).
   - For \(2 \times 2\): Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles and form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle).
   - For \(2 \times 4\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle).
   - For \(6 \times 3\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect based on the problem statement, it should be "Yes" because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle).

5. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. It should always print "Yes" in such cases because Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. It should always print "Yes" in such cases, but it prints "No" for some of these cases, as seen in the example \(6 \times 3\).
