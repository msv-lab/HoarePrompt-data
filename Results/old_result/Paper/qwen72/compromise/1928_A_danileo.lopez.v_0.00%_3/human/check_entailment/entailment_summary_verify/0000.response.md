### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in the context of the problem description:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reformed into a different rectangle.
   - A cut parallel to one of the sides must result in two rectangles with integer sides.
   - The reformed rectangle must be different from the original rectangle, considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No'.
   - The function does not return any value.

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are odd but the rectangle can still be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle.
   - The example given is a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle, which can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and then reformed into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The program's logic is based on the condition that if either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to form a different rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program outputs 'No'.
   - Let's consider the case where both `a` and `b` are odd:
     - If `a` and `b` are both odd, cutting the rectangle parallel to one of the sides will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions.
     - For example, a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles.
     - These two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles can be reformed into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(3 \times 3\) rectangle.
   - However, the program will output 'No' for this case because both `a` and `b` are odd.
   - This means the program is indeed incorrect for the case where both dimensions are odd but a different rectangle can still be formed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where both dimensions are odd but a different rectangle can still be formed.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
