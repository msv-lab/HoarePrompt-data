Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The previous values of `r` (which were integers) are no longer valid. All other variables remain unchanged.
