Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `y` being a list of integers where -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9 is no longer valid, as `y` is now a list of `None` values.
