### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to manipulate the array `a` and build the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always choose the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is present in `a` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is present in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` and checks the count of each integer `i`:
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The program prints the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once and is the second such unique integer encountered, or is the first integer that does not appear in `a`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that is not present in `a` or is the second unique integer, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic of the program ensures that the MEX is correctly determined by the time the loop breaks.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers in `a` are unique and appear exactly once.
   - It also handles the case where some integers appear more than once and some do not appear at all.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It processes each test case as required and prints the correct output.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
