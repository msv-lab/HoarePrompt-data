You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. The function prints the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N-1]` that either appears exactly once in `a` and is the second such unique integer encountered, or is the first integer that does not appear in `a`. If no such integer is found, it prints the last integer in the range. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `tc` is the number of test cases processed, `N` is the last input integer greater than 0, `i` is the index at which the loop broke or `N-1` if the loop completed all iterations, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of each integer in the last list `a`, and `a` is the last list of integers input by the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to achieve their respective goals.
   - Alice will try to include as many distinct elements as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including certain elements to minimize the MEX.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - If an element appears only once in `a`, Alice will try to include it in `c` to increase the MEX.
   - If an element appears more than once, Bob can always remove one of these elements to prevent Alice from including it, thus potentially reducing the MEX.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` to determine the MEX.
   - If an element `i` appears exactly once, Alice can include it in `c`, and the count `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (indicating that Alice has included two distinct elements) or if an element `i` does not appear in `a` at all, the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the elements that appear exactly once and counts them.
   - It correctly stops and prints the MEX when it finds the first element that either does not appear in `a` or when Alice has included two distinct elements.
   - However, the logic of stopping when `t` reaches 2 is not entirely correct. The MEX should be determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`, not by the number of distinct elements Alice has included.

6. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct approach should be to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a` after both players have played optimally.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest non-negative integer that appears exactly once, and Bob will try to remove such elements to minimize the MEX.
   - The correct MEX can be found by iterating through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` and checking if each value is present in `a`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic of stopping when `t` reaches 2 is incorrect and does not align with the definition of MEX. The correct approach should be to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a` after both players have played optimally.
