Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `N` is an integer greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `tc` is 1.
4. `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`.
5. `t` is 0.
6. `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
7. The count of `i` (which is 0) in the list `a` is exactly 1.
8. The current value of `t` is 0.
9. The condition states that either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```
print(i)
```

- `i` is explicitly defined as 0.
- The condition "either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0" is not relevant to the value of `i` being printed. It is a condition that might be used in a different part of the code but does not affect the value of `i` in this specific print statement.

Therefore, the value of `i` that will be printed is 0.

Output: **0**
