Postcondition: ***`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
