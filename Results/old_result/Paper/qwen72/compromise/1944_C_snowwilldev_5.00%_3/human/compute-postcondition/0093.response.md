Output State: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `t` is 1 or 2 depending on the count of the element at index 1 in `a` plus 1.** 

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
