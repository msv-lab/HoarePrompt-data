Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. The function prints the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N-1]` that either appears exactly once in `a` and is the second such unique integer encountered, or is the first integer that does not appear in `a`. If no such integer is found, it prints the last integer in the range. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `tc` is the number of test cases processed, `N` is the last input integer greater than 0, `i` is the index at which the loop broke or `N-1` if the loop completed all iterations, `cnt` is a dictionary containing the count of each integer in the last list `a`, and `a` is the last list of integers input by the user. **
