Postcondition: ***`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of `i` (which is 0) in `cnt` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `cnt` is exactly 1, `t` remains 1.***
