Postcondition: ***`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1 or 2 depending on the count of the element at index 1 in `a` plus 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0 or 1 depending on the count of the element at index 1 in `a`.***
