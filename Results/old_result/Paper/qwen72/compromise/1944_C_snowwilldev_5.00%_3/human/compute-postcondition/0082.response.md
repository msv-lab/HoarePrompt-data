Postcondition: **`N` is the new input integer greater than 2, `i` is 0, `tc` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`, `t` is 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. If the count of the element at index `i` in `a` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. The current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2, or the count of the element at index `i` in `a` is 0.**
