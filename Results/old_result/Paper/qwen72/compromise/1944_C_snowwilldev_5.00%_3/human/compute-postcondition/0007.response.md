Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values, `cnt[a[0]]` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[0]]` by 1.
- Initially, `cnt[a[0]]` is 1.
- After the code execution, `cnt[a[0]]` becomes 2.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `tc`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The state of `cnt` is updated to reflect the new value of `cnt[a[0]]`.
