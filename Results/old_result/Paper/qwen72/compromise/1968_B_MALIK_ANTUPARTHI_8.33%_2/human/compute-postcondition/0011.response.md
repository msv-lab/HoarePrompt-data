Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 1, `j` is 0, and the element at index `j` of `d` is present in the slice of `e` starting from index `k`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
