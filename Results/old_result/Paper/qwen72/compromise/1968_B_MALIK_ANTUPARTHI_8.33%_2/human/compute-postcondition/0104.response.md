The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the binary string `a`.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the binary string `b`.
  - `a`: A binary string of length `n`.
  - `b`: A binary string of length `m`.

The function returns a result for each test case. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. However, the specific return value based on the input parameters is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
