Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is a new input value, `j` is 0, and `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
