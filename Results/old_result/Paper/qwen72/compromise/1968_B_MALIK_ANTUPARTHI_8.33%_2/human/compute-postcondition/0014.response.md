Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, `j` is 0, and the element `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]`**

The value of `k` is now equal to the value of `j`, which is 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
