Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` and `c` are input integers.**

The initial state specifies that `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. The code snippet assigns the values of `b` and `c` based on user input, where the input is split and each part is converted to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` are now input integers, while the values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
