The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1, and `b` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is a new input value, `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` is the index of the first occurrence of `d[0]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
