Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `k` is assigned the value of `e.index(d[j]) + 1`.
- `d[j]` refers to the value at index `j` in the list `d`, and `j` is 1, so `d[j]` is `d[1]`.
- `e.index(d[1])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[1]` in the list `e`.
- `k` is then set to this index plus 1.
- The values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `j` remain unchanged.
