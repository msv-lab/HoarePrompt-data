### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment in detail.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` and checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` and checks if `b1` is not equal to `a`.
   - If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are even and the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original.
   - Specifically, it mentions the input `4 4` as an example where the program outputs `No` but should output `Yes`.

4. **Evaluating the Example:**
   - For the input `4 4`:
     - `a` is 4 (even), and `b` is 4 (even).
     - The program checks if `a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`, which is true.
     - It then checks if `a1 = 4 // 2 = 2` is not equal to `b = 4`, which is true.
     - Therefore, it prints 'Yes'.
   - This contradicts the original assessment, which claims the program outputs `No` for `4 4`.

5. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is even and the resulting split does not form the same rectangle as the original.
   - For the case where both `a` and `b` are even, the program will still correctly print 'Yes' if the split results in a different rectangle.
   - For the case where both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' because no cut can form a different rectangle.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the case where both dimensions are even and can form a different rectangle.
   - The program's logic is sound and correctly determines whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
