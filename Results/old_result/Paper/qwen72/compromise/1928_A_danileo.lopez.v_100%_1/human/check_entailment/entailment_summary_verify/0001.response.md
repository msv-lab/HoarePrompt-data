### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - After cutting, he can rotate and rearrange the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - The goal is to determine if the new rectangle formed is different from the original rectangle, considering that \(a \times b\) and \(b \times a\) are the same.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side. The new rectangle will have dimensions \(a \times 2b\) or \(2a \times b\).

3. **Checking if the New Rectangle is Different:**
   - The new rectangle will be different from the original if the dimensions of the new rectangle are not the same as the original rectangle.
   - Specifically, if \(a\) is even and \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \), the new rectangle \(a \times 2b\) will be different.
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even and \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \), the new rectangle \(2a \times b\) will be different.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \). If true, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "No".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints "No" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the program correctly handles it by checking if the other dimension is even and different from 1.

6. **Verification with Function Summary:**
   - The function summary confirms that the function reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of each rectangle.
   - It correctly checks if either dimension is even and if the resulting dimensions after cutting are different from the original.
   - The function prints "Yes" if a new rectangle can be formed and "No" otherwise.
   - The values of \(t\), \(a\), and \(b\) remain unchanged, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
- It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
