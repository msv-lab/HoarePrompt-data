Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one by cutting it into two rectangles and rearranging them. The key points in the problem are:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**: The rectangle can be cut parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **Forming a Different Rectangle**: The two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, but only if the new rectangle is not the same as the original one (considering rotations).

The program checks these conditions as follows:
- If either dimension `a` or `b` is even, it can be cut into two equal parts.
- After cutting, it checks if the new dimensions formed by rearranging the two parts are different from the original dimensions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
- If `a` is even, it can be cut into two `a // 2` by `b` rectangles. The program then checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`. If true, it prints "Yes" because a different rectangle can be formed.
- Similarly, if `b` is even, it can be cut into two `a` by `b // 2` rectangles. The program then checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`. If true, it prints "Yes" because a different rectangle can be formed.
- If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it is impossible to form a different rectangle, so the program prints "No".

The program handles all the test cases correctly and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
