The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is already in the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
