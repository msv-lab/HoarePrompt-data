You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output is the value of x - 1, where x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and prints the value of `x - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to be correct for every potential case. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `x`. It then sets `y` to `x - 1` and prints `y`. This approach is valid because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `x - 1` is always 1 (since `x` and `x - 1` are consecutive integers and thus coprime), and `1 + (x - 1) = x`, which is the maximum possible value for `gcd(x, y) + y` given the constraints `1 ≤ y < x`. Therefore, the program correctly outputs a valid `y` for each test case.
