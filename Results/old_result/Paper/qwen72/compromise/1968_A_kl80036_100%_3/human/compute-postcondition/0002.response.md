The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on these inputs is not provided.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `x` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not described.**
