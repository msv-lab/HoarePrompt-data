Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for `n == k`**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is a valid solution, and the function correctly prints "YES" followed by "1" and "1".

2. **Check for `n < k`**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. The function correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Main Logic for `n >= k`**:
   - The function initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - The idea is to create two stalls: one with a high price (`n - k + 1`) that ensures Alice buys a certain number of jewels, and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel to buy the remaining jewels.
   - However, the logic for calculating `h` and updating `n` is flawed. The variable `h` is supposed to count the total number of jewels Alice buys, but the way it is calculated does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - Specifically, the line `n -= i * curr` is problematic because it does not correctly account for the remaining coins after buying from the first stall. This can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output for `h >= k`**:
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function prints "YES" followed by "2" and the `costs` list. This is not always correct because the `costs` list might not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the function will set `costs` to `[7 - 3 + 1, 1]` which is `[5, 1]`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 6 jewels from the second stall, which is more than `k`.

5. **Output for `h < k`**:
   - If `h` is less than `k`, the function prints "NO". This is correct in the sense that if the calculated `h` is less than `k`, it is impossible to buy exactly `k` jewels with the given `n` and the current `costs` list.

Given the above reasoning, the function does not always produce the correct output. The logic for setting up the stalls and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
