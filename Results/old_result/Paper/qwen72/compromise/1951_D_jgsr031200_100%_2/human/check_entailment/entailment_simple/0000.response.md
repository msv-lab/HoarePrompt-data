### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Equality (n == k):**
   - If `n` (the number of coins Alice has) is equal to `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy), the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and is correct.

2. **Check for Insufficient Coins (n < k):**
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is a valid and correct check.

3. **Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The idea is to use the first stall to reduce the number of coins Alice has to a point where she can only buy the remaining jewels at the second stall.
   - However, the logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the number of jewels Alice buys is flawed. The program calculates `curr` as `n // i` and then subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. This does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The variable `h` is used to track the total number of jewels Alice buys, but it is not correctly calculated. The program should ensure that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

4. **Final Check (h < k):**
   - The program checks if `h` is less than `k` and prints "NO" if it is. This is a valid check, but the calculation of `h` is incorrect.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and the stall prices. This is also a valid check, but the stall prices and the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels are not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The program's logic for setting up the stalls and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed. The calculation of `h` and the prices of the stalls do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Specifically, the program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not a simple multiple of `k` in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Solution:
To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls with prices such that Alice buys one jewel from each stall. For example, the prices can be set as `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` (k times) if `n` is at least `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels, and the program should print "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(['1'] * k))
```

This version correctly handles all cases and ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible.
