Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, it is given that the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions; it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
