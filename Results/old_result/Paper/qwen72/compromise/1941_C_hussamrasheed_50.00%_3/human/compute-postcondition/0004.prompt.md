You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `t` should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the variable `m` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, and the variable `p` holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The sum `m + p` is printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are no longer in use after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each, but the specific output for each test case is not defined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
