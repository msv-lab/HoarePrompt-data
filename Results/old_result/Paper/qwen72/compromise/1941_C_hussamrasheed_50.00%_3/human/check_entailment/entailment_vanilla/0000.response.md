Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - We need to handle multiple test cases, each with a different string.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string.
   - Next, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program only counts and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" as whole substrings.
   - However, the problem requires us to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring in the resulting string.
   - The program does not consider overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still make the string ugly.
   - For example, if the string is "mappie", the program will count "map" once and "pie" once, but removing "map" will leave "pie" intact, and removing "pie" will leave "map" intact. The correct approach should be to remove the minimum number of characters to break both substrings.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring.
   - This can be done by iterating through the string and identifying positions where "pie" or "map" can be formed, and then determining the minimum deletions needed to break these substrings.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts and removes whole substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the minimum deletions required to break these substrings in the string.

Correctness: **False**
