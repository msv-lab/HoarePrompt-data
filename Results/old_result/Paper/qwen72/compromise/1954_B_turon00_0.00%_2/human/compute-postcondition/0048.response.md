Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**
