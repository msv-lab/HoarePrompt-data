Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the value of `cnt` to 0. The initial state specified that `cnt` could be either 2 or 0, but after the execution, `cnt` is definitely 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
