Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` is still a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and `n`, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- The variable `_` has been incremented by 1.
- The variable `aa` is still a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- If the list `a` contains only one unique element, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.
- If the list `a` contains more than one unique element, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
