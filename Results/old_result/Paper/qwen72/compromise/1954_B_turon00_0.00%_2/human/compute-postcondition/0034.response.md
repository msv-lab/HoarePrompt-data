Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. Since `tmp` was already equal to `a[0]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `tmp`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value was not specified, we only note that it has been incremented by 1.
