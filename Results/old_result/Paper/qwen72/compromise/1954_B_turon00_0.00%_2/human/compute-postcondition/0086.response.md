Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`, and `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `tmp`).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains the same input integer.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but this variable is not used in the loop.
- The set `aa` still contains the unique elements from the list `a`.
- If all elements in `a` are the same, `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`.
- If there are different elements in `a`, `ans` is the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list, and `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` (or 0 if the last element is not equal to `a[0]`).
