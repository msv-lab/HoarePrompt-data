Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
