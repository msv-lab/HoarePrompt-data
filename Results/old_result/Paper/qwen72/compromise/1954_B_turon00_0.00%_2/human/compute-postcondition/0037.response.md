Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions.***
