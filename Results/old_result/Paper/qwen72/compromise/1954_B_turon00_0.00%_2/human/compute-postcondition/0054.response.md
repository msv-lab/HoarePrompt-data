The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Based on the initial state, we have two scenarios to consider:

1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`.
2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.

### Scenario 1: `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`
- `ans` is `n`.
- `cnt` is 2.
- `ans = min(n, 2)`.
  - If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` becomes 2.
  - If `n` is 2 or less, `ans` remains `n`.

### Scenario 2: `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`
- `ans` is 0.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans = min(0, 0)`.
  - `ans` remains 0.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we need to consider both scenarios.

### Output State:
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` and `n` is greater than 2, then `ans` is 2.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` and `n` is 2 or less, then `ans` is `n`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is 0.
- `cnt` is 0 in both scenarios.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `aa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 2, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is 2 if `n` > 2, or `ans` is `n` if `n` ≤ 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.**
