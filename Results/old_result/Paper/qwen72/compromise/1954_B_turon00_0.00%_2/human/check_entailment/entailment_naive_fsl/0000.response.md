Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not composed entirely of the same elements but still meets the "beautiful" condition. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. According to the problem description, this array is beautiful because you can make all elements the same by performing the allowed operations. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to stop it from being beautiful. The correct output should be `2` because removing any single element (e.g., the second or fourth element) will still leave the array beautiful. You need to remove at least two elements (e.g., the second and fourth elements) to ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the count of the first element in the array and does not consider the possibility of other elements that could also be part of the "beautiful" condition. This leads to incorrect results for some test cases.
