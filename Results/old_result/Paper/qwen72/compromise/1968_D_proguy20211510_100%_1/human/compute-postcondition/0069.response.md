The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `paths`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths`. If `paths` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Since the loop has finished executing all iterations, `i` would have been equal to the length of `paths` at the end of the last iteration. To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be reset to 0, and `paths` must have at least one element.

State: **`i` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element**
