Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `paths` is a list containing the integer `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, and `pb` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, the current value of `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The loop or if statement we were directly inside is broken.**
