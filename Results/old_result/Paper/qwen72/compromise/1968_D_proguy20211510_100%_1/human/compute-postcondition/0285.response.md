Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of the list `paths`.
   - `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`: This means `pres` is the sum of the elements from the start of the list `paths` up to the `i`-th index.
   - `curr` is `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`: This means `curr` is calculated by adding the product of the last element in the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths` and the difference between `k` and `i` to `pres`.
   - `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop: This means `ress` is the highest value that `curr` has taken during the loop.
   - `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`: This means `resb` is at least as large as `ress`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Draw')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.
   - The values of `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
