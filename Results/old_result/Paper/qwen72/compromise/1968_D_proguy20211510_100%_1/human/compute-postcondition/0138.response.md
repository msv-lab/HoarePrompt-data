Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]` and the new element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
