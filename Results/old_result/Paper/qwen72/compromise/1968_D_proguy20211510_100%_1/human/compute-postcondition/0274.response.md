Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `curr`. If `k` is less than 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
