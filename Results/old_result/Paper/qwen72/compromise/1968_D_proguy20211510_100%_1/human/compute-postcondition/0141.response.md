Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the elements at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `ps` which are 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `k` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `pb` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `ps` is now the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from the initial `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered.
- The list `p` remains the same as it was initially.
- The list `a` remains the same as it was initially.
- The list `pathb` remains the same as it was initially.
- The list `paths` now contains the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from the initial `ps` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered.
- The list `vis` is now a list of `n` zeros, except for the elements at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from the initial `ps`, which are set to 1.
