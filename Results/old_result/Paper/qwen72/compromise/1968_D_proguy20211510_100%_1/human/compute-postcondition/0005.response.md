Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers, and `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**

Explanation: The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are converted from strings to integers using the `int()` function. The condition that `int(input())` must be a positive integer remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the code snippet.
