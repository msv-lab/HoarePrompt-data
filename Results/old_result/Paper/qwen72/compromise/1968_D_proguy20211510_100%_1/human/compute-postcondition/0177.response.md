To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(paths)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `paths`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element
- `pres` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1]`
- `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`
- `curr` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`

We need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(paths)`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `paths` has at least 1 element

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2
- `paths` must have at least 2 elements to ensure that `i` is less than `len(paths)`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `pres` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`**
