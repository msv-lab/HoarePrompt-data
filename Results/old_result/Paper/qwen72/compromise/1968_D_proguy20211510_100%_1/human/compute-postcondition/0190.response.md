Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`**:
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of the `paths` list.

2. **`pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`**:
   - `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of the `paths` list.

3. **`ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`**:
   - `ress` is the maximum value of the expression `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all valid indices `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`.

4. **`curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`**:
   - `curr` is the value of the expression `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`.

5. **`resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`**:
   - `resb` is a value that is greater than or equal to `ress`.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```
print('Draw')
```

The print statement is a simple string literal that does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **Draw**
