Postcondition: **The loop has completed all iterations, or it broke early if `k` was less than the length of `paths` at any point. `i` is equal to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the value of `i` at the point where the loop broke. `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, or the sum of the elements processed up to the point where the loop broke. `curr` is the final value of `pres + paths[-1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, or the value calculated up to the point where the loop broke. `ress` is the maximum value encountered in the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the maximum value up to the point where the loop broke. `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`. If `ress` is greater than `resb`, the current value of `ress` is greater than the current value of `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` is not greater than `resb`.**
