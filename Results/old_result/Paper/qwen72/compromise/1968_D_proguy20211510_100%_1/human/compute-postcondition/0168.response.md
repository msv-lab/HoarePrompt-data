Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `pres` plus the first element of the `paths` list multiplied by `k`. The values of `i` and the condition for `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
