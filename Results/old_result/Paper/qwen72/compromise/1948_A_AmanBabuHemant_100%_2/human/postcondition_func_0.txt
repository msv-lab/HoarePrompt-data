The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`). For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `t` and `n` are not retained after the function execution.
