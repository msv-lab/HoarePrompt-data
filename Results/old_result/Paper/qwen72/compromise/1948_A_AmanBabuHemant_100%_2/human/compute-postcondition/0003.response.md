The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might interact with or use external variables or inputs `t` and `n`, where `t` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= t <= 50 and 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that `t` and `n` are integers between 1 and 50, inclusive. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
