### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Character Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct the string.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the pair "AA").
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `1 <= n <= 50` because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - Since the length of `s` is always less than 200 for the given constraints, the program will always print 'YES' and the string `s` when `n` is even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and problem requirements. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the length of the string is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
