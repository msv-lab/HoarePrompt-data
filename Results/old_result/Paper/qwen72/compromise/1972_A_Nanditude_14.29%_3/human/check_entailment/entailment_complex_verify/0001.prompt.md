You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list containing two sublists, where the first sublist represents the array a of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) and the second sublist represents the array b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). Both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list containing the two sublists from `arr`, sorted in reverse order. Since both `a` and `b` are already sorted in non-decreasing order, the returned list will have the second sublist `b` first and the first sublist `a` second.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing two sublists, `a` and `b`, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a new list where the sublists are sorted in reverse order, meaning the sublist `b` will come first, followed by the sublist `a`. The elements within each sublist remain in their original order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b` until either `i` or `j` reaches `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced:
     - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
     - It then inserts `b[j]` into the array `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order. This is done by slicing the array `a` and inserting `b[j]` at position `i`.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented to reflect the new problem proposed.
     - The pointer `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed to make `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly identifies when a problem in `a` is too difficult compared to the corresponding expected difficulty in `b`.
- It then replaces the most difficult problem in `a` with the new problem of difficulty `b[j]` and maintains the non-decreasing order of `a`.
- The program ensures that the number of new problems proposed is minimized by always replacing the most difficult problem in `a` with the next expected difficulty from `b`.

### Issues:

- **Insertion Logic:**
  - The insertion logic `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` is correct but inefficient. It involves creating new lists and concatenating them, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.
  - A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search to find the correct position for `b[j]` and then insert it, but the current logic is still correct.

- **Unnecessary Function:**
  - The function `func_1` is not used and can be removed to clean up the code.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. However, it can be optimized for better performance, especially for larger inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
