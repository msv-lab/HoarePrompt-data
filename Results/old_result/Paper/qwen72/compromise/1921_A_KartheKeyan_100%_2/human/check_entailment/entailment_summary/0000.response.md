Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and the coordinates of the corners of each square. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this is not necessary for finding the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Sorting can lead to incorrect results because the order of the coordinates is important to determine the side lengths.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Side Lengths**: The program calculates the side lengths using the squared distances between points. However, it calculates the distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`). This approach is incorrect because the side lengths of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes can be directly determined by the differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

3. **Unnecessary Square Root and Rounding**: The program takes the square root of the squared distances and then multiplies them, which is unnecessary. The area of a square is simply the side length squared. Since the side lengths are integers, the area should also be an integer.

4. **Correct Approach**: To find the area of the square, you should:
   - Identify the side length by finding the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points.
   - Calculate the area by squaring this side length.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
