Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, the function still accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. `coord` is an empty list. `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state variables `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, and `range` remain unchanged. The new variables `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input.
