Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `n` is decreased by 1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.**
