The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `range(4)`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The range remains the same as it is defined by the constant 4.

State: **`i` is 1, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`**
