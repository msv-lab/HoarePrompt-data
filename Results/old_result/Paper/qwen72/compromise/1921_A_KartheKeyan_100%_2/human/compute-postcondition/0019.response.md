Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero.
- `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples: `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.
- `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.
- `i` is 3.
- `range` is 4.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`.
- `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(round(res))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `coord`**:
   - `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples, each containing two integers `(x, y)`.
   - Let's denote the points as `coord[0] = (x1, y1)`, `coord[1] = (x2, y2)`, `coord[2] = (x3, y3)`, and `coord[3] = (x4, y4)`.

2. **Calculating `p1`**:
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`.
   - The squared distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is calculated as:
     \[
     p1 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
     \]

3. **Calculating `p2`**:
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.
   - The squared distance between `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)` is calculated as:
     \[
     p2 = (x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2
     \]

4. **Calculating `res`**:
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Therefore, `res` is:
     \[
     res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2}
     \]
   - Substituting the values of `p1` and `p2`:
     \[
     res = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \times \sqrt{(x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2}
     \]

5. **Rounding `res`**:
   - The `round(res)` function will round the value of `res` to the nearest integer.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the rounded value of the product of the square roots of the squared distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points in the `coord` list.

Output: **round(res) (where res is the product of the square roots of the squared distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points in the `coord` list)**
