Output State: **`i` is 3, `range` is 4, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is an empty list, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord` (which is not yet defined because `coord` is empty), `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord` (which is not yet defined because `coord` is empty), `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2` (which is not yet defined because `p1` and `p2` are not defined), `n` is greater than 0**.
