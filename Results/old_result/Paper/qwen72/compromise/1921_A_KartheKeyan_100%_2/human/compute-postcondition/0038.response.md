Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 3.
2. `range` is 4.
3. `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers in each of the 4 iterations.
4. `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)` from each of the 4 iterations.
5. `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.
6. `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.
7. `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(round(res))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Iterations and Tuple Collection:**
   - The variable `i` is set to 3, but this is not directly relevant to the `coord` list.
   - The `range` is 4, meaning there are 4 iterations.
   - In each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers.
   - After 4 iterations, `coord` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing a pair of integers `(x, y)`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `coord` is sorted. The exact order of the tuples depends on the values of `x` and `y` provided in each iteration.

3. **Calculating Squared Euclidean Distances:**
   - `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.
   - `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.

4. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

5. **Rounding `res`:**
   - The `round(res)` function will round the value of `res` to the nearest integer.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the input integers for `x` and `y` in each iteration are as follows:
- Iteration 1: `x = 1`, `y = 2`
- Iteration 2: `x = 3`, `y = 4`
- Iteration 3: `x = 5`, `y = 6`
- Iteration 4: `x = 7`, `y = 8`

After sorting, `coord` might look like:
- `coord = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]`

Now, calculate `p1` and `p2`:
- `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`.
  \[
  p1 = (3 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8
  \]
- `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `(5, 6)` and `(7, 8)`.
  \[
  p2 = (7 - 5)^2 + (8 - 6)^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8
  \]

Next, calculate `res`:
- `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
  \[
  res = \sqrt{8} \times \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \times 2\sqrt{2} = 8
  \]

Finally, round `res`:
- `round(res) = round(8) = 8`

### General Case:
Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, the final value of `res` will depend on the specific input values. However, the output will always be the rounded value of the product of the square roots of the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second tuples, and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **rounded value of the product of the square roots of the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second tuples, and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord` list**.
