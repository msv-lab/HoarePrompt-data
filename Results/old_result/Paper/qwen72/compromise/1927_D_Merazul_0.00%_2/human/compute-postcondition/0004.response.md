The code `*_, k = R()` reads a line of input and assigns the last integer in the returned iterator to the variable `k`. The rest of the integers in the iterator are discarded. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now known to be an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer.**
