Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers.** 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer within the range 0 to 10^4 - 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
