Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` must be at least 1, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if `k + 1` is in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `u` is `True` if `k + 1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `k + 1` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`.**
