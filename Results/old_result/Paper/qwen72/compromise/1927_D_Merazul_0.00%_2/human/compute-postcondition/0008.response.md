Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is equal to `k // 2`, `a` is a set of integers, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer, `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is equal to `k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `m` is assigned the value of `k // 2`.
- `n` is also assigned the value of `k // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `q`, `k`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
