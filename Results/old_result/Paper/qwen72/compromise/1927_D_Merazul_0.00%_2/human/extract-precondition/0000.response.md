Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
