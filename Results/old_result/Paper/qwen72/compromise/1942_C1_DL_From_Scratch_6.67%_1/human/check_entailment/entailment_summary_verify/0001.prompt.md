You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It reads the number of test cases `T` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` integers. The function then sorts this list and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the list, including the gap between the last element and `n`. It prints the sum of these gaps plus `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices of a regular polygon. Bessie has already chosen some vertices, and we need to use these vertices to form triangles.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of vertices chosen by Bessie.

3. **Sorting Vertices**: The program sorts the list of vertices chosen by Bessie. This is necessary to easily calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.

4. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the number of gaps (`num`) between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1. This is because a gap of 1 means there is a single vertex between two chosen vertices, which can form a triangle with the two chosen vertices.
   - After the loop, it checks the gap between the last chosen vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic). If this gap is 1, it also increments the `count`.

5. **Final Calculation**: The program adds `x - 2` to the `count`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles. The `count` variable already accounts for the triangles formed by the gaps, so adding `x - 2` ensures that all possible triangles are counted.

6. **Output**: The program prints the final count for each test case.

**Verification**:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- The logic for counting triangles is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
