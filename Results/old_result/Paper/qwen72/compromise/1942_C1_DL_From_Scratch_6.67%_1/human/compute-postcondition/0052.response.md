Output State: **`list0` is now a sorted list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `count` is the total number of times `num` was 1 during the loop execution (if `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1), `num` is now `n - list0[-1]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 1, and `i` is `x - 2`. If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1.**
