Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from the input split by spaces.
- `y` is no longer 0.
- The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
- If `num` (which is `n - list0[-1]`) is 1, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(count + x - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `list0` and `count`:**
   - `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1.
   - For example, if `list0 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, then `count` would be 3 because the differences between consecutive elements are 1, 2, 1, 1, and there are three instances where the difference is 1.

2. **Understanding `num` and its effect on `count`:**
   - `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]`.
   - If `num` is 1, `count` is incremented by 1.
   - For example, if `n = 7` and `list0 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, then `list0[-1] = 6` and `num = 7 - 6 = 1`. In this case, `count` would be incremented by 1.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression `count + x - 2` is evaluated.
   - `x` is the number of distinct integers chosen by Bessie.
   - The final value printed is `count + x - 2`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `n = 7`, `x = 5`, and `y = 3`.
- The second line of input might be `1 2 4 5 6`.
- `list0` would be `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.
- `count` would be 3 (differences are 1, 2, 1, 1).
- `num` would be `7 - 6 = 1`, so `count` is incremented by 1, making `count = 4`.
- The final value printed is `4 + 5 - 2 = 7`.

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the result of the expression `count + x - 2`.

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1, and if `n - list0[-1]` is 1, count is incremented by 1; x is the number of distinct integers chosen by Bessie)**
