Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned new values from the input, `y` is no longer 0, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `count` is 2 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 1, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` is decremented by 1 but still greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `num` to `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.
- Given `i` is 2, `num` is calculated as `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
