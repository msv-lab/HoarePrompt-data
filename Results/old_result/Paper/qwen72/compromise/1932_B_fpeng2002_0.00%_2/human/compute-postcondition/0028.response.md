Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so it is now `t - 3`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
