Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each `a_i` is in the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
