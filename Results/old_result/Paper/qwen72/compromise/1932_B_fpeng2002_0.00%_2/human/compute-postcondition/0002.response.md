Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1`, where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. Since `num_tests` was initially set to `t`, which is in the range 1 to 1000, the new value of `num_tests` is `t - 1`. The condition that `num_tests` must be greater than 0 is updated to `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0 to reflect the possible new value.
