Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.
- The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The previous condition that `num_tests` is `t - 1` where `t` is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0 is still valid.
- The list `nums` still has at least one element, and `x` is still 2.
