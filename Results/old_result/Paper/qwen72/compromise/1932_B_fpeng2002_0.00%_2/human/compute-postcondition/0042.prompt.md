You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, t is in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each a_i is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the processing of one test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
