Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `num_tests` remains unchanged and is still `t - 2` where `t` is in the range 2 to 1000, and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged and must have at least one element.
- The variable `x` is now `len(nums) - 1`, which means it has reached the last index of the list `nums`.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` (`nums[len(nums) - 1]`) that is greater than the previous `start_year` value. This means that after all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the result of the previous iteration.
