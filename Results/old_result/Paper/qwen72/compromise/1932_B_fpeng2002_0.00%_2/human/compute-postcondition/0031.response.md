Output State: **`num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is 0, `nums` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `start_year = 0` sets the value of `start_year` to 0.
- All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `num_tests` is `t - 3` where `t` is in the range 3 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 and `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 0 is still valid.
- The precondition that `n` is the new input integer is still valid.
- The precondition that `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element is still valid.
- The precondition that `x` is `len(nums) - 1` is still valid.
- The precondition that `nums` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user is still valid.
