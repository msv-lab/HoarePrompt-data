The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. Each result corresponds to the processing of one test case. The exact nature of the processing is not specified in the given information, but the function will return a list of results based on the input test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the processing of one test case.**
