Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `num_tests` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer, which represents the number of elements in the last list of integers.
- The variable `nums` will be the last list of integers provided by the user, and it must have at least one element.
- The variable `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the value of `start_year` after the previous iteration plus 1. This value is calculated based on the final list of integers and the logic within the loop.
- The variable `x` will be the index of the last element in `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
