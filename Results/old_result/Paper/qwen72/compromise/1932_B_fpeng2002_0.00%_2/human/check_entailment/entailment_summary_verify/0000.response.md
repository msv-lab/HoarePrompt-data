Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program accurately follows the problem description and correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is the correct starting point for the first sign.

3. **Loop Through Signs**:
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.

4. **Calculate Next Year**:
   - The formula used to calculate the next year in which the sign will occur is:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign:
     - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs in a year strictly greater than the current year.
     - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity that have occurred up to the current year.
     - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
     - `* nums[x]` calculates the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The function summary confirms that the program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one and that the final year is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
