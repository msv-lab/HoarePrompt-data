You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings provided as input, the function calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the last processed binary string `s` and the original value of `t`, with the loop index `i` set to `t - 1` and the position index `j` set to `len(s) - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous pieces to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop.
     - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j+1]`, it increments `count`.
     - If the transition is from '0' to '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly identifies transitions between '0' and '1' and counts them.
   - The decrement of `count` when `flag` is `True` ensures that the last transition is not counted twice.
   - The program handles edge cases where the string is already sorted (all '0's or all '1's) by initializing `count` to 1 and not incrementing it unless necessary.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - For "11010", the transitions are at positions 2 and 4, resulting in `count = 3`.
   - For "00000000", there are no transitions, so `count = 1`.
   - For "1", there are no transitions, so `count = 1`.
   - For "10", there is one transition, so `count = 2`.
   - For "0001111", there is one transition, so `count = 2`.
   - For "0110", there are two transitions, but the last one is not counted, so `count = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
