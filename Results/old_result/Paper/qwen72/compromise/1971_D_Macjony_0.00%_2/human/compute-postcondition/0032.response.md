Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the characters are different. If `flag` is True, `count` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `count` is unchanged.***
