Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `count` is 2, `flag` is False, and the first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is updated to 1, `flag` is set to True, and the first character of `s` is '0' while the second character of `s` is '1'.***
