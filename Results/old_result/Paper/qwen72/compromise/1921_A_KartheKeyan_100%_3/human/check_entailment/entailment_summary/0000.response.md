Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The program sorts the coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates as a list of tuples does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For example, sorting could result in points being ordered by their x-coordinates first, which might not align the points correctly for the square.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`). This approach assumes that the points are already in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the sorting step. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the correct approach would be to identify the side lengths directly from the coordinates.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2` and then multiplying them. This is incorrect because the side lengths of the square should be the same, and the area should be the square of one of these side lengths.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated area for each test case, but the area calculation is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.
- The area of the square is the square of the side length.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
