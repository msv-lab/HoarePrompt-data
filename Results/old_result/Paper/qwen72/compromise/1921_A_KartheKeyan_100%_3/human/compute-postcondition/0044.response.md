Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list with at least 4 elements, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated values of `x` and `y`.
