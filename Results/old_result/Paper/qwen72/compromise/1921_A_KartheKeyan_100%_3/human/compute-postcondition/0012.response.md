Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user input. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The other variables (`total`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `x` and `y` while maintaining the initial state of the other variables.
