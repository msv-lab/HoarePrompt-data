Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The new tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to the list `coord`, which now contains two tuples. The values of `total`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
