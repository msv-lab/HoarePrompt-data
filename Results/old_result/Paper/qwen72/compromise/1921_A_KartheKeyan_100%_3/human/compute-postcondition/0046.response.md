The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `4` (the upper limit of the range). The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 3 (inclusive), so the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1.

State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the new element `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
