Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates and prints the area of each square. After processing all test cases, `n` is 0, and the function concludes. **
