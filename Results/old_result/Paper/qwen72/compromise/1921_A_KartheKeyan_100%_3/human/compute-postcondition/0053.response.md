Output State: **`total` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3.**

The `coord` list has been sorted, but the specific values of the elements in the list are not provided. The values of `total`, `res`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The expressions for `p1` and `p2` are still valid but will now use the sorted `coord` list.
