Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `total` is 0.
2. `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.
3. `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
4. `x` is an input integer.
5. `y` is an input integer.
6. `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
7. `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Analysis:
1. **`coord` List:**
   - Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple is `(x, y)`.
   - The list will look like `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]` after sorting, assuming `x` and `y` are the same for all tuples.

2. **Calculating `p1` and `p2`:**
   - `p1` is the difference between the first elements of the second and first tuples in the sorted list.
   - `p2` is the difference between the first elements of the fourth and third tuples in the sorted list.
   - Given that all tuples are the same, `coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]` and `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]` will both be 0.

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
   - Since both `p1` and `p2` are 0, `math.sqrt(0) * math.sqrt(0)` will be `0 * 0`, which is 0.

4. **Rounding `res`:**
   - The `round` function will round 0 to the nearest integer, which is 0.

### Final Output:
The `print(round(res))` statement will print the rounded value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
