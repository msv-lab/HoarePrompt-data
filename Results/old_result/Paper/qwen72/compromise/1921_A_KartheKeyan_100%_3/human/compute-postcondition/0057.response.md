To determine what will be printed by the `print(round(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements. Since it is sorted, we can assume the elements are ordered in a specific way.
   - `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers (though they are not used in the print statement).
   - `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
   - `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - `coord` is a list of 4 elements, each element being a tuple (since we are accessing the first element of each tuple with `coord[i][0]`).
   - `p1` is the difference between the first element of the second tuple and the first element of the first tuple in the `coord` list.
   - `p2` is the difference between the first element of the fourth tuple and the first element of the third tuple in the `coord` list.
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `coord` is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]`.
   - `p1` would be `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - `p2` would be `7 - 5 = 2`.
   - `res` would be `math.sqrt(2) * math.sqrt(2) = 2.0`.

4. **Rounding the Result:**
   - The `round(res)` function will round the value of `res` to the nearest integer.
   - In the example, `res` is 2.0, and `round(2.0)` is 2.

Since the exact values of `coord` are not provided, we can only describe the calculation in general terms. However, the output will be the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **round(res) (where res is the product of the square roots of the differences between the first elements of the second and first tuples, and the fourth and third tuples in the sorted list `coord`)**
