t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 \le k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 \le a_i \le 10^6. b is a list of m integers where 1 \le b_i \le 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
