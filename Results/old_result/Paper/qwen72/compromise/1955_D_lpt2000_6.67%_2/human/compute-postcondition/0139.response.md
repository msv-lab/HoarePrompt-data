Postcondition: **`cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `cnt_aa` is updated to a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are updated to the specific integers provided by the user, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 1, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `bb` that are not in `D` (updated to `cnt_bb - D`), `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `in_aa` is the element at index `m` of `aa`, `out_aa` is the element at index `0` of `aa`, and the value of `out_aa` is in the intersection `D` with a frequency greater than 0.**
