The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The string `s` consists of "U" and "D" characters and has a length equal to `n`, representing the initial states of the coins.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result is an integer representing the minimum number of moves required to make all coins face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. It returns a list of integers, each representing the minimum number of moves required to make all coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction.**
