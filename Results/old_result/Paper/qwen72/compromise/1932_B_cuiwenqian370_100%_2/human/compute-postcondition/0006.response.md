The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, but it does not specify that `T` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
