Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 1000. `q` is an input integer. `mn` is 100.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment of `mn` to 100.
