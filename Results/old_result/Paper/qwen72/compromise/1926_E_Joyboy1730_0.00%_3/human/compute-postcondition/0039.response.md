The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - sum(L)`, `L` has all its elements, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`**
