Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 1, `_` is 1. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` is updated to `k - tot` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables and list remain unchanged.***
