Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is 0, `_` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - sum(L)`, `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `tot` is `sum(L)`, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is 0, and `_` is 1.
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- After executing the code, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, `m`, and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
