The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0, None, False, etc.), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is `2^len(L)`, `m` is 0, `_` is 1**
