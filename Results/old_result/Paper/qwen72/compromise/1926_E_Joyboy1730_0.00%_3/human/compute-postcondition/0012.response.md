Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than 1 or less than -1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, and `n` is non-zero.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` was a non-zero integer greater than 1 or less than -1.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `L` remains an empty list.
- `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is updated to `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, which is equivalent to `n - m`.
- After the update, `n` is still non-zero.
