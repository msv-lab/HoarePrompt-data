Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and must be greater than 1 or less than -1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be non-zero.**

Explanation:
- `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is updated to `n - m`, which is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be non-zero is still valid after the update.
