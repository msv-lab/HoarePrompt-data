The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `L`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `L`. If `L` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `L`, and `tot` is `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `L` must have at least 2 elements, and `a` will be the second element in `L`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - tot`, `L` has at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is the first element in `L`, `pow` is 2**
