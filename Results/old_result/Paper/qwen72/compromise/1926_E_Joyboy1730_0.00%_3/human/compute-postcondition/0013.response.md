Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be 0, meaning the loop condition `while n` will no longer be true and the loop will terminate. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, `k` remains an input integer, and `L` remains an empty list, as these variables are not modified within the loop.
