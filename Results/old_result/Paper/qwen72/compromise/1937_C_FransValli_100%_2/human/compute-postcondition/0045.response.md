Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over. The variable `maxi` holds the largest value of `i` for which the input `res` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` is 0. The list `arr` contains all the integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations.
