The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are used and modified by the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'
- `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists
- If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `1`, and `res` is '<'
- If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `1`, and `res` is '='
- Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0`, and `res` is not '<'

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0` or `1`, and `res` is '<' or '=' or not '<'**
