Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The value of `maxi` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
