Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when XORed with itself, results in the maximum value among all such XOR operations, `arr` contains the indices of all elements that, when XORed with `maxi`, resulted in a value that is either equal to or less than the current maximum, and `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that, when XORed with `maxi`, results in the minimum value among all such XOR operations. `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop:
- `n` is the same as the input value for the current test case.
- `i` is the last index of the loop, which is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when XORed with itself, gives the maximum possible value.
- `arr` is a list of indices where each index corresponds to an element that, when XORed with `maxi`, resulted in a value that is either equal to or less than the current maximum.
- `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that, when XORed with `maxi`, gives the minimum possible value among all such XOR operations.
- `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed during the loop.
