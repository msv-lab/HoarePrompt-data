Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2.***
