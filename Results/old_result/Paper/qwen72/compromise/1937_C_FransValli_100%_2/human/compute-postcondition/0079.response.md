The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2.**
