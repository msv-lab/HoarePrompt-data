The only objects in the loop head are variables `item` and the list `arr`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. At the end of the last iteration, `item` was the third element of `arr`, and `arr` must have at least three elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least four elements. The next `item` will be the fourth element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` must have at least four elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is equal to the third element of `arr`.**
