The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string.**
