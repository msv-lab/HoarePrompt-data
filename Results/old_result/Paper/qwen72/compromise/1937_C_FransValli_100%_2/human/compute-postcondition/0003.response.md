The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0**
