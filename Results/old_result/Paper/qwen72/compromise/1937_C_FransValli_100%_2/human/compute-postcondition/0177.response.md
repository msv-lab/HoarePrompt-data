To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `item` and `arr`. The loop `for item in arr[1:]` will only execute if `arr` has at least two elements, because `arr[1:]` will be a slice of the list starting from the second element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
- `res` is an input string.
- `arr` will contain the indices of all elements that were either equal to or less than the previous elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`). If `res` is '<' for any element, that element will be the only element in `arr`. If `res` is '=' for any element, that element will be appended to `arr`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=' for all elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least two elements. This means that `arr` must have been modified to include at least one element beyond the first one. 

Let's break it down:
1. If `res` is '<' for any element, `arr` will be `[index_of_element]`, which means it will have only one element, and the loop will not execute.
2. If `res` is '=' for any element, that element will be appended to `arr`, and `arr` will have at least two elements, allowing the loop to execute.
3. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=' for all elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least two elements. This can be achieved if `res` is '=' for at least one element.

State: **`arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`**
