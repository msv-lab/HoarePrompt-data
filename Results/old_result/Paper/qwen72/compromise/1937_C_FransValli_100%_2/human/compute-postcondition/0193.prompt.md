Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string. The list `arr` will contain the indices of all elements that were either equal to or less than the previous elements in the list, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`). If `res` is '<' for any element, that element will be the only element in `arr`. If `res` is '=' for any element, that element will be appended to `arr`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=' for all elements, `arr` will remain `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is `>`, `mini` is set to the second element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` must have at least three elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is equal to the third element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` must have at least four elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is equal to the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
