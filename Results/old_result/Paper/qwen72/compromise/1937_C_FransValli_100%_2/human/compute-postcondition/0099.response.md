Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `arr` is `[2]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `2`, and `res` is the input value.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` reassigns the list `arr` to contain only the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The value of `arr` is now `[2]`.
- The value of `item` is updated to the last element of the new `arr`, which is `2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res` remain unchanged.
