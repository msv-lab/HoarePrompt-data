Let's break down the precondition and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
- `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
- `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
- If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1 and `res` is '<'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**: According to the precondition, `maxi` is initially set to 0. However, if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1. Since the precondition does not specify the value of `res`, we need to consider both cases:
   - If `res` is not '<', `maxi` remains 0.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1.

2. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.

3. **`flush=True`**: This is a parameter in the `print` function that ensures the output is immediately flushed to the console. It does not affect the content of the print statement.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

- If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.

### Final Output:
Since the precondition does not specify the value of `res`, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the task is to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 0 if `res` is not '<', and 1 if `res` is '<')**
