Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`.
- The value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x` and `y` is less than `lit[i]`.
- The length of `b` is now increased by 1, and the last element of `b` is now `lit[i]`.
- The conditions and values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain unchanged.
