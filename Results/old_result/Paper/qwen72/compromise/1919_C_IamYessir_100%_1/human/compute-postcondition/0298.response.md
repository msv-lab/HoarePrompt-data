Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]`), and `y` remains the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0).**
