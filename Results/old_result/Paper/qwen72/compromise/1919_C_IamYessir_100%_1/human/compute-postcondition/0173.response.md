Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. The list `b` now contains the second element of `lit` as its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 1, the second element of `lit` (index 1) is appended to `b`.
- The value of `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` and `y` are still determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.
- After the code execution, `b` is no longer empty, and its last element is the second element of `lit`. Therefore, `y` is now set to the second element of `lit`.
