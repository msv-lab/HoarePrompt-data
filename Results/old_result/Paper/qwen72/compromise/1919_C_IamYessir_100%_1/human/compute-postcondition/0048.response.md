Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is positive infinity.**

The value of `x` is set to positive infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` are still valid.
