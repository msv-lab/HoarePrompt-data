Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`). If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is now greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.***
