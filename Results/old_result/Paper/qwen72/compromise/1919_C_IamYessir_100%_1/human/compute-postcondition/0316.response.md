Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.***
