Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `b` remains unchanged.***
