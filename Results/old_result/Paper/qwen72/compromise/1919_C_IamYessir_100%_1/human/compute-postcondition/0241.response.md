To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but the state provided specifies that `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` meets this condition. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cp` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `a` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `b` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `s` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `x` is positive infinity (not relevant to the loop head)
- `y` is positive infinity (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is -1 (this will be adjusted by the loop to start from 0)

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, and `i` will be set to 0 by the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
