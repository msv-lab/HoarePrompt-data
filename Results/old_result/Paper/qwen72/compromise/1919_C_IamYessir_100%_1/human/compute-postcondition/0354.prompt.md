Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the size of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `b` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element in `a` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists containing elements from `lit` based on the conditions in the loop, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `x` is the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty, `y` is the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, and `s` is the total count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it plus the number of times an element in `b` is strictly greater than the element immediately before it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
