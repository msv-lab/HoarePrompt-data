Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`). If the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is infinity. If the length of `b` was 0 before, `y` is now `lit[i]` and was previously infinity. If the length of `b` was greater than 0 before, `y` is now the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`).**
