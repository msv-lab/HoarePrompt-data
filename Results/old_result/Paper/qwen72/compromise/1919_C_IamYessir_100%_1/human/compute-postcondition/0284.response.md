Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is set to infinity, `y` is set to the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is set to infinity.** 

The value of `x` is now set to infinity, and the value of `y` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions. The other variables, `n` and `i`, retain their initial values.
