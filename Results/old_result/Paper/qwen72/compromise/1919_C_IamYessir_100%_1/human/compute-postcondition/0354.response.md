Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `lit` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is the total count of elements in `a` that are strictly greater than the element immediately before them plus the total count of elements in `b` that are strictly greater than the element immediately before them.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, representing the total number of test cases.
- The loop counter `_` has reached `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
- The variable `n` holds the last input integer provided, which is within the range 1 to 2·10^5.
- The variable `lit` holds the last list of integers provided by the user.
- The lists `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order, meaning each element is greater than or equal to the element before it.
- The variables `x` and `y` are the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, or positive infinity if the respective list is empty.
- The variable `s` is the sum of the number of strictly increasing elements in `a` and `b`. This is calculated by counting how many times an element in `a` is greater than the element immediately before it, and similarly for `b`.
