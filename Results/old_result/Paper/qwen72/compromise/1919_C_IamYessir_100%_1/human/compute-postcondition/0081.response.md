Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `y` is set to this new last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, then `a` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `x` is set to this new last element of `a`.***
