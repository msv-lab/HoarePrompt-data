Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`), `a` and `b` remain unchanged in length except for the new element in `b`.** 

In natural language: The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `i` remains 1. The list `b` has the element `lit[i]` appended to it, making `y` equal to `lit[i]`. The list `a` remains unchanged in length, and `x` is still set to the last element of `a` (which could be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`). The length of `b` is now one element longer.
