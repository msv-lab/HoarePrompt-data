Reasoning:  
The provided program does not match the problem description in several ways:

1. **Function Definition**: The problem description suggests that the solution should be encapsulated in a function `min_new_problems(a, b)`, but the program does not define such a function. Instead, it directly processes the input within a loop.

2. **Logic for Inserting New Problems**: The program attempts to insert new problems into the list `a` when the difficulty of the `j`-th problem in `b` is less than the difficulty of the `i`-th problem in `a`. However, the way it inserts the new problem is incorrect. It pops the last element of `a`, then inserts `b[j]` at the `i`-th position, and increments the count `cnt`. This approach does not ensure that the list `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order after the insertion, which is a requirement of the problem.

3. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions `while i < n and j < n` are not optimal. The program should continue to add new problems until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The program should focus on maintaining the non-decreasing order of `a` and ensuring that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
