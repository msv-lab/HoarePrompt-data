Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Movement Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to move players and the Bludger. However, the function is defined with `mouvements` as a dictionary where the keys are 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D' and the values are tuples representing the change in coordinates. The function `func_1` should take the current position and the movement direction, and return the new position. However, the function is not correctly handling the movement of the Bludger, which is stored in the `players` dictionary as `'.B'`.

2. **Catching the Quaffle**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is flawed. When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal, the Quaffle should always reset to the middle of the field, regardless of whether the player is from the same team or not. The current code only resets the Quaffle to the middle if the player scores in the wrong goal.

4. **Bludger Elimination**:
   - The Bludger is stored in the `players` dictionary as `'.B'`. However, the program does not correctly handle the elimination of players when they move onto the same cell as the Bludger. The `if '.B' in players` check should be outside the loop that checks for player positions, and the elimination should be handled more robustly.

5. **Final Score Output**:
   - The final score is printed correctly, but the program should also handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown into the wrong goal correctly, which it currently does not.

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Initialize the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()

            continue

            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves

                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    del players[k]
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                    pointsb += 1

                if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                quidditch = [middle, '']
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]

        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch = [middle, '']
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch = [middle, '']

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected program addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly simulate the game according to the problem description.
