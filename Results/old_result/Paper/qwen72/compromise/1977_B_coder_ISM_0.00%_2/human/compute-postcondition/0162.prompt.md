Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings depending on the value of `flag`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is set to '1', and `s` contains 30 strings. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `s` contains 31 strings, `s[30]` is '1', and `length` is increased by 1. If `flag` is 0, `s` contains 30 strings, and either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. The variables `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30 or 31. If the first character of the string `s` is '1' and the second character is '-1', the second character of the string `s` is set to '0', and the rest of the string `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30 or 31, and the string `s` remains unchanged unless the first character of `s` is '1' and the second character is '-1'. In this case, the second character of `s` is set to '0', and the rest of the string `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30 or 31, and the string `s` remains unchanged unless the first character of `s` is '1' and the second character is '-1'. In this case, the second character of `s` is set to '0', and the rest of the string `s` remains unchanged. If the 3rd character of `s` (index 2) is '-1' and the 2nd character (index 1) is '1', the 3rd character is set to '0'. Otherwise, the string `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
