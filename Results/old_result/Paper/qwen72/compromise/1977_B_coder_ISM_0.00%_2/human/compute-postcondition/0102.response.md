Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 30 after the loop executes all 30 iterations.
   - `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0.
   - `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x` (from bit position 0 to bit position 29).
   - If the bit at position `i` of `x` is set (i.e., 1), the string `'1'` is appended to `s`; otherwise, the string `'0'` is appended to `s`.
   - The other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*s)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print(*s)` statement unpacks the list `s` and prints each element of the list separated by a space.
   - The list `s` contains 30 strings, each representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x`.
   - The exact values of the strings in `s` depend on the binary representation of `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be a sequence of 30 characters, each either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't determine the exact sequence of `'1'`s and `'0'`s. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **30 characters, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x`**
