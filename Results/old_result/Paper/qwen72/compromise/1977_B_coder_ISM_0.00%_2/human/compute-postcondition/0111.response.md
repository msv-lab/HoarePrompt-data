Output State: **`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, where `s[0]` is now '-1', `s[1]` is '1', and the rest represent the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x`. `flag` is 1, and the other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged.**
