Output State: **`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x` (from bit position 0 to bit position 29), with `s[0]` now set to '0'. `flag` is 1, and the other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
