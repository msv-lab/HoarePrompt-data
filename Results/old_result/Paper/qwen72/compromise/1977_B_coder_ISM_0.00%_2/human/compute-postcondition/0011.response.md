The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the sequence `range(30)`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The sequence `range(30)` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, and `s` is a list containing the string '0'.**
