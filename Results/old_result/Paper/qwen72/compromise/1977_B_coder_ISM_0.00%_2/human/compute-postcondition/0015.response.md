The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the sequence `range(30)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `range(30)` must still be a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0.

State: **`i` is 2, `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 1 in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1' and '1'. If the bit at position 1 in `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing the strings '0' and '1' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, or '0' and '0' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0.**
