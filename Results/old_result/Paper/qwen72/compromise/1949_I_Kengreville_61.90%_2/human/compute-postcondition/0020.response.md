Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `visited[j]` is `False`, `r[i] + r[j]` is not affected.**

The value of `dy` is updated to `y[i] - y[j]`. The values of `j`, `n`, `dx`, and `visited[j]` remain unchanged. If `visited[j]` is `False`, `r[i] + r[j]` is also unchanged.
