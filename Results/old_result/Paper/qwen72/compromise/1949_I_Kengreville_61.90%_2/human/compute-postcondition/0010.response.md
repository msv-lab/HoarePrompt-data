Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[0]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and the sum of `r[i]` and `r[0]` squared is equal to the sum of `dx` squared and `dy` squared, then `visited[j]` is `True`, `coef0[j]` is equal to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is equal to `-coef1[i]`. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
