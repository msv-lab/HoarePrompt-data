Postcondition: **If `visited[i]` is `False`, `j` will have iterated through all values from 0 to `n-1`. For each `j` where `0 <= j < n`, if `visited[j]` was initially `False` and the condition `(r[i] + r[j])` is met, the corresponding elements in `coef0` and `coef1` will be updated. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, or `coef1`.**
