Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with each element being an integer, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 0, the element at index 1 is 0, the element at index 2 is 0, and all other elements are `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 1, and all other elements are `None`. `nodes` is an empty list, `j` is undefined, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and the `dfs` function has been called with `i` as 2.**

The code snippet `c0 = 0` sets the variable `c0` to 0. Since `c0` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs to `c0`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
