The value of `c0` is incremented by the value of `coef0[j]`. Since `j` is the third element in `nodes`, and `coef0[j]` is 0 (as `coef0` has 0 at index 0 and 1, and all other elements are `None`), the value of `c0` remains 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 0, the element at index `1` is 0, and all other elements remain `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `0` is 1, the element at index `1` is 1, and all other elements remain `None`, `nodes` is a list with at least two elements, `j` is the third element in `nodes`, `ok` is `True`, `c0` is 0, and `c1` is `2 * coef1[j]`**
