Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `dx` is equal to `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is equal to `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is `False` or `True` depending on the previous iteration's condition, `coef0[j]` is now equal to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`.**

The value of `coef0[j]` has been updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
