### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` to store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - It also initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of visited disks and coefficients for the linear equations.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of disks in the current connected component.

2. **Connected Components and DFS:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to identify connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each disk `i` that has not been visited, it starts a DFS from that disk.
   - During the DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the squared distance between their centers to the squared sum of their radii.
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the neighboring disk and continues the DFS.

3. **Coefficient Calculation:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the linear equation \( \text{new\_radius}_i = \text{coef0}_i + \text{coef1}_i \cdot \text{new\_radius}_0 \).
   - The program ensures that the sum of the coefficients `c1` for the current connected component is non-zero. If `c1` is zero, it means that the radii of the disks in the component cannot be changed to satisfy the conditions.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all connected components, the program checks if there is at least one component where `c1` is non-zero.
   - If such a component exists, it prints `YES`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the DFS Function:
- The DFS function correctly identifies disks that are tangent to each other.
- It updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk in the component.
- The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that the disks are tangent, not overlapping.

### Analysis of the Main Function:
- The main function correctly initializes all necessary variables and arrays.
- It iterates over all disks to ensure that each disk is part of a connected component.
- The final check for `c1 != 0` ensures that there is at least one component where the radii can be adjusted to decrease the total sum of radii.

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables:** The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used as global variables within the `dfs` function. This is generally not a good practice, but in this context, it does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Edge Cases:** The program assumes that the input is valid and within the specified constraints. It does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly, but this is not required by the problem description.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program correctly initializes the necessary lists and reads the input.
- The DFS function correctly updates the `visited` list and appends indices to the `nodes` list.
- The main function correctly calculates the sum of coefficients `c0` and `c1` for each connected component and sets `ok` to `True` if `c1` is non-zero for any component.
- The final state of the program is consistent with the problem requirements, and the output is determined based on the value of `ok`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases. The use of DFS to identify connected components and the coefficient calculation are appropriate for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
