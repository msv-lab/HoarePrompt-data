You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the disk at index `i`. If the disk at index `i` has not been visited, it marks it as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list. For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is exactly touching the disk at index `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`. The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists, and the `nodes` list, but does not change the `x`, `y`, or `r` lists. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will have `True` for all disks that are part of the same connected component as the disk at index `i`, and the `nodes` list will contain the indices of these visited disks in the order they were visited. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated to reflect the coefficients for the disks in the connected component.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to use a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the logic in the `dfs` function and the main function `func_1` is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **DFS Logic**:
   - The `dfs` function is supposed to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the way it updates `coef0` and `coef1` is not clearly defined and does not guarantee that the sum of radii will strictly decrease.
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the program does not correctly propagate the changes in radii to ensure that the sum of radii decreases.

2. **Sum of Radii**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sum of radii can be strictly decreased. It only checks if `c1 != 0`, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that the sum of radii decreases.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the disks are not connected in a single component. For example, if there are multiple isolated groups of disks, the program may incorrectly determine that it is possible to decrease the sum of radii.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
3 0 1
6 0 1
```
- The disks are arranged in a line with integer coordinates and radii, and they are tangent to each other.
- The program should determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

In this case, the program will output `YES` because it finds a non-zero `c1` value, but it does not actually check if the sum of radii can be decreased. The correct output should be `NO` because it is not possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
