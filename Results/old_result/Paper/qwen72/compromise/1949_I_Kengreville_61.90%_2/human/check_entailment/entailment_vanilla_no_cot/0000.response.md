Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided attempts to solve the problem using a depth-first search (DFS) to identify connected components of tangent disks and then checks if it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency conditions. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Global Variables and Function Scope:**
   - The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used in `func_1` but are not passed to `dfs`. This can lead to issues with variable scope and potential bugs. In Python, these variables should be passed as arguments to `dfs` to ensure they are correctly scoped.

2. **DFS Logic:**
   - The DFS function is supposed to update the `coef0` and `coef1` values for each disk in a connected component. However, the logic for updating `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` is incorrect. Specifically, the line `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` does not correctly account for the relationship between the radii of tangent disks. This should be based on the tangency condition, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

3. **Sum of Radii Check:**
   - The program checks if `c1 != 0` to determine if the sum of radii can be decreased. This is not a sufficient condition to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The correct approach would be to check if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii in the connected component can be reduced while maintaining the tangency conditions.

4. **Handling of Tangent Disks:**
   - The program checks for tangency using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. This is correct, but the program does not handle the case where the sum of the radii of tangent disks can be adjusted to maintain tangency while reducing the total sum of radii.

5. **DFS Call:**
   - The `dfs` function is called within `func_1` but does not pass the necessary arguments. This will lead to a `NameError` because `dfs` will not have access to the variables it needs.

To correct the program, you would need to:

- Pass the necessary variables to the `dfs` function.
- Correct the logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` to properly handle the tangency conditions.
- Ensure that the sum of radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining the tangency conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i, x, y, r, visited, coef0, coef1, nodes)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            if c1 != 0:
                ok = True
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def dfs(i, x, y, r, visited, coef0, coef1, nodes):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = coef0[i] + r[i] + r[j]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j, x, y, r, visited, coef0, coef1, nodes)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

However, the above correction still needs further refinement to ensure that the sum of radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining the tangency conditions. The logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` needs to be carefully designed to ensure that the changes to the radii are valid.
