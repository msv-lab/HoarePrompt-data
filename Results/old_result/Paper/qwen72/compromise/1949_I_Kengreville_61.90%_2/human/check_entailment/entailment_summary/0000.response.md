### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.
   - It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to track the state of each disk. `visited` is used to mark disks that have been processed, `coef0` and `coef1` are used to store coefficients for a system of linear equations.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - `dfs` is a helper function that performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk `i`.
   - It marks the disk `i` as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - For each other disk `j` that has not been visited and is exactly touching the disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

3. **Connected Components and Coefficients**:
   - `func_1` iterates through each disk and, if it has not been visited, starts a DFS traversal from that disk.
   - During the DFS traversal, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for each disk in the connected component.
   - After the DFS traversal, it checks if the cumulative sum of `coef1` values for the connected component is non-zero. If it is, it sets `ok` to `True`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - `func_1` prints 'YES' if `ok` is `True` (i.e., if there is at least one connected component where the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero), and 'NO' otherwise.

### Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition**: The program correctly identifies disks that are tangent to each other using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`. This ensures that the distance between the centers of two disks is exactly equal to the sum of their radii, which is the definition of tangency.

- **Connected Components**: The program uses DFS to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. This is a valid approach to group disks that are part of the same tangency network.

- **Coefficient Calculation**: The program updates `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk in the connected component. The coefficients are used to form a system of linear equations that can be solved to determine if the radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency and reducing the total sum of radii.

- **Sum of Coefficients**: The program checks if the sum of `coef1` values for any connected component is non-zero. If the sum is non-zero, it means that there is a way to adjust the radii of the disks in that component to strictly decrease the total sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. It correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks, calculates the necessary coefficients, and checks if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
