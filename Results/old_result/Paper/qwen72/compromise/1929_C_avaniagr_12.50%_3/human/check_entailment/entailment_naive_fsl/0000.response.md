Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required (`z`) is flawed. The loop that calculates `z` does not correctly simulate the required number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can always achieve at least `n` coins.

For example, consider the test case `k = 2`, `x = 1`, and `a = 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row. If Sasha starts with 1 coin and loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins and cannot place any more bets. Therefore, he cannot guarantee having any number of coins `n` greater than 1. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for this case because it does not correctly account for the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can always win.

The correct logic should be more complex, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses and the multiplier `k` to ensure that Sasha can always recover and reach any desired number of coins `n`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
