You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the integers provided by the user input. If `x` < `k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed. If `x` == `k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 3` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed. If `x` > `k - 1`, `z` has been calculated as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and the condition `a >= z` has been checked and the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is designed to operate with external inputs or predefined variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
