The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `_`.

Output: **YES**
