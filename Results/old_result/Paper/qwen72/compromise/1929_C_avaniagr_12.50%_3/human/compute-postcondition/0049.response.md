Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30.
   - `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100.
   - `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9.
   - `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `z` is the result of the loop after `x + 1` iterations.
   - `i` is `x`.
   - `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It is a static string output.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is printing a static string, the output will always be `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
