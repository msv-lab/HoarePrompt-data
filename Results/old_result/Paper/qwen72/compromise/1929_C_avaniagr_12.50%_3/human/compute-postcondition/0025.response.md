Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.**
