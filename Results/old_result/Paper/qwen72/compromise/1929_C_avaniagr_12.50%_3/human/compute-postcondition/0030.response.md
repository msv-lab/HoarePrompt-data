Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30, `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100, and `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `k + 2`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is set to `x + 1`, `i` is set to `x`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `z`.***
