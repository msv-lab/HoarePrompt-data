The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to work with external inputs or predefined variables within the context where it is called. These parameters are `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, and `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output or return value is not provided in the given context.

Functionality: **The function is designed to operate with external inputs or predefined variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
