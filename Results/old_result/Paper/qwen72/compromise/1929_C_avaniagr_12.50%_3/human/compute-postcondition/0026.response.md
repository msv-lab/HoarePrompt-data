Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `k` is an input integer where 2 <= `k` <= 30.
   - `x` is an input integer where 1 <= `x` <= 100.
   - `x` is greater than `k - 1`.
   - `a` is an input integer where 1 <= `a` <= 10^9.
   - `z` is `x + 1`.
   - `i` is `x`.
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, and `i` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `a` is greater than or equal to `z` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **YES**
