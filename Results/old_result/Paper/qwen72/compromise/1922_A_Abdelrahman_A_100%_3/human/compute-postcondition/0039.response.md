Output State: **`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is an input string. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `c`, and `no` is True if no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`. If `no` is True, it indicates that `c` is not equal to `a` or `b` and no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`.**
