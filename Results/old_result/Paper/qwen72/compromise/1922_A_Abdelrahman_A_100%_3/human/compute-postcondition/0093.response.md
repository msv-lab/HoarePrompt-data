Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `tests` must be greater than 2
- `slength` is an input integer
- `a` is a new input string
- `b` is a new input string
- `c` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters
- `counter` is 2
- `x` is the third character in `c`
- `no` is False

Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

Explanation:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
