Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). `tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `c`, and `no` is True if no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`. If `no` is True, it indicates that `c` is not equal to `a` or `b` and no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `tests` must be greater than 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or if no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, then `no` is True. Otherwise, if any character in `c` is found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`, `no` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If `no` was initially True, it remains True after the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
