Based on the initial state provided, let's analyze the print statement:

- `i` is 1.
- `tests` must be greater than 1.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `c` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character.
- `no` is False.
- `counter` is 0.
- The character `x` is not present in the first character of `a` and the first character of `b`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement because it does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
