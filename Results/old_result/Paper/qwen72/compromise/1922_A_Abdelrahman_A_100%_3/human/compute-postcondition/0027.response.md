The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed:

- `i` is 0.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `c` is an input string that must have at least three characters, and `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`.
- `counter` is 2.
- `x` is the third character of `c`.
- `no` is False.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string 'YES' is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided.

Output: **YES**
