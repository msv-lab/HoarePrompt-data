Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `c` is an input string and `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`.
- `no` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The value of `no` is False, but this does not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not conditional on `no`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects.

Output: **NO**
