Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over `t` test cases, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, the function prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the modified price is not greater than the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, the function prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is the correct profit if Bob sells all buns at the modified price.
   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the function prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This formula calculates the profit from selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. This is also correct because it maximizes the profit by selling as many buns as possible at the modified price before switching to the usual price.

3. **Output**: The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where `b` is very large or very small relative to `a` and `n`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `b` is exactly equal to `a`.

5. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**: The use of integer division `//` ensures that the results are integers, which is appropriate for the problem's context of counting coins.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
