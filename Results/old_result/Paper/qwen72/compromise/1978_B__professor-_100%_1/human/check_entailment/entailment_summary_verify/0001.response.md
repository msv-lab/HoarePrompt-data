### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks three conditions to determine the maximum profit:
     - **Condition 1:** `if b <= a`
       - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
       - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif b - a >= n`
       - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
       - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
       - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`.
     - **Condition 3:** `else`
       - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means the optimal `k` is `b - a` (since `b - a` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a higher price than `a`).
       - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
       - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
       - The profit from the remaining buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `b <= a`, selling all buns at `a` is the best strategy.
     - This is correct because if the modified price is not higher than the usual price, there is no benefit in using the modified price.
   - **Condition 2:** If `b - a >= n`, selling all buns at the modified price is the best strategy.
     - This is correct because if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, Bob can sell all buns at a higher price than `a` and maximize profit.
   - **Condition 3:** If `b - a < n`, the optimal `k` is `b - a`, and the profit is calculated as described.
     - This is correct because selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price maximizes the profit.

4. **Checking the Formulas:**
   - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`.
     - This is the correct formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
     - This is the correct formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic series.
   - The profit from the remaining buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
     - This is the correct formula for the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their minimum or maximum values correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `b` is exactly equal to `a` or where `b - a` is exactly equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases described in the problem. The logic and formulas used are accurate for calculating the maximum profit.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
