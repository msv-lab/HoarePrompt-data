The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to a value before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and will be assigned values from 0 to t-1**
