The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated result for each of the `t` test cases. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and the program state is as it was before the function call, except for the printed outputs.
