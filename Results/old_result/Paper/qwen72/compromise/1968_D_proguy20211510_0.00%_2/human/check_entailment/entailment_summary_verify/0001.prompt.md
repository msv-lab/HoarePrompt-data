You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of game scenarios, each defined by the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of two players Bodya (`P_B`) and Sasha (`P_S`), a permutation `p`, and an array of integers `a`. For each test case, the function determines the winner of the game or if it ends in a draw based on the values in `a` and the movement of positions in `p` over `k` turns. The function outputs 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, reflecting the final state of the game. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the positions and scores of both players.
   - If a player reaches the position with the maximum value in `a`, they stay at that position for the remaining turns, adding the maximum value to their score each turn.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for both players after each turn.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores by adding the maximum value for the remaining turns if a player has already found the maximum value.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Initial Checks:**
  - These checks are correct and handle the edge cases where one or both players start at the maximum value position.
  
- **Game Simulation:**
  - The simulation logic is correct. It correctly updates the positions and scores of both players based on the rules of the game.
  - The program correctly handles the case where a player reaches the maximum value position and stays there for the remaining turns.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The cumulative scores are calculated correctly.
  - The potential final scores are also calculated correctly by adding the maximum value for the remaining turns.

- **Determine the Winner:**
  - The final comparison of scores is correct and follows the rules of the game.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are not used in the program and can be removed to clean up the code.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program could be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations, especially in the case where one player has already found the maximum value position and the game can be determined early.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the rules of the game as described. The initial checks and the game simulation are implemented correctly, and the final score comparison is also correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
