Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the players will always move to the position with the maximum score in the array `a` once they encounter it. However, the rules of the game state that on each turn, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position `p_x` (where `x` is their current position). This means the players can potentially cycle through positions in the permutation, and the program does not account for this behavior.

**Example Case:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Initial positions:**
  - Bodya: `p_3 = 2`
  - Sasha: `p_2 = 1`

- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya's score: `a_3 = 5`
  - Bodya moves to `p_3 = 2`
  - Sasha's score: `a_2 = 2`
  - Sasha moves to `p_2 = 1`

- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya's score: `5 + a_2 = 5 + 2 = 7`
  - Bodya stays at `p_2 = 1`
  - Sasha's score: `2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9`
  - Sasha stays at `p_1 = 4`

The correct output should be "Sasha" because Sasha ends up with a higher score (9) than Bodya (7). However, the given program will output "Bodya" because it incorrectly assumes that once a player finds the maximum score, they will always stay at that position. This is not in line with the game rules, which allow players to move to `p_x` on each turn.
