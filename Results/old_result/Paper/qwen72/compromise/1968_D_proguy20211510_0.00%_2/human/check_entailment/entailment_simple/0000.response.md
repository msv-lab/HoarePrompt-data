Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases. It splits the input and converts the necessary parts to integers.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function checks if either Bodya or Sasha is already at the maximum score position at the start. If both are at the maximum score position, it prints 'Draw'. If only one is at the maximum score position, it prints the winner. This is a valid optimization and simplification for the problem.

3. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha over the `k` turns. It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for each turn. It also uses boolean flags `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has reached the maximum score position and stays there.

4. **Optimization for Maximum Score**: If both players have reached the maximum score position, the function adds the remaining turns' scores as `maxa` to both lists. This is a valid optimization because once a player reaches the maximum score position, they can stay there and keep adding the maximum score.

5. **Prefix Sums**: The function calculates the prefix sums of the scores for each player using the lists `preb` and `pres`. This is necessary to determine the cumulative scores at each turn.

6. **Final Scores**: The function calculates the final scores for each player by adding the remaining turns' scores to the prefix sums. It then determines the winner based on the maximum final scores.

7. **Output**: The function correctly prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the final scores.

However, there are a few issues and potential improvements:

1. **Unused Variables**: The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the function. These can be removed to clean up the code.

2. **Complexity**: The function calculates the scores for each turn and then the final scores, which can be optimized. The game can be simplified by recognizing that the scores will eventually stabilize once a player reaches the maximum score position.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle the case where the permutation might have cycles or loops that could affect the score calculation. However, the problem description implies that the permutation and the game rules are such that this should not be an issue.

Given the above reasoning, the function is mostly correct but can be optimized and cleaned up. However, for the given problem and inputs, the function should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
