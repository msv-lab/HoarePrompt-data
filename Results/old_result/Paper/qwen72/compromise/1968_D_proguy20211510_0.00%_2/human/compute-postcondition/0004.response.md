Output State: **The loop will have completed its execution for all test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` will have been updated and used to determine the winner of each game. The final output will be a series of 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, based on the conditions provided in the loop. The values of `MOD` and `alpha` remain unchanged.**
