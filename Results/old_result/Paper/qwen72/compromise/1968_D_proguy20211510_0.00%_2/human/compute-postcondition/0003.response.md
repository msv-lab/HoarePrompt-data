The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder and will be set to the values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1` during the loop iterations.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
