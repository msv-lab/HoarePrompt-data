The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2`. The function then prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.
