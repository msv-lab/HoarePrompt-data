The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250. `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. `p` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100. `qs` is a list of `q` integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.

The function returns a list of results based on the input parameters. Each result corresponds to an integer in the list `qs` and indicates whether that integer is present in the list `p`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It returns a list of results where each result indicates whether an integer from the list `qs` is present in the list `p`.**
