The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `qs`. For the loop to execute, `qs` must contain at least one integer. The variable `n` will be set to the first integer in `qs` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer in `qs`**
