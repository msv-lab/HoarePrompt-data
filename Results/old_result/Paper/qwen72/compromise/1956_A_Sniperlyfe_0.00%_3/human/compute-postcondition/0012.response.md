The only objects in the loop head are variables `n` and list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the next integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` must have at least 2 integers, `n` is the second integer in `qs`, and `res` now contains an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 3 integers, and `n` will be the third integer in `qs`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, `n` is the third integer in `qs`**
