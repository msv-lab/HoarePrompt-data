The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
