To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will convert each element in the list `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - It will then join these string elements with a space character to form a single string.
   - Finally, it will print this single string.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `res` is determined by the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of the list `qs`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in `res`.
   - However, we know that `res` is a list of integers resulting from the function `func_1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the list `res`.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the list of integers resulting from func_1(n, p) and n is the first element of the list qs)**
