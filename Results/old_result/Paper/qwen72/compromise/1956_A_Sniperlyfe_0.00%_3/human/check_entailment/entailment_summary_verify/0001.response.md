### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to simulate a game where players are removed from a line based on a sequence of positions `a` until no more players can be removed.
   - We need to determine the number of winners for multiple initial player counts `n_i`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function correctly simulates the rounds of the game.
   - It takes `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to kick out).
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it subtracts the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`.
   - This effectively simulates the rounds of the game where players are kicked out.
   - Once the loop exits, the remaining value of `n` is the number of players who are not kicked out and are declared as winners.
   - The function returns this remaining value, which is correct.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the length of the sequence `a` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` and the list of queries `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - The original function has a print statement inside the loop, which prints the results for each query individually. This is incorrect because it should print all results for a test case in a single line.

4. **Corrected Function 2:**
   - The print statement should be moved outside the loop to ensure that all results for a test case are printed in a single line.
   - The corrected function is as follows:
   ```python
   def func_2():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
           p = list(map(int, input().split()))
           qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
           res = []
           for n in qs:
               res.append(func_1(n, p))
           print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

5. **Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game and returns the number of winners.
   - The corrected `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each test case in a single line.
   - The function summaries and the problem description support the correctness of the logic in both functions.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was correct in identifying the issue with the print statement in `func_2`.
- The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The corrected `func_2` addresses the issue and ensures the correct output format.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the print statement issue in `func_2`.)
