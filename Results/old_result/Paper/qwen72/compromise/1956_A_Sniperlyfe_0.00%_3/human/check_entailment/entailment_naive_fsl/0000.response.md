Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` prints the results immediately after each query is processed, rather than collecting all results for a test case and printing them together at the end. This means that the output format is incorrect, as it does not match the expected output format where all results for a test case are printed on a single line.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where there are multiple test cases. The `func_2` function should process each test case independently and print the results for each test case on a separate line. However, the current implementation will mix the results of different test cases, leading to incorrect output.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
2 1
3 5
5
5 3
2 4 6 7 9
```
The expected output should be:
```
2
1 1 1
```
However, the program will produce:
```
2
1
1
1
```
This is incorrect because the results for the second test case are not printed on a single line as required.
