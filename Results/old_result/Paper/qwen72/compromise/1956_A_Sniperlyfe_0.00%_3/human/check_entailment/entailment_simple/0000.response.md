### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the game for a given number of players `n` and a list of positions `p` to be kicked out.
   - The while loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`. This ensures that the game continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is decremented by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This correctly simulates the removal of players from the game.
   - After the loop, `n` is returned, which represents the number of players remaining in the game. This is the correct output for the function.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each initial player count.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - However, there is a logical error in the placement of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print the results after processing each `n` individually, rather than after processing all `n` values for a test case.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The core logic of `func_1` is correct and accurately simulates the game.
   - The structure of `func_2` is mostly correct, but the placement of the `print` statement is incorrect. It should be outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` to ensure that all results for a test case are printed together.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because the `print` statement in `func_2` is placed inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This causes the results to be printed prematurely, one by one, rather than all at once after processing all `n` values for a test case. The correct placement of the `print` statement should be outside the loop that processes `qs`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the results for each test case are printed together, as required by the problem statement.
