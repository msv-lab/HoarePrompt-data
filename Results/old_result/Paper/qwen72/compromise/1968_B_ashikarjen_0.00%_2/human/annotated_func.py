#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `n` times, `k` will be the number of matches found between the characters of `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` reaches `m` or the end of the loop, and `j` will be the index in `b` where the next character to be matched would start, or `m` if all characters in `b` have been checked. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of matches found between the characters of `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` reaches `m` or the end of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the number of matching characters between `a` and `b` in the order they appear, stopping when all characters in `b` have been checked or the end of `a` is reached. The function then prints the number of matches found for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the original input values remain unchanged.
