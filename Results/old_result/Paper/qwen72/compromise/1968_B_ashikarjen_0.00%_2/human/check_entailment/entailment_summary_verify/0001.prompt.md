You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases, where each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the number of matching characters between `a` and `b` in the order they appear, stopping when all characters in `b` have been checked or the end of `a` is reached. The function then prints the number of matches found for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the original input values remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in string `a` using a `for` loop.
   - For each character `a[i]` in `a`, it uses a `while` loop to find the same character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If the character is found in `b` (i.e., `b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` by 1 and moves the position `j` to the next character in `b`.
   - If the character is not found in `b` (i.e., `j` reaches the end of `b`), it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem by checking each character of `a` in order and finding its corresponding character in `b`.
- The `while` loop ensures that the function only increments `j` when the current character in `a` is found in `b`.
- The `break` statement ensures that the function stops early if it cannot find a matching character in `b` for the current character in `a`.
- The function correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Strings:** The problem description guarantees that the lengths `n` and `m` are at least 1, so there are no empty strings to handle.
- **All '0' or '1' Strings:** The function will correctly handle strings that are entirely composed of '0' or '1' by finding the longest prefix that matches.
- **No Matching Characters:** If `b` does not contain any characters from `a`, the function will correctly output 0.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
