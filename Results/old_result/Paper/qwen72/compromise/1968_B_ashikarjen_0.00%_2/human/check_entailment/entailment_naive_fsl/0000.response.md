Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` only processes a single test case and does not loop over the number of test cases `t` provided in the input. This means that if the input contains more than one test case, the program will only process the first one and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect output for the remaining test cases.

To fix this, the program should include a loop to handle each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
                j += 1
            if j < m:
                k += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        print(k)
```

This version correctly processes each of the `t` test cases.
