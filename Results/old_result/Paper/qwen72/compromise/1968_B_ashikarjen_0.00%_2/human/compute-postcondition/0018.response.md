Postcondition: ***`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `t` are specific integers provided by the user, `k` is 0 or 1, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[i]` or `j == m`. If `j < m`, `k` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `b[0]` to `b[j-2]` must all be different from `a[i]`. If `j >= m`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
