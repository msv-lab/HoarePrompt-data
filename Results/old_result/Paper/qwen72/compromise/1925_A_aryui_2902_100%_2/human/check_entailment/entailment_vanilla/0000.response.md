### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `s`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This means `s` will be of the form `abc...` repeated `n` times.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `ababc`.
   - **Subsequence Check:**
     - To check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, consider the structure of `s`.
     - The string `s` will contain each of the first `k` alphabets at least `n` times.
     - Any string of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be formed by selecting `n` characters from the repeated sequence in `s`.
     - For example, in `ababc`, the subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc` can all be found.
   - **Optimality:**
     - The length of the string `s` is `k * n`, which is the minimum length required to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences.
     - This is because each character in the first `k` alphabets must appear at least `n` times to form all possible subsequences of length `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a string `s` that satisfies the problem requirements.
   - The length of `s` is optimal, and it ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
