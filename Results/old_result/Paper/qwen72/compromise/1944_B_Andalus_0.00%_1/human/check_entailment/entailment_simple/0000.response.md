### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and then the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Sublist Creation**:
   - The function splits the list `lst` into two sublists `lft` and `rgt`, each of length `n`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good step because it helps in identifying duplicate elements easily.

4. **Duplicate and Single Element Identification**:
   - The function iterates through `lft` and `rgt` to identify duplicate elements and single elements.
   - For `lft`, it appends duplicate elements to `ldb` and single elements to `sng`.
   - For `rgt`, it only appends duplicate elements to `rdb`.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The function prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` to form the array `l` of length `2k`.
   - It then prints elements from `rdb` and `sng` to form the array `r` of length `2k`.

6. **Bitwise XOR Condition**:
   - The function ensures that the length of both `l` and `r` is `2k`.
   - However, it does not explicitly check if the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function assumes that the elements in `sng` can be used to balance the XOR condition, but it does not guarantee that the XOR condition will always be met.
   - The function does not handle the case where there are not enough duplicate elements in `ldb` or `rdb` to form arrays of length `2k`.

### Conclusion:
The function does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. It only ensures that the arrays `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and contain elements from the respective halves of the input list. Therefore, the function is not correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
