Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, and `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `T` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `n` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements from index 1 to `n-1` in the list `rgt`.
- The list `lst` remains the same as the list of integers input by the user.
- The list `lft` is still a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- The list `rgt` is still a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
- The variable `sz` is still the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`).
- The difference between `k` and `sz` is still greater than or equal to 0.
- The list `ldb` still contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
- The list `sng` still contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists).
- The variable `elem` is still the last element in `sng` that was processed.
- The list `rdb` now contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
