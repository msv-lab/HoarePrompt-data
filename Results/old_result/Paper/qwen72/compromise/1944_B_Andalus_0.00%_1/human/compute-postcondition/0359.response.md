The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function processes the list `a` and the integer `k` to determine a specific output based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It returns a value based on the processing of `a` and `k`.**
