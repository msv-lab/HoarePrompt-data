Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, `rdb`**: These variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
- **`sng`**: This list is processed by the loop, and elements are printed from it until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- **`sz`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each element printed from `sng`. The loop stops when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the last element from `sng` that was processed and printed.
- **`k - sz`**: The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `sz` will not exceed `k` unless `k` is an even number and the loop has processed enough elements to make `sz` equal to `k`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the state is such that `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed. The loop will have printed elements from `sng` until `sz` meets the condition to stop.
