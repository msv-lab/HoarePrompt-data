To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `ldb`.

1. **`elem`**: This variable will be assigned values from the list `ldb` during each iteration of the loop. We cannot adjust `elem` directly before the loop starts because it will be assigned values from `ldb` as the loop runs.
2. **`ldb`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The state of `ldb` is crucial because if it is empty, the loop will not run at all.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element
- `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`
- `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element
- `sz` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `ldb` must contain at least one element. The other variables and lists do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is 0**
