To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `elem` and `sng`.

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `T` is greater than 0
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` and `k` are input integers
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2
   - `sng` must have at least 2 elements
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in sng:
   ```

3. **Adjustments for the next iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `sng`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was the second element in `sng`.
   - For the next iteration, `elem` should be the third element in `sng`.

4. **Conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `sng` to iterate over.
   - Since `sng` must have at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements.

5. **Final State:**
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
   - `sng` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 2, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
