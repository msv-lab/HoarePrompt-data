Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to 2 and the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.***
