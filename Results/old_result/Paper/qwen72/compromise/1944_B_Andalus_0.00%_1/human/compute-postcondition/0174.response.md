Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true before the execution, otherwise `sz` remains 2, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and relationships.***
