To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `elem` and `sng`.

1. **`sng`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element.
2. **`elem`**: This variable will take the value of each element in `sng` during the loop iterations. Before the loop starts, `elem` should be the first element in `sng`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element
- `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`
- `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element
- `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2
- `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To ensure the loop executes, `sng` must have at least one element, and `elem` should be the first element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2, `sng` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`**
