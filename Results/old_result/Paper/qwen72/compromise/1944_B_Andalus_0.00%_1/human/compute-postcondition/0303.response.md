Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)`, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
