Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
