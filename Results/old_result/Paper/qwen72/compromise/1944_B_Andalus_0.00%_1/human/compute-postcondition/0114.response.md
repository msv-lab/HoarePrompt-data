The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element, and `elem` is the next element in `sng` that will be processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one more element, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `elem` is the next element in `sng` that will be processed, `sz` is incremented by 1, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**
