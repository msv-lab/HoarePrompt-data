Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `T` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `n` and `k` are input integers.
4. `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
6. `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
7. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
8. `i` is `n-1`.
9. `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
10. `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
11. `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
12. `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2.
13. `sng` must have at least 1 element.
14. `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
15. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Splitting `lst`**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.

2. **Generating `ldb` and `sng`**:
   - `ldb` contains elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sng` contains elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.

3. **Generating `rdb`**:
   - `rdb` contains elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.

4. **Calculating `sz`**:
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2.

5. **Determining `elem`**:
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet `print(elem, end=' ')` prints the value of `elem` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, which contains elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element in the list `sng`, and `sng` contains elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element)**
