Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is now `sz + 1`.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed.
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `sng`.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (because `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `sng`, the output will be the value of the third element in `sng`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
