Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus the number of elements processed from `sng`, `sng` has been processed up to the point where `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or all elements in `sng` have been processed, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `sz` will be the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus the number of elements processed from `sng`. The loop will have printed elements from `sng` until either `sz` reaches or exceeds `k` or all elements in `sng` have been processed. The last processed element from `sng` will be stored in `elem`. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, `rdb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
