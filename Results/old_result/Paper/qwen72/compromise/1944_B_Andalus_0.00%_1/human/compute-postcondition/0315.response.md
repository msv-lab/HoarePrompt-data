Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n-1`.
2. `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
3. `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2.
4. The program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces.
5. `sng` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
6. `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
7. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next part of the code.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`i` and `rdb`**: These variables are not directly relevant to the `print` statement we are analyzing.
2. **`sz`**: This variable is calculated as the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2. This value is used to determine whether the program should break out of a loop or if statement.
3. **`ldb`**: This list has had its first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements printed twice, separated by spaces. This means that some elements from `ldb` have already been printed.
4. **`sng`**: This is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
5. **`elem`**: This is the next element in the iterable `sng`.

### What Will Be Printed:
- The `print` statement will print the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the iterable sng)**

This output is the most precise description based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
