Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or `sz` is the total number of elements processed from `sng` (up to the point where `k - sz < 2`), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, and the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code snippet `rdb = []` reassigns `rdb` to an empty list, overriding any previous value it might have had. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
