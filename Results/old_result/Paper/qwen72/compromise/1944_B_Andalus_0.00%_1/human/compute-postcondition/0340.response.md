Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least `k // 2` elements. `sz` is `k` or the number of elements printed is the maximum possible without exceeding `k`. The program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` remains at `n-1`, and `rdb` still contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index. The loop will have processed at least `k // 2` elements from `rdb`, and `sz` will be equal to `k` or the maximum number of elements that could be printed without exceeding `k`. The program will have printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted. If `sz` reaches `k` at any point, the loop will terminate.
