To determine what will be printed by the `print()` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `rgt`.
   - `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
   - The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `rdb` is a list that contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `ldb` is another list, but its exact content is not specified in the initial state.
   - `sng` is a list, but its exact content is also not specified.
   - `k` is an integer that determines the total number of elements to be printed.
   - `sz` is the total number of elements that have been printed so far.

3. **What the `print()` Statement Does:**
   - The `print()` statement without any arguments will print a newline character, which is essentially an empty line.

Given the initial state and the context, the `print()` statement will simply print a newline character, as it does not contain any arguments to print specific values.

Output: **(an empty line)**
