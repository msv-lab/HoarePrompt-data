Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 1, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` remains an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` and the element at index `i` of `lft`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` remains an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, otherwise `sng` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 3, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains the element `lft[3]`, and `sng` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ldb` remains an empty list, and `sng` is a list containing the fourth element of `lft` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
