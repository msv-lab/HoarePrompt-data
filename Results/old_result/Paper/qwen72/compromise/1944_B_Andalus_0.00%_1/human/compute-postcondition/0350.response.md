Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- If `sz` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state) is greater than or equal to `k` (also not explicitly defined), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `sng` or `elem`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`sng` List**: Since `sng` must have at least one element, it could be a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, `[a, b, c]`, etc.
2. **`elem` Variable**: `elem` is described as the "next element" in `sng`. This implies that `elem` is the element that follows the current element being processed in `sng`. However, without knowing the current element or the index, we can only say that `elem` is the next element in the list.
3. **`sz` and `k` Conditions**: The conditions involving `sz` and `k` are not directly relevant to the `print` statement itself, but they influence whether the `print` statement is executed. If `sz` is less than `k`, the `print` statement will execute, and `elem` will be printed.

### Output Determination:
Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and the `print` statement is executed, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`)**
