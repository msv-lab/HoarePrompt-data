Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 0, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed, and `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and relationships.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true before the execution, otherwise `sz` remains 2, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and relationships.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 6 if `k - sz >= 2` was true before the execution, otherwise `sz` is 4, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `ldb` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if the next element exists), `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and relationships.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
