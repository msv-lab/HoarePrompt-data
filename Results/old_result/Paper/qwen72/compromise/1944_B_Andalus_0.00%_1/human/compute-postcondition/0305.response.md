To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the last index of the `rgt` list.
   - `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)`.
   - The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces.
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement is inside a loop or conditional block.
   - The variable `elem` is being printed, and the `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the print statement:

- The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice.
- The `sz` variable is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.

Since the program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, the total number of elements printed so far is `2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))`.

- If `k` is even, `2 * (k // 2) = k`, so `sz` will be `k`.
- If `k` is odd, `2 * (k // 2) = k - 1`, so `sz` will be `k - 1`.

In both cases, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will break out of the loop.

Now, let's consider the `elem` variable:
- `elem` is an element from the `sng` iterable.
- Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable, the `elem` will be the next element in the iteration of `sng`.

Given that the program has already printed the required number of elements from `ldb`, the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the next element from `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element from the `sng` iterable)**
