Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the third element of `lft` and `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`, and `ldb` remains an empty list. Otherwise, both `ldb` and `sng` remain empty lists. `rdb` remains an empty list.***
