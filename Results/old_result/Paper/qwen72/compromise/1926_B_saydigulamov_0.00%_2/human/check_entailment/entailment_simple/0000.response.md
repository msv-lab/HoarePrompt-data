### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then the grid itself, storing the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' in the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**:
   - The function checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints `k`.
   - However, the problem requires the function to print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle. The current implementation only prints the list `k` and does not determine the shape correctly.

3. **Shape Conditions**:
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of consecutive '1's.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a sequence where the i-th row has 2*i-1 '1's (or the reverse for an upside-down triangle).

4. **Missing Logic**:
   - The function lacks the logic to check if the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - It should check if all elements in `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square.
   - It should check if the elements in `k` form a sequence of 2*i-1 or the reverse to determine if the shape is a triangle.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly determine and print the shape as required by the problem statement. It only prints the list `k` and does not perform the necessary checks to identify the shape.
