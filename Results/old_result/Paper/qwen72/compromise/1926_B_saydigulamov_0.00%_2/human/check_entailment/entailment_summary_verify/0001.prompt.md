You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1's in each line that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, it prints the list `k`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - After collecting the counts, it checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints the list `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program should print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
   - However, the program prints the list `k` instead of the required output.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is insufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal, and for a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains an upside-down triangle correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains a rotated triangle (which is not allowed but should be considered invalid).

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
     - Check if all elements in `k` are equal to determine if it's a square.
     - Check if the elements in `k` form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one to determine if it's a triangle.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
