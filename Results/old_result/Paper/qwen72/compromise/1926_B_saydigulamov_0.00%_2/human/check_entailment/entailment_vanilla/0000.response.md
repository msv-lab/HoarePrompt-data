Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - After collecting the counts, it checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints the list `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program should print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
   - However, the program prints the list `k` instead of the required output.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - The program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is insufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal, and for a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains an upside-down triangle correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid contains a rotated triangle (which is not allowed but should be considered invalid).

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
     - Check if all elements in `k` are equal to determine if it's a square.
     - Check if the elements in `k` form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one to determine if it's a triangle.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
