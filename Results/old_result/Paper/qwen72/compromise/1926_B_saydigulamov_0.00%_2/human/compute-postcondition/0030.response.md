Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` contains the number of '1' characters in `b` plus one additional count of '1' characters in `b`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains an empty list. `b` is the input string provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.***
