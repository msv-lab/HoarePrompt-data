Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` where `b` contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings `b` that contained '1' characters.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains 2 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: The list `k` will contain the count of '1' characters for each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. If an input string `b` does not contain '1', nothing is appended to `k` for that iteration. Therefore, the length of `k` will be equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'.
