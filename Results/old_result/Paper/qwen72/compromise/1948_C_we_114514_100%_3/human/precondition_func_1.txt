No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it reads from standard input. The first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even) followed by two strings of length n, row1 and row2, each containing only the characters '<' and '>'.
