The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `results` being an empty list and the values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remaining unchanged do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged**
