The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a space-separated string of 2n integers. It then processes these integers in pairs, summing the minimum value of each pair, and appends the result to a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`, which contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs for each test case. The function does not return any value.
