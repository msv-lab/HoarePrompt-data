Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements:**
   - The line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The multiplication by 2 is unnecessary and will cause the program to remove elements that are not the first two elements of the list.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements would be `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the list has exactly two elements correctly. The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` should be `if len(lst) > 2:` to ensure that the loop continues until only two elements are left.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program does not follow the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. The optimal strategy is to sort the list and then always pick the smallest two elements to maximize the sum of the minimum values. The current implementation does not sort the list, which can lead to suboptimal results.

**Example Case:**
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  2
  1 3 2 4
  ```
  The program will output:
  ```
  3
  ```
  However, the correct output should be:
  ```
  4
  ```
  The optimal way to achieve the maximum score is to first pick 1 and 2 (score += 1), then pick 3 and 4 (score += 3), resulting in a total score of 4. The program does not sort the list, so it picks 1 and 3 (score += 1), then 2 and 4 (score += 2), resulting in a total score of 3, which is incorrect.
