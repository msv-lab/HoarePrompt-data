Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` (which was 0) and the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**

In simpler terms:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `t` remains greater than `n * 2 + 1`.
- `ans_f` remains a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element).
- `l` remains the new input string.
- `lst` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.
- `ans` is now the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers.
- The length of `lst` remains exactly 2.
