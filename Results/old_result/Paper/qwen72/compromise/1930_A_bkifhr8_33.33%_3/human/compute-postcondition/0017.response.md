Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the minimum value between the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`.
- The first and second elements of `lst` are removed, so `lst` now contains the remaining elements.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
