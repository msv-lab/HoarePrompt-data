Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the two substrings in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first, second, and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[2])` before the third element was removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed. In the latter case, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` added to the previous value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the first and second elements of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
