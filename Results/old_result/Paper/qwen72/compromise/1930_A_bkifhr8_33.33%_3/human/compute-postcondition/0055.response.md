The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` converted to integers.**
