Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first and second elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first, second, and third elements of `lst` have been removed, and `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[2])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. In the latter case, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
