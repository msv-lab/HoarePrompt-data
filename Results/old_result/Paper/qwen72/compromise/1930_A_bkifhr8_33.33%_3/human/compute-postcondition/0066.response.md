Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, `ans` is 0.**

The code `lst = l.split(' ')` updates the variable `lst` to be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `l` using spaces as the delimiter. All other variables remain unchanged.
