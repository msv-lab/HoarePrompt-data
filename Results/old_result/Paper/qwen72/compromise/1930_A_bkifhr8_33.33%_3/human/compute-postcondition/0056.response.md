The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than `n * 2`
- `i` is 2
- `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`
- `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0
- `l` is the new input string
- `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but with the first element removed
- `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` converted to integers

Impact of the code:
- The element at index 2 of `lst` is removed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but with the first and third elements removed, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first and second elements of the original `lst` converted to integers.**
