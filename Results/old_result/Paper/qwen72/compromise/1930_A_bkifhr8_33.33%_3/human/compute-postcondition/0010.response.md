Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not 2. The first element of `lst` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is not 2.
- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[0])`, which removes the first element of `lst`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The length of `lst` is now one less than it was before, but it still does not equal 2.
