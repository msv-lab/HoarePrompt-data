The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `ops` that stores tuples of integers representing operations. It ensures that for the subarray `a[l:r+1]`, if any element is not equal to `r - l + 1`, all elements in this subarray are set to `r - l + 1`, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to `ops`. If the subarray is already filled with `r - l + 1`, no modifications are made. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` may have some elements modified to `r - l + 1` within the specified range, and the list `ops` may contain new tuples representing these modifications.
