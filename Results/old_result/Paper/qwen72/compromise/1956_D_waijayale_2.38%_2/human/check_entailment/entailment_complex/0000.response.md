Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum and to output the sequence of operations that leads to this sum.

### Analysis of the Functions:

1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops):**
   - This function modifies a subarray `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` if any element is not already equal to `r - l + 1`.
   - It appends the operation `(l, r)` to the `ops` list.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0 and sets it to 0 if necessary, appending the operation `(l, l)` to `ops`.

2. **func_2(a):**
   - This function initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to process the entire array.
   - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, there is a critical issue: the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the wrong arguments. It should be `recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1)` instead of just `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):**
   - This function recursively processes the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It computes the sum `s` of the subarray and compares it to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - If `s` is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.

4. **func_3():**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results.
   - It correctly prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations in the required format.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`:** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` instead of `recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1)`. This is a significant error because `recursive_maximize_sum` needs the array `a` to operate on it. Without passing `a`, the function will not have access to the array and will not be able to perform the necessary operations.

### Conclusion:

Given the critical error in `func_2` where the array `a` is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program will not function correctly and will not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements.

Correctness: **False**
