Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to call `recursive_maximize_sum` with the correct parameters, but it does not pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum`. This means that `recursive_maximize_sum` will not have access to the `ops` list to append operations to it, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined but not called with the correct parameters. It should be called with `l`, `r`, and `ops` as arguments, but it is only called with `l` and `r`.
   - The function also contains a logical error in the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This condition is not correctly checking if the current segment can be maximized by setting all elements to the MEX value. The correct approach would be to compute the MEX value and then check if it can be used to maximize the sum.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the case where the segment can be maximized by setting all elements to the MEX value, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value. Instead, it sets the elements to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX value.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` reads the input and calls `func_2`, but it does not correctly handle the output format. The output should be the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves, but the function only prints the sum and the number of operations.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Compute the MEX value for the segment.
- Use the MEX value to update the segment if it can increase the sum.
- Ensure that the operations are correctly recorded and printed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def compute_mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex = 0
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    mex = compute_mex(a[l:r + 1])
    if mex > 0:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    func_1(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage:
# func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX value is correctly computed and used to update the array, and it correctly records and prints the operations.
