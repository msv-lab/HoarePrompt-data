You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `ops` that stores tuples of integers representing operations.

If `s` > `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `s` is the sum of the integers from `a[l]` to `a[r]` inclusive, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the list `a` starting from `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, the function retains all the initial conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two non-negative integers `l` and `r`, and a list `a` of integers. It modifies the list `a` such that within the range `[l, r]`, if the sum of the elements in this range is less than or equal to the square of the range length, all elements in this range are set to the range length, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, the function recursively processes the subranges to the left and right of the maximum element in the range `[l, r]`. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the list `a` and the list `ops` reflects the changes made according to the conditions described.

    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The loop iterates through each pair `(l, r)` in `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. The function prints `s` and `m`, and then iterates over each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`, printing `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair. After the function concludes, the values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the pairs in `ops` have been printed in a modified form.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. Specifically, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined but not used correctly. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Additionally, the condition in `func_1` where it checks `if a[l] != r - l + 1` is not always correct. The MEX operation should be applied to the range `[l, r]` to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, but the code directly sets `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` without computing the MEX.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 0
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  10 1
  1 4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will likely raise a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

To fix this, the `ops` list should be passed correctly to `recursive_maximize_sum`, and the MEX computation should be implemented correctly.
