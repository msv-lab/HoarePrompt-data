Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < len(`a`), `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= `a[i]` <= 10^7, `s` is the sum of the integers from `a[l]` to `a[r]` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the list `a` starting from `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
