The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers, and a list `a` of integers. The parameters `l` and `r` must satisfy the constraints 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and each element in the list `a` must be an integer in the range 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters and the list `a`. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. Assuming the function is designed to maximize a sum within the range `[l, r]` of the list `a`, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers `l` and `r`, and a list `a` of integers. It returns the maximum sum that can be achieved within the range `[l, r]` of the list `a`.**
