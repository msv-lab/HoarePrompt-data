The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. The function prints `s` and `m`, and then iterates over each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`, printing `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair. After the function concludes, the values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the pairs in `ops` have been printed in a modified form.
