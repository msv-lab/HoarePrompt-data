Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an n x m grid represented as a list of strings, where each string consists of characters 'W' and 'B' indicating the colors of the grid's squares. The values of n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
