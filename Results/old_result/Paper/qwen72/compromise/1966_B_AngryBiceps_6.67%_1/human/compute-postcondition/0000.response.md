The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin.
- Each test case includes an n x m grid represented as a list of strings.
- The values of n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500.
- The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input for the number of test cases (t) is greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
