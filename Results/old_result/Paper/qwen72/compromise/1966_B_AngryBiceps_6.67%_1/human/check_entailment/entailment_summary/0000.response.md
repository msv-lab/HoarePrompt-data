Reasoning:  
The program `func` is designed to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operations. The logic of the program is based on a key observation: if the first and last rows or the first and last columns of the grid have different colors, then it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle will always preserve the color of the boundary squares, and thus, if the boundary squares (first and last rows or columns) have different colors, no operation can make them the same.

However, the program has a flaw in its logic. It only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, but it does not consider the entire grid. Specifically, the program:

1. Collects the first and last characters of each row to form `first_row` and `last_row`.
2. Checks if the first row contains only one unique color and if this color is different from the last row.
3. Checks if the first column (formed by the first characters of each row) contains only one unique color and if this color is different from the last column (formed by the last characters of each row).

This logic is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that the grid might have a checkerboard pattern or other configurations where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but the rest of the grid is not uniform.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the entire grid can be made uniform by ensuring that there are no "isolated" squares of a different color that cannot be changed. A more robust approach would be to check if the grid can be divided into two regions of the same color, which can then be made uniform by operations.

Given the provided program, it will fail for certain test cases where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but the grid cannot be made uniform. For example, a grid like this:

```
2 2
WB
BW
```

The program will incorrectly output "YES" because the first and last rows are the same, but it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
