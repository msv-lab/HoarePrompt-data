### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and then reads the grid itself into a list of strings `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
     - `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each row.
     - `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each row.
   - The function then checks two conditions:
     - If the first row of the grid contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last row, it prints 'NO'.
     - If the first column of the grid (represented by `first_row`) contains only one unique color and that color is different from the last column (represented by `last_row`), it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The first condition checks if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row. This is a valid check because if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid one color using the given operations.
   - The second condition checks if the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column. This is also a valid check for the same reason as the first condition.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it is possible to make the entire grid one color. This is because the operations allow us to select any two squares of the same color and color the subrectangle between them, which can eventually lead to the entire grid being one color if there are no such conflicting rows or columns.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the grid is a single row or a single column correctly.
   - For a 1x1 grid, both conditions will be false, and the function will print 'YES', which is correct.
   - For a grid where all squares are already the same color, the function will print 'YES', which is correct.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the function is sound and aligns with the problem description. It correctly identifies when it is impossible to make the entire grid one color and when it is possible.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations, based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
