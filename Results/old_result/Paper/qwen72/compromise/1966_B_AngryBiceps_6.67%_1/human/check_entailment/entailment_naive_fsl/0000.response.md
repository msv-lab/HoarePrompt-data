Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire grid.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
In this grid, the first and last rows are the same (`W B W`), and the first and last columns are also the same (`W B W`). According to the program, it would print "YES" because the first and last rows and columns are consistent. However, it is impossible to make all squares in this grid the same color using the allowed operations.

### Why the Program Fails:
The program fails to consider the internal structure of the grid. For a grid to be completely filled with the same color, it must be possible to select two squares of the same color and fill the subrectangle between them. The program's logic only checks the boundary conditions, which are not sufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid the same color.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if there is at least one row or one column that is entirely the same color. If there is, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting the appropriate subrectangles. If no such row or column exists, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
