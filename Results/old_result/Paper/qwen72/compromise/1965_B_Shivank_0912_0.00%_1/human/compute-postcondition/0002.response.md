The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `k`, and the list `cases`. For the loop to execute, the list `cases` must contain at least one tuple, and the variables `n` and `k` must be set to the values of the first tuple in `cases`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
- `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n)
- `results` is an empty list
- `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index

The loop will execute if `cases` is not empty. For the first iteration, `n` and `k` must be set to the values of the first tuple in `cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `cases`, `k` is the second element of the first tuple in `cases`**
