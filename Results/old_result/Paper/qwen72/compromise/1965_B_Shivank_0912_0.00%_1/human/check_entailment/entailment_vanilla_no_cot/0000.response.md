Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the sequence generated by the function `func_1` is a fixed sequence of powers of 2, which is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...]`. This sequence has the property that any sum of its subsequences is unique and can be any number that is a sum of distinct powers of 2. However, this sequence does not necessarily meet the conditions of the problem for all values of `n` and `k`.

For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` will have a subsequence that sums to 1 (the subsequence `[1]`), which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.

Additionally, the sequence generated is always of size 25, which is not necessary and may not be the most efficient solution for smaller values of `n`.

To solve the problem correctly, the sequence should be constructed in such a way that it avoids any subsequence summing to `k` while ensuring that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. A more appropriate approach would involve carefully selecting elements to ensure the conditions are met.
