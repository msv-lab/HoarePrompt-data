The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(25, sequence)`. The `sequence` list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `cases`.
