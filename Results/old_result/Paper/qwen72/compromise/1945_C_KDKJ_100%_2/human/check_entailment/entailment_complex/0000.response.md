### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the standard input. These inputs represent the number of houses and the preferences of the residents, respectively.
   - **Cumulative Count Calculation:** The function constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's (left-side preferences) and '1's (right-side preferences) up to that point in the string `a`.
   - **Condition Checking:** The function iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to `n`). For each position, it checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides meets the condition (at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied).
   - **Optimal Position Selection:** If the condition is met, the function updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village.
   - **Output:** The function prints the optimal position `ans`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Test Case Handling:** The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - **Function Calls:** For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine the optimal road position.
   - **Output:** The function does not return any value but prints the results of each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
- The condition checks ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The function correctly updates the answer to the position that is closest to the middle of the village.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case:** The function should work correctly for a single test case.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The function should handle the cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house.

### Example Verification:
- For the input `3` and `101`, the function correctly outputs `2`.
- For the input `6` and `010111`, the function correctly outputs `3`.
- For the input `6` and `011001`, the function correctly outputs `2`.
- For the input `3` and `000`, the function correctly outputs `3`.
- For the input `3` and `110`, the function correctly outputs `0`.
- For the input `3` and `001`, the function correctly outputs `1`.
- For the input `4` and `1100`, the function correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem as specified.
