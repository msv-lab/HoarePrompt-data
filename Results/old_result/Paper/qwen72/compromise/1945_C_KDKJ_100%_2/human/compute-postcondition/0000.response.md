The loop head involves the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. 

Since the state before the loop starts indicates that none of the variables are passed to the function `func_2()`, and the loop's execution depends on the input, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
