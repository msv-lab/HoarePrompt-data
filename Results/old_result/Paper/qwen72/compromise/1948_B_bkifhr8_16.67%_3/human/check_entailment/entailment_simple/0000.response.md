### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `list1` itself.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting any element in `list1` that is greater than 10 and reinserting its digits.
   - The operation is performed in a loop that iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If an element `list1[p - 1]` is greater than the next element `list1[p]` and is greater than 10, it is split into its digits and reinserted into the array.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After the operation simulation, the program checks if the array `list1` is sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` compares the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating that the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted and 'No' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Operation Simulation:**
  - The operation is only performed once per test case, but the problem description allows for the operation to be performed any number of times.
  - The program should continue performing the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

- **Early Termination:**
  - The program does not handle the case where the array might become sorted after multiple operations. It only checks the array once after a single pass through the loop.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the possibility of performing the operation multiple times to achieve a sorted array.
  - For example, in the test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted, which it is not. However, if the operation is performed multiple times, the array can be sorted as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
