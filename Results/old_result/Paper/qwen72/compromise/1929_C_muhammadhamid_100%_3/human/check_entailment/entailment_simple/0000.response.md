Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` after a series of bets, given the constraints on the casino's rules and the initial number of coins `a`.

The key insight is to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from a series of up to `x` consecutive losses and still have a chance to win more coins. This is because if Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses, he can continue betting and eventually reach any number of coins `n`.

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 1. This represents the smallest amount of coins Sasha can start with to test if he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins Needed**:
   - The inner loop runs `x` times, simulating the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated to `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - `s // (k - 1)` represents the minimum bet amount Sasha needs to make to recover from the previous loss.
     - Adding 1 ensures that Sasha can always place a bet, even if the division result is 0 (which would not be a valid bet amount).

3. **Comparison**:
   - After the loop, `s` contains the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The program checks if `a` (the initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes" (indicating Sasha can achieve his goal).
   - Otherwise, it prints "No" (indicating Sasha cannot achieve his goal).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `a` is 1 and `x` is 1 (i.e., the second test case in the example). In this case, Sasha cannot recover from a single loss, so the output is "No".
   - The program also handles larger values of `a` and `x` correctly by calculating the minimum required coins and comparing them to `a`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as it only involves a few arithmetic operations and a loop running up to 100 times (the maximum value of `x`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
