The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `x` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `x` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 0, `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + (1 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 2**
