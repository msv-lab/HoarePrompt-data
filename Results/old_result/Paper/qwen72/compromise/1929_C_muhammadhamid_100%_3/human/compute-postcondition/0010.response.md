Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `s` is the value of `s` after `x` iterations of the loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration.
   - `i` is `x - 1`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `x` times.
   - In each iteration, `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Initially, `s` is 0.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Let's analyze the loop step by step:
     - **Iteration 1:**
       - `s` is 0.
       - `s` is incremented by `0 // (k - 1) + 1` which is `1`.
       - After the first iteration, `s` is 1.
     - **Iteration 2:**
       - `s` is 1.
       - `s` is incremented by `1 // (k - 1) + 1` which is `1` (since `1 // (k - 1)` is 0 for \(k \geq 2\)).
       - After the second iteration, `s` is 2.
     - **Iteration 3:**
       - `s` is 2.
       - `s` is incremented by `2 // (k - 1) + 1` which is `1` (since `2 // (k - 1)` is 0 for \(k \geq 3\)).
       - After the third iteration, `s` is 3.
     - **General Pattern:**
       - For \(k \geq 3\), `s` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration because `s // (k - 1)` will be 0 for the first few iterations.
       - For \(k = 2\), `s` will be incremented by `s // 1 + 1` which is `s + 1` in each iteration.

4. **Final Value of `s`:**
   - For \(k \geq 3\), `s` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so after `x` iterations, `s` will be `x`.
   - For \(k = 2\), `s` will be incremented by `s + 1` in each iteration, which means `s` will grow exponentially. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `k`, we will consider the general case where \(k \geq 3\).

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - Since `s` is `x` after `x` iterations, the condition becomes `a >= x`.

6. **Output Determination:**
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, the output will be 'Yes'.
   - If `a` is less than `x`, the output will be 'No'.

Given the initial state and the loop execution, the final value of `s` is `x`. Therefore, the `print` statement will output 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, and 'No' otherwise.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= x else 'No' (where a is the value of a and x is the number of iterations)**
