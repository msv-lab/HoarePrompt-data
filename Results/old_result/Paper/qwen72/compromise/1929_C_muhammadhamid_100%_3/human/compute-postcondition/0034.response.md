The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, where each test case involves three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The constraints are as follows: `1 <= t <= 1000` for the number of test cases, `2 <= k <= 30` for `k`, `1 <= x <= 100` for `x`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9` for `a`.

The function returns different values based on the relationships between these parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within specified ranges. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific return values based on the relationships between `k`, `x`, and `a` are not provided in the output description.**
