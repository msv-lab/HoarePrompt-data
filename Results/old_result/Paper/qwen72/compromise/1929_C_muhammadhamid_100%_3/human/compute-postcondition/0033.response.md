Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is `t - 1`, `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 1` for each test case, `i` is `x - 1` for the last test case.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, representing the total number of test cases.
- For each test case, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
- The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1` after all iterations, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `s` will have been computed for each test case by the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x` times, starting from `s = 1`.
- The inner loop counter `i` will be `x - 1` for the last test case, as it completes the final iteration of the inner loop.
