Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an integer input.
   - `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an integer input.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 1`.
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than `x`.

2. **Understanding the Expression for `s`:**
   - The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is executed `x` times starting from `s = 1`.
   - This means that `s` is updated `x` times using the given formula.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - Let's denote the initial value of `s` as \( s_0 = 1 \).
   - After the first iteration, \( s_1 = s_0 + s_0 // (k - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 \).
     - If \( k = 2 \), then \( s_1 = 1 + 1 // 1 + 1 = 3 \).
     - If \( k > 2 \), then \( s_1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \).
   - After the second iteration, \( s_2 = s_1 + s_1 // (k - 1) + 1 \).
     - If \( k = 2 \), then \( s_2 = 3 + 3 // 1 + 1 = 7 \).
     - If \( k > 2 \), then \( s_2 = 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 \).
       - If \( k = 3 \), then \( s_2 = 2 + 2 // 2 + 1 = 4 \).
       - If \( k > 3 \), then \( s_2 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \).
   - This process continues for `x` iterations.

4. **Final Value of `s`:**
   - The exact value of `s` after `x` iterations depends on the value of `k`.
   - However, we can say that `s` will be a positive integer that is the result of the given formula executed `x` times starting from 1.

5. **Condition in the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If `a < s`, it prints 'No'.

6. **Input Constraints:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than `x`.
   - This means that the value of `a` must be greater than `x`.

7. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `a` must be greater than `x`, and `s` is calculated based on `x` and `k`, the value of `s` will be a positive integer that is at most `x` times the result of the formula.
   - Given that `a` is greater than `x`, and `s` is derived from `x` and `k`, it is highly likely that `a` will be greater than or equal to `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **Yes (where `a` is greater than `x` and `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 1`)**
