The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations specified by the user. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and the loop has already run `x` times, where `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` must be greater than `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 1, `s` is the value of `s` after `x` iterations of the loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration, `i` is `x - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**
