You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `n` and `m` are updated for each iteration based on the input, and the loop completes after `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and the program returns to its caller.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 100 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 1 \le n, m \le 100 \) (number of moves and target number of cubes)

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( n \) is the number of moves and \( m \) is the target number of cubes, the difference \( n - m \) must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the total number of moves is even.
   - Additionally, \( n \) must be at least as large as \( m \) because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if you start from 0 cubes.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \ge m \) and if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Verification**:
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach \( m \) cubes.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the balance of additions and removals.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 3 \): \( n \ge m \) and \( (3 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \), so the output is 'YES'.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \): \( n < m \), so the output is 'NO'.
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \): \( n \ge m \) and \( (5 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \), so the output is 'YES'.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly solves the problem as described.
