The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and is expected to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, we can adjust the state to ensure that `t` is within this range and that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0**
