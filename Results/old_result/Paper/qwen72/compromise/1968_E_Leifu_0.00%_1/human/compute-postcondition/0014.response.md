Based on the initial state provided:
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down what this statement does:
1. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string. Since `j` is 6, `str(j)` will be `'6'`.
2. `' '` is a string containing a single space.
3. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. Therefore, `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will concatenate `'6'`, `' '`, and `'6'` to form the string `'6 6'`.

Thus, the `print` statement will output:
Output: **6 6**
