The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'2 4'`.
- The initial state provides information about variables `n`, `t`, `i`, and the condition that `n` is not equal to 3. However, these variables and conditions do not affect the `print` statement because the `print` statement is printing a fixed string and not any of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'2 4'`.
Output: **2 4**
