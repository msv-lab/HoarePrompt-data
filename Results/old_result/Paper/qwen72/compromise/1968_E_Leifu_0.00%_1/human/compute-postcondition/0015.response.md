Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 4` to `j = n`, inclusive.
- After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` by 1 each time and stops when `j` exceeds `n`.
- The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
