To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable will be set by the loop itself, starting from 4 and iterating up to `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 4, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not involved in the loop head, it is mentioned as a condition).
- `i` is 1 (again, not involved in the loop head).
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1` (this is a condition that affects `j` but is not relevant to the loop head).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is greater than or equal to 4. The variable `j` will be set by the loop itself, starting from 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
