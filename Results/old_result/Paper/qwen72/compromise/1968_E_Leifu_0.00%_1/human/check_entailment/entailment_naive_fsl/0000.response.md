Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program outputs a fixed pattern of points that does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 4\). The program outputs the following points:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```
However, this does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The set of Manhattan distances for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-2|, |1-2| + |1-4|, |1-3| + |1-3|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-2| + |1-2|, |2-3| + |4-3|, |2-4| + |4-4|, |3-4| + |3-4| \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 1, 4, 4, 6, 1, 2, 2, 2 \} = \{ 1, 2, 4, 6 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, but it is possible to achieve a larger set of distinct distances. For instance, the points:
```
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```
Would yield:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-4|, |1-4| + |1-1|, |1-4| + |1-4|, |1-1| + |4-4|, |1-4| + |4-1|, |4-4| + |1-4| \}
\]
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 3, 3, 6, 0, 6, 3 \} = \{ 0, 3, 6 \}
\]
The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3, which is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\). The maximum size for \(n = 4\) is 6, which can be achieved by a different arrangement of points.

Thus, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\), and therefore, it is incorrect.
