Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In this case, the return statement is provided without any value or variable, which means the function ends without returning any specific output. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated based on the execution of `func_2()` and `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_3(l)` is executed, but since the return statement is empty, no value or variable is returned.
