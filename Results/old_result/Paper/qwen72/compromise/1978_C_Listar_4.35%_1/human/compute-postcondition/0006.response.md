Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the specific values returned by `func_2()`, `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_3(l)` has been executed.** 

The values of `n` and `k` still adhere to the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0. The specific values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, but `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_3(l)` has been called with `l` as its argument, and its effects are not specified, so we assume it does not change the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`.
