The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `n` and `k` after they have been updated by the function `func_2()`, but it does not influence the `print` statement in any way. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Given that the `print` statement is simply printing a constant string, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **NO**
