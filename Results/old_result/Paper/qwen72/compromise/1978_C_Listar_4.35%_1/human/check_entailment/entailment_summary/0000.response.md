### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs some initial checks.
   - If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no permutation can have an odd Manhattan value.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`. The formula used is correct: for an odd `n`, the maximum value is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for an even `n`, the maximum value is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no permutation can achieve a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - If `k` is even and within the valid range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for generating a permutation with a specific Manhattan value.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates from the last element to the first, moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`.
   - The logic is to reduce `k` by the largest possible value in each step, ensuring that the final permutation has the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, it returns the modified list.
   - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it continues to move the last element to the beginning of the list until `k` is zero.
   - This function should correctly generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value, provided `k` is even and within the valid range.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints the result of the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It ensures the output format is correct as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the overall process.
   - It calls `func_2` to validate the input and get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic in `func_2` ensures that only valid permutations (with even `k` and within the maximum possible Manhattan value) are processed.
- The logic in `func_1` is designed to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value, and it should work correctly for valid inputs.
- The output format in `func_3` matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly handles the constraints and generates the required permutations.

### Correctness:
