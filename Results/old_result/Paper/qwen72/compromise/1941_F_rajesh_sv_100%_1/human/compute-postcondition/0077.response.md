Output State: **`l` is `h - 1`, `h` is `mid`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is `h - 1 + (h - (h - 1)) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**

Explanation:
- `h` is updated to the value of `mid`.
- `mid` is calculated as `h - 1 + (h - (h - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `h - 1 + 1 // 2` and further to `h - 1 + 0`, so `mid` is `h - 1`.
- Therefore, `h` is now `h - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
- `f` is still the next element in `F`.
- `mid_sum` is still `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is still `D[mid + 1] + f`.
