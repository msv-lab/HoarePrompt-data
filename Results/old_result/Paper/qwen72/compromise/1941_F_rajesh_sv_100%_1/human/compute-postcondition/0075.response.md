Output State: **`l` is `h - 1`, `h` remains unchanged, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is `h - 1 + (h - (h - 1)) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- `mid` is calculated as `h - 1 + (h - (h - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `h - 1 + 1 // 2`, and since `1 // 2` is 0, `mid` is `h - 1`.
- Therefore, `mid_sum` is `D[h - 1] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[h] + f`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
