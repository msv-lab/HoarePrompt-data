Output State: **The loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`. `l` is now the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`.**

Explanation:
- The `bisect_right` function is used to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`.
- The value of `l` is updated to this insertion point.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
- The loop condition (`l` equal to `h`) is still valid, and `f` is still the next element in `F`.
