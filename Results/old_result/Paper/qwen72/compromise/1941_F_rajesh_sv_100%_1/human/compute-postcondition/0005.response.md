The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been called twice. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `testcases` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called twice.**
