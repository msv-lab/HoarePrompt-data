Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are now the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is 1 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to the previous `max_diff`, and `index` is 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, and `index` is 1 if `diff` > `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to the previous `max_diff`, and `index` is 3. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is 2. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `max_diff` remains the same, `next_max_diff` remains the same, and `index` is None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
