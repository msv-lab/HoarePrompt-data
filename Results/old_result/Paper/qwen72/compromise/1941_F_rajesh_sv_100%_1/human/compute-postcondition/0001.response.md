The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration, and it does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, `testcases` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be assigned by the loop itself.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
