Output State: **The loop terminates with `l` equal to `h`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`. `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- `bisect_left(D, right - f)` finds the index in the sorted list `D` where `right - f` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
- `h` is then set to this index minus 1.
- All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
