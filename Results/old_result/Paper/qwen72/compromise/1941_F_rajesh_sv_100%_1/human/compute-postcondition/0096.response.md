Output State: **`f` is the next element in `F`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index just before the first value in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f` and `h` must be greater than `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and all other values (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than the current value of `right - mid_next_sum`.**
