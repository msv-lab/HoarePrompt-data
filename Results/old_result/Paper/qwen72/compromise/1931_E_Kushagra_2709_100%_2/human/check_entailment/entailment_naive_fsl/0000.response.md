Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players, but it does not accurately simulate the game as described. The function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the largest numbers, but this does not reflect the actual game rules where Anna reverses the digits of a single number and Sasha concatenates two numbers.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Sasha
```

Actual Output:
```
Anna
```

The program incorrectly returns "Anna" because it does not correctly simulate the game. According to the game rules, Anna can reverse the number 14 to 41, and then Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to form 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\), so Sasha should win. However, the program does not follow this logic and returns "Anna" instead.
