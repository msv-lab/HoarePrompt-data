The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `frequency_table` is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, the loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
