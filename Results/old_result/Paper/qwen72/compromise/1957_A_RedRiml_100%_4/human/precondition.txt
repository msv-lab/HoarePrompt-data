t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, test_cases is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
