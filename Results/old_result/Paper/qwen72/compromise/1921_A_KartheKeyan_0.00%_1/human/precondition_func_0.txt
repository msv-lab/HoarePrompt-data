The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method (e.g., standard input) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) are within the range \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\). The number of test cases \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\). It is guaranteed that the given points form a valid square with a positive area.
