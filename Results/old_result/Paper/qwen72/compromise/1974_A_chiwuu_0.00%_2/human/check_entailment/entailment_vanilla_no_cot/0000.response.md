Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains some logical errors that lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `b * 2` by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid is 5x3 (15 cells per screen). The correct calculation should be based on the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons, which is `b * 4`, and then dividing by 15 to find the number of screens needed for these icons.

2. **Calculation of remaining cells for 1x1 icons:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct, but the subsequent logic to determine if additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons is flawed.
   - The program then calculates `t2` as `a - t1`, which is the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit into the remaining cells. However, the way it adds additional screens is incorrect. It should check if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the current screens before adding new ones.

3. **Handling of edge cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where no icons are present (i.e., `a = 0` and `b = 0`) correctly. It should output 0 in such cases, but the current logic might not do so.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Screens for 2x2 icons:**
   - `screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` ensures that we round up the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to divide the total number of cells required by 15 (the number of cells per screen).

2. **Remaining cells for 1x1 icons:**
   - `remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4` calculates the number of cells left after placing all 2x2 icons.

3. **Screens for 1x1 icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are enough to fit all 1x1 icons, we use the current number of screens.
   - If not, we calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15`.

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly, including edge cases where no icons are present.
