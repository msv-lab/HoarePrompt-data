Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for x and y. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(x, y):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
