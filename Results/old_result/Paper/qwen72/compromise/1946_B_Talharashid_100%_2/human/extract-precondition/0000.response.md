Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in the context of a test case, where the first parameter is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of parameters for each test case. Each pair consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
