Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0.***
