Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least `n` elements, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0. `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which represents the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain the positive integers provided by the user within the specified range.
- The list `l` remains the list of integers provided by the user, but it must have at least `n` elements to ensure the loop runs the required number of times.
- The variable `c` will be the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0.
- The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0.
