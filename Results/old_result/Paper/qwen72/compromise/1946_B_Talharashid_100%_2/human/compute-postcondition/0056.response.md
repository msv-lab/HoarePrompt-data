The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input provided by the user, which is converted to an integer and used as the upper limit for the range. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than this upper limit. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and the upper limit must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution, the input for the loop range must be greater than 1**
