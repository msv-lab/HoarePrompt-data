Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `c` is 0.
- The code snippet `c += ele` increments `c` by the value of `ele`.
- Since `c` was initially 0, after the execution of the code, `c` is now equal to `ele`.
- The initial state also specifies that if `ele` is a negative integer and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. However, since `c` is now set to `ele`, this condition is not applicable.
- The value of `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0, as per the initial state.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
