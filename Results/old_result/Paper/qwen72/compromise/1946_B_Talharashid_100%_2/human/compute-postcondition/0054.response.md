Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new value of `maxi` is the maximum value observed between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
