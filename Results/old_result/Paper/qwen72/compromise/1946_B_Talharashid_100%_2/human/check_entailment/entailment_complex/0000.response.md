Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `l` of `n` integers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `c` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of contiguous subarrays.
   - `maxi` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays found.

3. **Loop to Find Maximum Contiguous Subarray Sum:**
   - The loop iterates through each element `ele` in the array `l`.
   - If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it resets `c` to 0 and updates `maxi` with the maximum value of `c` encountered so far.
   - If `ele` is non-negative, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` with the maximum value of `c`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the result using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Contiguous Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays using a sliding window approach. However, it only considers non-negative elements and resets the sum when a negative element is encountered. This approach is not optimal for finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, which should include both positive and negative elements.
  - The correct approach to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray is to use Kadane's algorithm, which can handle both positive and negative elements.

- **Final Formula:**
  - The formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. However, this formula is incorrect.
  - The correct formula should be \((\text{sum(l)} + k \times \text{maxi}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). This is because each operation can add the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray to the total sum of the array, and this can be done `k` times.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm
        maxi = max_subarray_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            maxi = max(maxi + ele, ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, maxi)
        
        # Calculate the total sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        # Calculate the final result
        result = (total_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 1000000007
        
        print(result)

# Helper function to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    for ele in arr[1:]:
        max_current = max(ele, max_current + ele)
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current)
    return max_global

# Call the function to process the test cases
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Kadane's Algorithm:**
  - `maxi` keeps track of the maximum sum of the current subarray.
  - `max_subarray_sum` keeps track of the maximum sum of any subarray found so far.
  - The loop iterates through each element, updating `maxi` and `max_subarray_sum` accordingly.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The total sum of the array `l` is calculated.
  - The final result is computed using the correct formula \((\text{sum(l)} + k \times \text{max_subarray_sum}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the suboptimal approach for finding the maximum contiguous subarray sum and the incorrect final formula. The corrected program uses Kadane's algorithm and the correct formula to solve the problem.
