### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads from standard input and processes each line starting from the second line (skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases).
   - It correctly splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Handling:**
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**
     - The function prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`.
     - This is correct because if `n == k`, all cyclic shifts of the array will be sorted. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` will have all three cyclic shifts `[3, 3, 3]`, `[3, 3, 3]`, and `[3, 3, 3]` sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**
     - The function prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect. The function should not always print `-1` when `n != k`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Case 3: `k < 2`**
   - The function prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`).
   - This is correct because if `k = 1`, the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift: itself. If `k = 0`, the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` will have no sorted cyclic shifts, but the problem guarantees that `1 \leq k \leq n`, so this case is not possible.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the case where `k < 2` and the case where `k >= 2` and `n == k`. However, it incorrectly handles the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` by always printing `-1`, which is not always the correct answer.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` properly. It should generate an array that satisfies the conditions instead of always printing `-1`.
