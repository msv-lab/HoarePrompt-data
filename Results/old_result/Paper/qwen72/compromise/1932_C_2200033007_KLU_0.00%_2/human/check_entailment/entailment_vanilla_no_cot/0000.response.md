Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step, but it does not do this correctly. Instead, it appends the elements being removed to a list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order. This does not match the requirement to output the product of the current state of the array at each command.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The program does not take the modulo `m` at each step of the product calculation. It should calculate the product of the current state of the array and then take the modulo `m` before appending the result to the answer list.

3. **Order of Operations**: The program processes the commands and then calculates the product in reverse order, which is incorrect. It should calculate the product and take the modulo `m` at each step while processing the commands in the given order.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as intended:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product)
    return b

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Product Calculation**: The product of the current state of the array is calculated and updated at each step.
- **Modulo Operation**: The product is taken modulo `m` at each step to ensure the correct remainder is output.
- **Order of Operations**: The commands are processed in the given order, and the product is updated and output accordingly.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem description.
