### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

4. **Product Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes a variable `p` to 1 to keep track of the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying each element to `p` and appending the result to the list `ans`.
   - However, this approach is incorrect because it calculates the product of the elements that have been removed, not the product of the elements in the array `a` at each step before removing an element.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which corresponds to the remainders of the product of the elements that have been removed, not the product of the elements in the array `a` at each step before removing an element.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The program does not correctly calculate the product of the elements in the array `a` at each step before removing an element. Instead, it calculates the product of the elements that have been removed, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The product of the elements in the array `a` should be calculated before each command is executed, and the remainder should be taken at that point.
- After each command, the corresponding element should be removed from the array `a`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[i]) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[0], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[-1], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            a.pop()
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product of all elements in `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
  - For each command, the current product is appended to the list `b`.
  - To remove an element, the product is divided by that element using modular inverse (since we are working with modulo `m`).
- **Modular Inverse:**
  - The modular inverse of an element `x` modulo `m` is calculated using `pow(x, m-2, m)`, which works because `m` is a positive integer and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the product of the elements in the array `a` before each command is executed.

Final: **False**
