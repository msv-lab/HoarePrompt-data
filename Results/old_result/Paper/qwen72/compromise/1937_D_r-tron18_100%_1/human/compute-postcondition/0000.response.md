Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in `s1` is '>'**

Explanation: The code creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all positions in the string `s1` where the character is '>'. The length of `pre` will be the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The original string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
