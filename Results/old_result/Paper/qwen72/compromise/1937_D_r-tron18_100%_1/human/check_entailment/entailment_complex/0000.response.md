### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function calculates the difference between the last position in `arr` and the position `times` moves before the last position.
     - It is used to help calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid in `func_2`.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
     - It uses two lists: `pre` and `suffZero` to keep track of positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - It also uses `accumulate` to create a prefix sum list `preOne` for the positions of '>' characters.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the `ans` list with the calculated times for each starting position.

3. **Logic and Implementation:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of positions where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum list of `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to [0] and will be used to keep track of the cumulative positions of '<' characters from the end.
     - `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

   - **Loop:**
     - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the positions of '<' and '>' characters.
       - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time similarly.
     - The function then prints the `ans` list.

4. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for calculating the time in both cases (when the character is '<' or '>') is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the movement and inversion of the pinball, and the time calculations are accurate based on the provided logic.
