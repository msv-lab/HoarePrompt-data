### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The function constructs a template `t` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` to the template as a lowercase letter.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` to the template as an uppercase letter.
   - This part of the code is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Matching Strings `a` and `b` to the Template:**
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - This part of the code is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Matching String `c` to the Template:**
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the template character.
     - If the character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the logic for `c` is incorrect. The function should ensure that `c` does not match the template, but the current logic is checking if `c` matches the template in the same way as `a` and `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This part of the code is correct in terms of the final output logic, but it relies on the incorrect matching logic for `c`.

### Corrected Matching Logic for `c`:
- For `c` to not match the template:
  - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` should be different from the template character.
  - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` should be the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the matching logic for `c`. The corrected program ensures that `c` does not match the template, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
