Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the template and checking the matches has a flaw. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the case:
- The strings `a` and `b` are `abc` and `def` respectively. They differ in all positions, so a valid template could be `ABC` (all uppercase).
- The string `c` is `ghi`, which does not match the template `ABC` because all its characters are lowercase and different from the uppercase template characters.
- However, the program incorrectly constructs the template and fails to recognize this valid case, leading to an incorrect output of `NO`.
