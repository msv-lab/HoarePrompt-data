Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. `match_c` is `False` if any character in `template` is a lowercase letter and does not match the corresponding character in `c`, or if any character in `template` is not a lowercase letter and matches the corresponding character in `c` in a case-insensitive manner. Otherwise, `match_c` is `True`. `match_a_b` remains `True` or `False` based on the initial conditions described. Additionally, either `match_a_b` is `False`, or `match_c` is `True`.**
