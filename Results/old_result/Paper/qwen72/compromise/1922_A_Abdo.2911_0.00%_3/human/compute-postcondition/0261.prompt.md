You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n, a, b, c` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])

        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
                ].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1` (initial `t` minus the number of iterations), `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the loop prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. It processes multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` between 1 and 1000, and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
