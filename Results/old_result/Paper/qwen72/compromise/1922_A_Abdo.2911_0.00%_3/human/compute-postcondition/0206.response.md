Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `template[0]` is a lowercase letter and `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[0]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.***
