Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. `match_a_b` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
