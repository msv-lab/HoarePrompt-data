Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, and `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The list `template` will have `n` elements, where each element is either the character from `a` at the same position if it matches the character in `b` at that position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
