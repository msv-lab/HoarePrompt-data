Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` contains the first character of `a` and the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same) or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` (if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different), and the uppercase version of the second character of `a` is appended to `template`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 2, and `template` is a list. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` contains the first character of `a`, the uppercase version of the second character of `a`, and the third character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the first character of `a`, the uppercase version of the second character of `a`, and the uppercase version of the third character of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
