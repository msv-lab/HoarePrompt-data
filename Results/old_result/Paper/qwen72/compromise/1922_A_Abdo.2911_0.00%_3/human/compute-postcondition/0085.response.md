Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `match_c` is `False` if any character in `template` is a lowercase letter and does not match the corresponding character in `c`, or if any character in `template` is not a lowercase letter and matches the corresponding character in `c` in a case-insensitive manner. Otherwise, `match_c` is `True`.
   - `match_a_b` remains `True` or `False` based on the initial conditions described.
   - Additionally, either `match_a_b` is `False`, or `match_c` is `True`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the conditions, we need to determine if the print statement will execute and what it will print.

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('NO')` is a simple statement that prints the string 'NO'.
- The conditions provided do not affect the print statement directly. They are used to determine the values of `match_c` and `match_a_b`, but the print statement itself does not depend on these variables.

### Conclusion:
- Since the print statement is `print('NO')`, it will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `match_c` and `match_a_b`.

Output: **NO**
