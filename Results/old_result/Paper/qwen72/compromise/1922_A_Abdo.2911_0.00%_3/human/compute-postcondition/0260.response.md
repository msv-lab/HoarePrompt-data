The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function also handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. It processes multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` between 1 and 1000, and returns a result for each test case.**
