Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed, and either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.***
