Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions are met, otherwise `True`. If `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.***
