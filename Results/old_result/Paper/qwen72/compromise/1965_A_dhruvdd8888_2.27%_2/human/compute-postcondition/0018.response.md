Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers from the input, processes the list to determine a winner between 'Alice' and 'Bob', and prints the winner. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output, which is either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the input list. **
