You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and piles is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the set of strings from the input, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the set of strings from the input, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `cd` is the number of consecutive integers starting from the first element in `nums` (excluding the 0 at the beginning) until the first gap greater than 1 is encountered, or until the end of the list if all elements are consecutive. The values of `t`, `n`, `piles`, and `N` remain unchanged.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of elements in the list `piles`, and `piles` is a list of integers. Depending on the input, the function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' and always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
