Postcondition: **`cd` is the number of consecutive integers starting from the first element in `nums` (excluding the 0 at the beginning) until the first gap greater than 1 is encountered, or until the end of the list if all elements are consecutive. `cd` is an odd number. The values of `t`, `n`, `piles`, and `N` remain unchanged.**
