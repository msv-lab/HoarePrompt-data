Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the number of unique pile sizes and their differences, rather than the actual game rules. The game rules state that players must remove the same number of stones from each nonempty pile, and the player who cannot make a move loses. 

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, which will leave the piles as \( [0, 1, 2] \). Then, Bob will be forced to choose \( k = 1 \) again, leaving the piles as \( [0, 0, 1] \). Finally, Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) again, emptying the last pile and winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this input.
