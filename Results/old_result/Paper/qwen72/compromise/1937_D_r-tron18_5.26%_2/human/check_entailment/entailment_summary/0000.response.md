### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list and the element a certain number of positions from the end.
     - It is used to compute the cumulative sums or differences needed for the main function `func_2`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the cumulative sums and calculating the time for each cell.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices in `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0, which will store the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters.

   - **Main Loop**:
     - For each cell from right to left:
       - If the cell contains '>', it updates the cumulative sums and calculates the time using the `func_1` function.
       - If the cell contains '<', it updates the cumulative sums and calculates the time using the `func_1` function.
     - The final result is stored in the `ans` list and printed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the time for each cell.
   - The logic for calculating the time based on the cumulative sums and the position of the pinball is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, when used together, correctly solve the problem as described. The `func_2` function processes the string and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell, taking into account the inversion of characters and the cumulative sums of indices.

Correctness: **True**
