Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2` if `n` is odd or `n - 3` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - 4` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - 6`**

The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so it is now `n - 6`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
