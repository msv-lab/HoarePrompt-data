Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so `ind` is now `n - 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. `n` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, and `p` is still a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n` and all other elements are 0.
