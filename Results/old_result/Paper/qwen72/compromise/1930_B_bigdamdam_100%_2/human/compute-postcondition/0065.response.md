Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is the last even number less than `n`, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from index 0) is filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the rest of the elements are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - (i + 2)`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is the last even number less than `n`.
- `p` is a list where the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) are filled with values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent even index. The elements at odd indices remain zeros.
- `ind` is equal to `n - (i + 2)`, which is the value of `ind` after the last iteration of the loop.
