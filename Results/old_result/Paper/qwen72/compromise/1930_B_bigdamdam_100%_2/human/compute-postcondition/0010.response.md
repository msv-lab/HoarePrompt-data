The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with `p[0]` set to `n` and `p[2]` set to `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`**
