Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, and `ind` is equal to `n`.** 

The code assigns the value of `n` to `ind`, so `ind` now holds the same value as `n`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
