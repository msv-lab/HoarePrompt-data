The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 5.
- `i` is 3.
- `ind` is increased by 2 (though `ind` is not part of the loop head, we only need to consider `i` and `n`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 to 5, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 5).

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind` before the increment, `p[3]` is assigned the value of `ind` before the increment, `ind` is increased by 2**
