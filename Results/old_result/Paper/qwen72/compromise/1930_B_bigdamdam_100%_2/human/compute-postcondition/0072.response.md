Output State: **`n` must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `p[1]` is assigned the value of `ind` before the increment, `p[3]` is assigned the value of `ind` before the increment, `ind` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, but the values of `p[1]` and `p[3]` remain assigned to the value of `ind` before the increment. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
