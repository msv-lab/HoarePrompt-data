Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0], p[2], p[4], ..., p[n-2]` are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd) respectively, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - (n // 2) * 2` (or -1 if `n` is odd).**

In natural language, this means:
- `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `i` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- The list `p` is modified such that every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is set to a value that decreases by 2 starting from `n` (or `n-1` if `n` is even). The values in `p` at these positions are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` (or 1 if `n` is odd).
- All other elements in `p` remain 0.
- `ind` is updated to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, which is `0` if `n` is even and `-1` if `n` is odd.
