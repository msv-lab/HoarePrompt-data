Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - 2` and all other elements are 0, `ind` is `n - 4`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so `ind` becomes `n - 2 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 4`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
- The value of `i` is still `n` if `n` is odd or `n - 1` if `n` is even.
- The list `p` still has `n` elements, with `p[i]` being `n - 2` and all other elements being 0.
