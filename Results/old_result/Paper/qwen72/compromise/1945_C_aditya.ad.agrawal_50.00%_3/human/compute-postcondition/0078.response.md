Output State: **`pos` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 1, if `i` is 0, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`. `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`, with the current value of `b_d` being less than or equal to `abs(n / 2)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
- Since `pos` is 1, `b_d` becomes `abs(n / 2 - 1)`.
- The previous condition that `b_d` was greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)` is no longer valid, so the new condition is that `b_d` is less than or equal to `abs(n / 2)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
