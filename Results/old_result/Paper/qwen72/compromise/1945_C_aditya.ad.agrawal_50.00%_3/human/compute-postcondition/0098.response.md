Output State: **`pos` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`**. 

The value of `b_d` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
