Output State: **`pos` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `ans` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `pos` is 3.
- The code snippet `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 3) to `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans` is now 3.
