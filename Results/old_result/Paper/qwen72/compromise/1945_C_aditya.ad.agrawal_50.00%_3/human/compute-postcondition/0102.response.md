Output State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied, and `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, `b_d`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, and `b_d` are still valid.
