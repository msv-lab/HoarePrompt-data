Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing '0' and '1'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the position `pos` that minimizes the absolute difference between the number of houses on the left and right sides while ensuring that the number of residents preferring the right side is at least half of the remaining houses and the number of residents preferring the left side is at least half of the houses already processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and `t` is 0. **
