Output State: **`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of ones in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is 30001, `t` is non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b_d` is updated to 30001.
- All other variables (`pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
