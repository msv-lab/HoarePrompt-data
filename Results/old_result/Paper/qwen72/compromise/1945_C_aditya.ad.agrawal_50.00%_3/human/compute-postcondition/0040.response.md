The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how the loop progresses based on these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element in `arr`.
- `pos` is increased by 1.
- Depending on the value of `i` (0 or 1), `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` are adjusted.
- If certain conditions are met, `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr` needs to be considered. Since `i` is the second element in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`**
