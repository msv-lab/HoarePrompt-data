Output State: **`pos` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 2, `i` is the second element in `arr`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is 2, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 2`, `o_r` is `o`. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 2`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to the value of `pos`, which is 2. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
