To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects that are directly involved in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in arr:
```

The only object in the loop head is `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must be a non-empty list. The other variables mentioned in the state are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `pos` is 0
- `z_l` is 0
- `o_l` is 0
- `z_r` is the count of zeros in `arr`
- `o_r` is the count of ones in `arr`
- `ans` is 0
- `t` is non-zero
- `n` is an input integer
- `input_string` is the user input string
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer
- `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`
- `o` is the count of ones in `arr`
- `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`
- If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must be a non-empty list. The other variables can remain as they are, as they do not affect the loop's ability to start.

State: **`arr` must be a non-empty list of integers**
