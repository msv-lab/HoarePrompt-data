Output State: **`arr` must be a non-empty list of integers, `pos` is increased by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1.** 

The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `arr`, `pos`, `i`, and `o_l` are still valid.
