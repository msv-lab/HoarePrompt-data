You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: `n` remains the same, `k` is reduced to a value that satisfies the loop conditions, and `l` is a modified list with elements rearranged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. It modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` by rearranging its elements based on the value of `k`. The function returns the modified list `l` after performing the rearrangement. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `k` is reduced through the loop, and `l` is a list with elements rearranged according to the specified logic.

Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to n^2 // 2, with `max_k` being greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from user input where `1 <= n <= 200,000` and `0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000`. It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum allowed value (`max_k`). If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The maximum allowed value of `k` (`max_k`) is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, or `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces. It then prints a blank line. The function does not return any value, and the list `l` remains unchanged.

        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`. The new values of `n` and `k` are unknown, but they still satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_2`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`. The final state of the program is that `func_4` has either printed 'NO' and returned, or it has called `func_1` and `func_3` without printing anything.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the `func_2` function incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem description requires the program to output "No" if no suitable permutation exists, but the program returns a tuple `(0, 0)` instead. This tuple is then incorrectly used in `func_4` to print "NO" when it should directly print "No" without the tuple.

Additionally, the `func_1` function does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the program should output "No" because no permutation of length 4 can have a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this case correctly and may return an invalid permutation.
