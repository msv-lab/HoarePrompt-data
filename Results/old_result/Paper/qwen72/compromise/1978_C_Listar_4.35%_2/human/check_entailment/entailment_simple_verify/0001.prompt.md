You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function checks if a valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.
   - It first checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If `n` is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

3. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, and for each element, it checks if it can be moved to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` is zero, it returns the list as is.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i` and moves the last element to the beginning of the list.
   - This function aims to construct the permutation by moving elements to the correct positions to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation.

5. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function is the main function that handles the input and output.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the permutation.

### Analysis:
- **Function 2:**
  - The logic to check if `k` is even and if `k` is within the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct.
  - The maximum value calculation is correct for both odd and even `n`.

- **Function 1:**
  - The logic to generate the permutation is not straightforward and may not always produce a valid permutation.
  - The function attempts to move elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that the final permutation will have the correct Manhattan value.
  - The condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent move of the last element to position `-k` is not clearly explained and may not be correct.

- **Function 3:**
  - The function correctly prints the permutation if a valid one is found.

- **Function 4:**
  - The function correctly handles the input and output, calling the appropriate functions to check for a valid permutation and generate it if possible.

### Conclusion:
- The program may not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value, especially in the `func_1` function.
- The logic in `func_1` is not robust enough to handle all cases and may produce incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
