### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0` indicating that no suitable permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. For odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`, and for even `n`, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `0, 0` indicating that no suitable permutation exists.
   - If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as input and generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, and for each element, it checks if `k` can be reduced to zero by rearranging the elements.
   - If `k` can be reduced to zero, it rearranges the elements accordingly and returns the modified list.
   - The function ensures that the final list `l` is a permutation of length `n` with the correct Manhattan value.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes a list `l` as input and prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It is used to output the result when a suitable permutation is found.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`. If `func_2` returns `0, 0`, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - If `n` and `k` are valid, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles the input and checks the validity of `n` and `k`.
- **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` correctly generates a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by rearranging the elements.
- **Output**: `func_3` correctly prints the result in the required format.
- **Main Function**: `func_4` correctly orchestrates the calls to `func_2`, `func_1`, and `func_3` to handle each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description and constraints. It ensures that the permutation generated has the correct Manhattan value and handles cases where no such permutation exists.

### Correctness:
**True**
