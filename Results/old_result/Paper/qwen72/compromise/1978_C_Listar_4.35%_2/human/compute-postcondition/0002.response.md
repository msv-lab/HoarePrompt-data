The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`, and the new values of `n` and `k` are unknown but still satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. However, the current value of `n` is 0, which is not relevant to the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement simply outputs a constant string, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
