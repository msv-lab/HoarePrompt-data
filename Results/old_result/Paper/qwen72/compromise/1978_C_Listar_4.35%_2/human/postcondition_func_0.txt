The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. It modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` by rearranging its elements based on the value of `k`. The function returns the modified list `l` after performing the rearrangement. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `k` is reduced through the loop, and `l` is a list with elements rearranged according to the specified logic.
