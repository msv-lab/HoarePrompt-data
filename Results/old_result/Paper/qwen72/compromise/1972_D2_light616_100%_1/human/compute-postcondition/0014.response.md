To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are updated to the input integers.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is 1.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(x + y) * x = (1 + 3) * 1 = 4`
     - `(x + y) * y = (1 + 3) * 3 = 12`

4. **Evaluating the Conditions**:
   - For the first condition: `4 <= n` must be true. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 3, this condition is satisfied.
   - For the second condition: `12 <= m` must be true. Since `m` is already greater than or equal to 6, this condition is also satisfied.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since both conditions are already satisfied with the current values of `n` and `m`, no adjustments are needed to the values of `n` and `m`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are fixed and do not need adjustment.

### Conclusion:
Since the current state already satisfies the loop conditions, no adjustments are necessary. The loop can proceed with the same state.

State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 1**
