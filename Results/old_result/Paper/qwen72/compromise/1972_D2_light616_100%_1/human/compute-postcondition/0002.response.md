The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the program state. However, based on the initial state, we can infer that the variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range unless `func_1()` modifies it.

Given that no information about the function's behavior is provided, we assume that `func_1()` does not alter the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4**
