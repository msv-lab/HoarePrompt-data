Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the loop condition is satisfied. Additionally, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1.**
