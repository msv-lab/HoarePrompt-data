The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- `x + y` is 4
- `(x + y) * x` is 4 * 1 = 4
- `(x + y) * y` is 4 * 3 = 12

So, the expressions become:
- `n // 4`
- `m // 12`

The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n // 4, m // 12)`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6
- `cnt` is 1

Let's calculate the new value of `cnt`:

- `n // 4` will be at least 0 (since `n` is at least 3)
- `m // 12` will be at least 0 (since `m` is at least 6)

The minimum of these two values will be added to `cnt`.

Since `cnt` starts at 1, the new value of `cnt` will be:
- `cnt = 1 + min(n // 4, m // 12)`

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 1 + min(n // 4, m // 12)**
