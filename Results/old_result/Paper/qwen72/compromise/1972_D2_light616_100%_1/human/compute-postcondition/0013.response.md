The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `n` and `m` still hold true. The GCD condition for `x` and `y` also remains true since the GCD of 1 and 3 is still 1, which means `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the input integers, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 1.**
