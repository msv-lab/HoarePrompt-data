The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Since `n` is at least 20 and `x` and `y` are integers with a GCD of 1, the exact value of the increment depends on the specific values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `m`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `n // ((x + y) * x)` computes the integer division of `n` by the product of `(x + y)` and `x`.
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` computes the integer division of `m` by the product of `(x + y)` and `y`.
- The minimum of these two results is added to `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the increment. However, we know that `cnt` is increased by this minimum value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 20, `x` and `y` are integers such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.**
