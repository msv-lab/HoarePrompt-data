Output State: **`n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `x` is 5, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(5 + y) * 5 > n` or `(5 + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n // ((5 + y) * 5)` and `m // ((5 + y) * y)` for each iteration where `math.gcd(5, y) == 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5.
- The condition for `y` is updated to reflect the new value of `x`, which is now 5.
- The calculation for `cnt` is also updated to use the new value of `x`, which is 5.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are still at least 18.
