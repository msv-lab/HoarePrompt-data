Output State: **`n` and `m` remain as the input integers, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain unchanged throughout the loop because they are used as thresholds in the loop conditions but are not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: The loop increments `x` until `x * x > n`. Therefore, the final value of `x` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- **`y`**: After the loop finishes, `y` is reset to 1 because the inner loop resets `y` to 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.
- **`cnt`**: This variable accumulates the count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, and both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied. The final value of `cnt` is the total count of such pairs found during the entire execution of the loop.
