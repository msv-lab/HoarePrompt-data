The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of two expressions: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given that `x` is 3 and `y` is 3, the expression `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18`, and `(x + y) * y` also evaluates to 18. Therefore, the expressions become `n // 18` and `m // 18`.

Since both `n` and `m` are at least 18, the minimum of `n // 18` and `m // 18` will be at least 1. Thus, `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is increased by 1.**
