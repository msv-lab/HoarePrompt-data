### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and its components to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - Iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If true, increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Prints the final count `cnt`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times.

#### Function Summary:
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - Reads an integer `t` from the user input, where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times.
  - Does not return any value.
  - After the function concludes, `t` remains the same integer that was input by the user, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` correctly reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   - The loop structure in `func_1` ensures that all possible pairs \((a, b)\) are considered within the given constraints.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are coprime, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The increment of `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each \((x, y)\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\) correctly, as it prints 0 (no valid pairs).
   - The program also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) as shown in the example.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the program runs efficiently within the given constraints. The time complexity is approximately \(O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{m})\), which is feasible for the given limits.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles multiple test cases, checks the conditions accurately, and counts the valid pairs efficiently. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
