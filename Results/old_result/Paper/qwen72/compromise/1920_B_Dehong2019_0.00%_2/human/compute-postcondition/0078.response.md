Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting 2 times `a[i + x]`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and the initial `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum value between the initial `ans1` and `ans2`.***
