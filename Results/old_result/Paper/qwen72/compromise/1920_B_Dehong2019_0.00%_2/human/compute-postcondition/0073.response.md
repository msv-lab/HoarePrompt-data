Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- `ans2` is assigned the value of `ans1`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `ans1` is still the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.
- `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the initial `ans2`, but since `ans2` is now equal to `ans1`, `ans` remains the same as before.
