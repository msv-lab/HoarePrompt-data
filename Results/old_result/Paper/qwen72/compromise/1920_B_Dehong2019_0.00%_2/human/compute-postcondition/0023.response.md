Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `k` must be greater than 1. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` and `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. In this case, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x >= n`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` and `a[i]`, and `ans2` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. In this case, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.***
