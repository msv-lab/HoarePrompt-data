Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the variable `ans` to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The initial values of `ans1` and `ans2` are not specified, but `ans` now holds the maximum of these two values.
