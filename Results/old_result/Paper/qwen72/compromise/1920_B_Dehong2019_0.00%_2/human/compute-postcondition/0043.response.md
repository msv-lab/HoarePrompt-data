Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = ans1` assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` now holds the same value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`, which are now the same, so `ans` remains unchanged.
