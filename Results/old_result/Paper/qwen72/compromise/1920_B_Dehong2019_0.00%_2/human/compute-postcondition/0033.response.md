Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`. If `i + x < n` for any `i` in the range `0` to `k-1`, then `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` for each such `i`. `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` based on the input provided. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are now input integers, and the rest of the state remains as described in the initial state.
