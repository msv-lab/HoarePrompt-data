Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further adjusted by subtracting 2 times the sum of elements from `a[x]` to `a[k + x - 1]`. `ans` is the maximum value between the final `ans1` and the initial `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)` reads a line of input, splits it into individual integers, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to `a`.
- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order.
- The conditions and expressions involving `ans1` and `ans2` remain as they were described in the initial state.
