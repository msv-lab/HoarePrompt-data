The provided Python code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable statements that modify the variables or the program state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
