Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the first element in `inp`, `ans` is 0 if `a` (the first element in `inp`) is less than or equal to `y` (which is also `a`), and `ans` is 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`. In both cases, `a` is the first element in `inp` and `a` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, the expression `x == y` evaluates to `False`.***
