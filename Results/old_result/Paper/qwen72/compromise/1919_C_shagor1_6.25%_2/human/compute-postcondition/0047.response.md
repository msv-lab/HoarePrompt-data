Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in `inp`, and `a` is greater than `y`. The expression `x == y` evaluates to `True`.**

The expression `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since both `x` and `y` are assigned the value `n + 1`, the expression evaluates to `True`. The values of `n`, `inp`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, and `a` remain unchanged.
