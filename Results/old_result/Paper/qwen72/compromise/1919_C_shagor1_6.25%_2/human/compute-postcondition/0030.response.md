Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2 or 3, `x` and `y` are updated according to the conditions, and `y` is now equal to `a`. `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 2.**
