Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, the maximum sum for a 1x1 matrix is 1, and this can be achieved with a single operation. However, the program calculates the sum and the number of operations incorrectly for this case.

For `n = 1`:
- The program outputs `1 1` which is correct for the sum but incorrect for the number of operations.
- The program then outputs `1 1 1`, which is correct for the operation, but the logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is flawed.

For `n = 1`, the correct output should be:
```
1 1
1 1 1
```

However, the program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is not correct for this case. Specifically, the loop and the conditions inside it do not handle the `n = 1` case properly, leading to incorrect results.
