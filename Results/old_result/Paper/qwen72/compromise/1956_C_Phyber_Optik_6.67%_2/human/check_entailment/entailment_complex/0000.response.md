Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing a limited number of operations. The operations involve either assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the entire matrix with the maximum value possible, which is \( n \), since the permutation consists of integers from 1 to \( n \).

However, the provided program does not correctly achieve this goal. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop that iterates from 1 to \( n \).
   - It adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) to the total sum if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \).
   - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the total sum.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not always maximize the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be \( n^2 \times n \) (since each element can be \( n \)).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program prints \( n + r \) as the number of operations, where \( r \) is the last value of \( i \) for which \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \).
   - This is not necessarily the correct number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. The correct number of operations should be no more than \( 2n \).

3. **Operation Printing**:
   - The program prints operations for each \( j \) from 1 to \( n + r \).
   - For \( j \leq n \), it prints a type 1 operation (assigning a permutation to a row).
   - For \( j > n \), it prints a type 2 operation (assigning a permutation to a column).
   - The permutations used are always the sequence from 1 to \( n \), which is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To maximize the sum, you should fill the matrix with the maximum value \( n \) in each cell.
   - This can be achieved by performing \( n \) type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) type 2 operations (one for each column), using the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \) for each operation.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not maximize the sum of the matrix and does not use the optimal number of operations.

Correctness: **False**
