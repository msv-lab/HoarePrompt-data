Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `j` is 2.
2. `n + r` must be at least 2.
3. `t` is unchanged.
4. `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
5. `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
6. `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
7. `i` is `n`.
8. `n` remains the input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`2`**: This is a constant value that will be printed as is.
2. **`j % n`**: 
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - The expression `j % n` computes the remainder when 2 is divided by `n`.

### Possible Values:
- If `n` is 1, then `2 % 1` is 0.
- If `n` is 2, then `2 % 2` is 0.
- If `n` is greater than 2, then `2 % n` is 2.

### Final Output:
Since `n` is an input integer and can vary, the exact value of `j % n` depends on `n`. However, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `n`.

Output: **2, 0 (if n is 1 or 2) or 2, 2 (if n is greater than 2)**

This means the output will be:
- **2, 0** if `n` is 1 or 2.
- **2, 2** if `n` is greater than 2.
