Postcondition: ***`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and 0 otherwise, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.***
