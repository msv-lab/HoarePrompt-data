Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.
- `j` is 1.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
