The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 2), and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop condition `i < n + 1` to hold true.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `sum`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n` and `r` is 0.**
