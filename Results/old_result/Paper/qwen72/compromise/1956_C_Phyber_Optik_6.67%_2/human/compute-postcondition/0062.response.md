The value of `sum` is incremented by the product of `i` and `n`. Given that `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, the value of `sum` will be increased by `3 * n`.

- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, then:
  - `j` is `n + 1`
  - `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`
  - `r` is 2
  - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`
  - `t` is unchanged
  - After the code execution, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n`

- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, then:
  - `j` is `n + r`
  - `sum` is `2 * n + 2 * n`
  - `r` is 0
  - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`
  - `t` is unchanged
  - After the code execution, `sum` becomes `2 * n + 2 * n + 3 * n`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`j` is `n + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `n + r` otherwise. `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`. `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `2 * n + 2 * n + 3 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`. `r` is 2 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and 0 otherwise. `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
