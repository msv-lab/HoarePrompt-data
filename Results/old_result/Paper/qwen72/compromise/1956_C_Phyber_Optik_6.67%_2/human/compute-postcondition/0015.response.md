Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `4 * n` and `r` is 0.***
