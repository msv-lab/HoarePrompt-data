Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `j` is `n + r` where `r` is 0 or 1. `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `sum` is `3 * n`. `r` is 3.** 

The value of `r` is now 3, as it has been assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
