Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- `n + r` must be at least 3.
- `t` is unchanged (we don't have a specific value for `t`).
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t` (we don't have a specific value for `_`).
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer (we don't have a specific value for `n`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`**:
   - The first value printed is the integer `2`.

2. **Value of `j % n`**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is an input integer, but we don't have a specific value for `n`.
   - The expression `j % n` calculates the remainder when `j` (which is 3) is divided by `n`.
   - Since `n` is not specified, the exact value of `j % n` cannot be determined. However, we know that `j % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **`end=' '`**:
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Final Output:
The code will print the integer `2` followed by the result of `3 % n`, and the output will end with a space.

Output: **2 [3 % n] (where [3 % n] is the remainder when 3 is divided by n)**
