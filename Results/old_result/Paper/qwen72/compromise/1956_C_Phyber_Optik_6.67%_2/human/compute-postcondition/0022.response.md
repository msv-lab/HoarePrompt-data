To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is also not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.

2. **Understanding `sum`:**
   - The value of `sum` is determined by the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - `i * n` is the product of `i` and `n`.

3. **Understanding `r`:**
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
   - Let's analyze the condition:
     - `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
     - `i * n` is the product of `i` and `n`.
     - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
       \[
       \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
       \]
       \[
       \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
       \]
       \[
       n + 1 > 2i
       \]
       \[
       i < \frac{n + 1}{2}
       \]
     - Therefore, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`.

4. **Calculating `sum`:**
   - Since `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, we need to determine which one is used.
   - If `i` is less than `(n + 1) / 2`, then `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) / 2`, then `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, and `r` is the last value of `i` for which `i < (n + 1) / 2`, the condition will be true for all `i` from 1 to `r` and false for `i` from `r + 1` to `n`.
   - Therefore, `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for `i` from 1 to `r` and the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i` from `r + 1` to `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `sum` and `n + r`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `i * n` for `i` from 1 to `r` and the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i` from `r + 1` to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`.

Output: **sum, n + r (where sum is the sum of `i * n` for `i` from 1 to `r` and the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i` from `r + 1` to `n`, and `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`)**
