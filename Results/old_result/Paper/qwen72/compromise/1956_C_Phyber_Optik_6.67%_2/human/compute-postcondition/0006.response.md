Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

The value of `r` is updated to 1, while the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `sum`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is still true.
