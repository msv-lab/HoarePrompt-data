Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `j` is 1.
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `_` is incremented by `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `n + r` must be greater than 0 (the value of `r` is not specified, but it must be such that `n + r > 0`).
- `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the range object, which will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.
- The range function `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

### Output:
- Since `n` is a new input integer, the output will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the new input integer)**
