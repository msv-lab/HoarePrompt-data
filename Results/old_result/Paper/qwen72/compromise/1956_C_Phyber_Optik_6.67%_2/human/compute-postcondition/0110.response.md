To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to start and continue executing.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
```
- The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n + r + 1` (exclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element.
- The range will contain at least one element if `1 < n + r + 1`, which simplifies to `0 < n + r`.

### Given State:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `j` is `n + r` where `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is incremented by `n`
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `n + r` is greater than 0.
- `j` must be initialized to 1 before the loop starts.
- `n` and `r` must be such that `n + r` is greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `j` is 1
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is incremented by `n`
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`
- `n + r` must be greater than 0

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is 1, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n`, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `n + r` must be greater than 0**
