Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the values of `1` and `j`.
   - `1` is a constant integer.
   - `j` is explicitly stated to be 1 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The values of `1` and `j` are both 1.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space.

Output: **1 1 **
