To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute if the range `1` to `n + r + 1` contains at least one value, which means `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `_` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n` (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n + r` is at least 1. Since `r` can be 0, `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true, `j` is 1**
