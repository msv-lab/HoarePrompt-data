Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't have information about `t`'s initial value, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't have information about `_`'s initial value, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 2 (we don't have information about `r`, so it doesn't affect the print statement).
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` remains less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, `j` remains greater than `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 3 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` will be printed.
   - The value of `j` (which is 3) will be printed.
   - The output will end with a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 3 **
