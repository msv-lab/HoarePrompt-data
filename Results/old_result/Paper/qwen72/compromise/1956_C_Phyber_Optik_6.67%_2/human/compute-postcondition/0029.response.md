Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.
- `j` is 1.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**:
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is a positive integer.

2. **`range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **`print(*range(1, n + 1))`**:
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - This means that the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
