Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It calculates a sum and a value `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. The function then prints the calculated sum and `n + r`. Following this, it prints a series of lines for each integer `j` from 1 to `n + r`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1` followed by `j` and the integers from 1 to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2` followed by `j % n` and the integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
