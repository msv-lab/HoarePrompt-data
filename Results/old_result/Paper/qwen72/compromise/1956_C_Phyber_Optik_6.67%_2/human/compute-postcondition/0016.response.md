The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 3
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again

The conditions for `sum` and `r` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
