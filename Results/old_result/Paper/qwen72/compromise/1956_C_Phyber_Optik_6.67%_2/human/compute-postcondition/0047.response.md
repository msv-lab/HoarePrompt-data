The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and go up to `n`. The other variables (`j`, `t`, `_`, `sum`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
