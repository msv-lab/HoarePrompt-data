Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`, where `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't have the initial value of `t`, so we can ignore it for this task).
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't have the initial value of `_`, so we can ignore it for this task).
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't have the value of `r`, so we can ignore it for this task).
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is given as 1 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the print function means that the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` will be printed.
   - The value of `j` (which is 1) will be printed.
   - The output will end with a space.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1 1 **
