Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - The condition `j <= n + r` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
   - If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine `j % n`:**
   - Given `j` is 3, we need to know the value of `n` to compute `j % n`.
   - Since `n` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of `n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first value is `2`.
   - The second value is `3 % n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2` followed by the result of `3 % n`, with a space at the end.

Output: **2, 3 % n (where n is the value of n)**
