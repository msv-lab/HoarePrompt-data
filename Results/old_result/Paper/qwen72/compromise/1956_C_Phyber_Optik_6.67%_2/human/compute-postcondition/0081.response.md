The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the expression `n + r + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is 2
- `n + r` must be at least 2
- `t` is unchanged
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the input integer

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `j < n + r + 1` must still hold true.

- Incrementing `j` by 1, `j` becomes 3.
- The condition `j < n + r + 1` must hold, so `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`j` is 3, `n + r` must be at least 3, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the input integer.**
