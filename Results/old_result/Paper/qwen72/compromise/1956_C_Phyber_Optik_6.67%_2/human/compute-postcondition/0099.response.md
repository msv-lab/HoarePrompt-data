Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `j` is still `n + r`, but now `r` is updated to 2.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `_` is still incremented by 1.
- `sum` remains the same based on the initial condition: it is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2.
