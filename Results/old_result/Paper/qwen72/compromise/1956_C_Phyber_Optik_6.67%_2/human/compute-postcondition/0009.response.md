Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated to `i * n`, where `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `sum` is now equal to `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
