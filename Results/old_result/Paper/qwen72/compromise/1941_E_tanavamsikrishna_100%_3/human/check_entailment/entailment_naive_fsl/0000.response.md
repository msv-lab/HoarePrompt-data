Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the cost of bridge supports. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the installation of supports according to the problem's constraints, particularly the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function incorrectly adds a fixed value to the costs of the first `d` cells and does not ensure that supports are placed at intervals of no more than `d` throughout the row. This can lead to incorrect cost calculations for rows where the optimal placement of supports is not in the first `d` cells.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 100 0 100 0
```
In this case, the optimal placement of supports would be at the first and last columns, and one support in the middle (column 3) to satisfy the distance constraint `d = 2`. The correct cost should be `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as `102` because it adds `100 + 2` to the cost of the second cell, which is not the optimal solution.
