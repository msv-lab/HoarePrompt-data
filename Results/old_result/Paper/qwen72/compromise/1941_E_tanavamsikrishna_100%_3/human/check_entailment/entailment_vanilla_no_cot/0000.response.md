Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. However, the initial cost adjustments and the way the heap is used are incorrect.
   - The initial cost adjustments `row[0] = 1` and `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `i` in range `1` to `d` are not correct. The cost of installing a support in a cell should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, and the initial conditions should be handled correctly.
   - The heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost, but the way it is updated and used to calculate the cost for each cell is flawed. Specifically, the condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):` is incorrect and does not ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not properly read the number of test cases `t` and loop over them. The input for `t` is missing, and the function should be called in a loop for each test case.

3. **General Structure:**
   - The program should have a main function to handle the input and output for multiple test cases. The current structure is incomplete and does not handle the input and output correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def min_cost(row, d):
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1  # Cost of installing support in the first cell
    min_heap = [(dp[0], 0)]
    
    for j in range(1, n):
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < j - d:
            heappop(min_heap)
        dp[j] = min_heap[0][0] + row[j] + 1
        heappush(min_heap, (dp[j], j))
    
    return dp[-1]

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        costs = [min_cost(row, d) for row in rows]
        
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        
        print(min(total_costs))

solve()
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program:**

1. **Function `min_cost`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - `dp[j]` is the minimum cost to install a support in cell `j`.
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of the last `d` cells.
   - The heap is updated to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Function `solve`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `min_cost`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
