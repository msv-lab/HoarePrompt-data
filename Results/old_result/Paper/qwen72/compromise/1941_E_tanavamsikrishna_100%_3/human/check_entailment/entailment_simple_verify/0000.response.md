Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle this constraint.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization of the First `d` Cells:**
   - The function starts by setting `row[0] = 1` and then adds 2 to each of the first `d` cells (excluding the first cell). This is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal placement of supports within the first `d` cells. The cost of installing a support should be `a_{i,j} + 1`, not a fixed value of 2.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The heap is initialized with the first `d` cells of the row, but the values in these cells have already been incorrectly modified. This means the heap does not contain the correct costs for these cells.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The loop that processes the remaining cells in the row (`for i in range(d, len(row))`) is intended to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`. However, the way the heap is used and the costs are updated is flawed.
   - The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect. The distance between supports should be `|j_1 - j_2| - 1`, but the condition is checking `i - (d + 2)`, which is not the correct way to enforce the distance constraint.
   - The cost update `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is also incorrect. It should be based on the minimum cost of the previous supports within the distance `d`, not just the last popped element from the heap.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 100 0 100 0
```
- **Expected Output:** 3
- **Actual Output:** 102

**Explanation:**
- The correct placement of supports would be at the first, third, and last columns, which would give a total cost of `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:
  - `row[0] = 1`
  - `row[1] = 100 + 2 = 102`
  - `row[2] = 0 + 102 + 1 = 103`
  - `row[3] = 100 + 103 + 1 = 204`
  - `row[4] = 0 + 204 + 1 = 205`
- The final cost returned is `row[-1] = 205`, which is clearly incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the installation of supports according to the problem's constraints, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

Final: **False**
