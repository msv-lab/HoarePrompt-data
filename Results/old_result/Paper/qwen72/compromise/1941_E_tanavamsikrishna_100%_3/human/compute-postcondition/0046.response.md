Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It modifies the list `row` by setting the first element to 1, increasing each element from index 1 to d-1 by 2, and updating each element from index d to the second-to-last element based on the minimum values from a heap. The function always returns 0, which is the last element of the list `row`. **
