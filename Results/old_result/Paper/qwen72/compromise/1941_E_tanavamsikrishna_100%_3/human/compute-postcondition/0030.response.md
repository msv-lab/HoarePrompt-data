Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfied the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`; `min_heap` now contains the tuple `(e[0], e[1])` in addition to its previous elements.**
