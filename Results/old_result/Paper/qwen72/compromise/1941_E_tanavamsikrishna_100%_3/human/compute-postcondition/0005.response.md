The code snippet `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. The slice starts at index `i` and includes the next `k` elements. Since `i` is 0, the slice `costs[0:k]` is used, and the sum of these elements is appended to `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`.**
