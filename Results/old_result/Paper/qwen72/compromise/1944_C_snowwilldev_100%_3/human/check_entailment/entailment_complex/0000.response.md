### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `N` and the list `a` of `N` integers.
   - It initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the `cnt` dictionary.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks two conditions:
     - If the count of the integer `i` is 1, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of the integer `i` is 0, it returns `i`.
   - The logic here is to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), or
     - Appears exactly once, and there is another integer that also appears exactly once (i.e., `t >= 2`).

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - If an integer appears exactly once, Alice will try to pick it to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to avoid it.
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and there is another integer that also appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all integers in `a` are the same (e.g., `[1, 1]`), correctly returning 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` exactly once, correctly returning 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It correctly handles the input and output constraints and the optimal play conditions for Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**True**
