The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These integers must satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The function also accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The function returns the result of each test case, which is not specified in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` that satisfy specific conditions. It also accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. The function returns the result of each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
