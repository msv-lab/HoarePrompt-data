### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function first checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it means Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip. Since Bob can only move up and Alice can only move down, they will never meet, and the game will end in a draw. This is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Even and Odd Distance Handling**:
   - The function then calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This is the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function checks if Alice can win by ensuring that Alice's chip can move into a position where Bob's chip will be in the next move. This is done by calculating the range of possible positions for Bob's chip after `x` moves (`l` and `r`), and checking if Alice's chip can be within one move of this range. This logic is correct.
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function checks if Bob can win by ensuring that Bob's chip can move into a position where Alice's chip will be in the next move. This is done by calculating the range of possible positions for Alice's chip after `x` moves (`l` and `r`), and checking if Bob's chip can be within this range. This logic is also correct.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure that the calculated positions `l` and `r` do not go out of the board's bounds.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The use of `print(*([...], [...])[condition])` is a concise way to select the appropriate result based on the condition.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly handle the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly checks the initial positions, calculates the possible meeting points, and handles boundary conditions. The logic for determining the winner or a draw is sound.

Correctness: **True**
