The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. It reads an integer `t` from input, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the six integers from input, evaluates certain conditions, and prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on those conditions. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes with all results printed to the console. The function does not return any value.
