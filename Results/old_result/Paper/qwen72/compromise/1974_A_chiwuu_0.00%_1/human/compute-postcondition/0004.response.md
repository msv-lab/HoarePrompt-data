Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the user, where `a` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `b` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. For each pair, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15 × 15 grid cells required to display all the icons, considering the different sizes of the icons. The function does not return any value. **
