The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` starts at 0 by default in the `range(n)` function.

State: **`x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon, `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, both `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
