The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 \le k_i \le 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should output -1 if there is no valid distribution of coins, or n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 \le x_i \le 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
