Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, the problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted, and then the maximum beauty can be calculated by summing the differences between the last and the first elements, the second last and the second elements, and so on, until the middle of the array is reached. This approach ensures that the largest possible differences are included in the sum, thus maximizing the beauty.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            beauty += (a[n - 1 - i] - a[i])
        print(beauty)
```

This program will correctly compute the maximum beauty for each test case.
