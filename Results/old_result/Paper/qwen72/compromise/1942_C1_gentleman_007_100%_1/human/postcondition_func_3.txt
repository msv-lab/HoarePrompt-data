The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`, where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and `v` is a value of any type. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, each containing `m` copies of the value `v`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list of lists, with the specified dimensions and values, and no changes are made to the input parameters.
