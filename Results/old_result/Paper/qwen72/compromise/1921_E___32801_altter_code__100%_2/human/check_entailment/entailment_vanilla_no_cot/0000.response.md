Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The program calls `func_1()` inside the loop that processes the test cases, but `func_1()` is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Turn**: The logic for determining the outcome when Bob's turn is considered is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and calculations for Bob's moves are not correctly implemented.

3. **Overcomplicated Logic**: The logic for determining the outcome is overly complicated and contains unnecessary steps. The problem can be solved with a simpler approach by considering the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips and the parity of the distance between them.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the outcome of the game, we need to consider the following:

- **Initial Position Check**: If Bob's chip is already in the same column as Alice's chip and Alice can move directly to Bob's chip in one move, Alice wins.
- **Parity Check**: If the distance between Alice and Bob's chips (in terms of rows) is odd, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force a draw. If the distance is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves and force a win unless Bob's chip is in a position where Alice cannot reach it.

Here is a simplified and correct version of the program:

```python
tt = int(input())
for _ in range(tt):
    n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    
    if x2 <= x1:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    
    if (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0:
        if y1 == y2:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Draw')
    else:
        print('Bob')
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **Initial Position Check**: If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob is already in a position where he cannot move up, so the game ends in a draw.
- **Parity Check**: If the distance between Alice and Bob's chips (`x2 - x1`) is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves and eventually win if they are in the same column. If the distance is odd, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force a draw.

This simplified approach ensures that the program correctly determines the outcome of the game for each test case.
