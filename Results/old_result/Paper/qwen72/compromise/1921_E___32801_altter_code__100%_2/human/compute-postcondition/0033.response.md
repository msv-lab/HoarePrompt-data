Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is no value or variable specified to be returned. The `return` statement is empty, which means the function will return `None` by default. However, since the task specifies to describe the output state in natural language and focus on the information we have for any variable or value included in the return, and no such variables or values are included, the output state is simply that the program does not return any value.
