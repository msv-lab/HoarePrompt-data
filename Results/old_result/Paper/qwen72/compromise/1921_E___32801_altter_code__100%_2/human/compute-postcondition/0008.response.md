The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only contains a string literal, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **Alice**
