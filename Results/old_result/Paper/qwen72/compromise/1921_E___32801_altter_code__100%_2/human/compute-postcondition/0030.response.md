Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, and `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `x2` is updated to `r[4] - a`.
- The value of `a` is used in the calculation of `x2`, but its specific value depends on the conditions provided in the initial state.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` remains an even number because `a` is subtracted from `x2`, and `x1` already includes `a` in its calculation.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
