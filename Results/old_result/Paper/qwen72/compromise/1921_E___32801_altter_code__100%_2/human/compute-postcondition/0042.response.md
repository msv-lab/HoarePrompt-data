Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `y1` is now equal to `r[3] + 1 + a`, `y2` is equal to `m`, `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `c` is equal to `m - y1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
