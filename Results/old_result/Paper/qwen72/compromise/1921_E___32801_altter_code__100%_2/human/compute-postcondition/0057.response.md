Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, and `x2` is greater than `x1`. Additionally, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Moreover, `y2` is less than `y1`.***
