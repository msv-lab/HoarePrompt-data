Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `y2` is greater than `y1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by 1, changing it from `r[2]` to `r[2] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `x2` is greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` was initially an odd number, after incrementing `x1` by 1, the difference between `x2` and `x1` becomes an even number. The conditions that `y2` is greater than `y1` and `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1` remain valid.
