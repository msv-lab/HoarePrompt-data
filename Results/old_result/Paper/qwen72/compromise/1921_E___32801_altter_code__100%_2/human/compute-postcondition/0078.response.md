Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided to determine what will be printed when the `print('bob')` statement executes.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
2. `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
3. `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`.
4. `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
5. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
6. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
7. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
8. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
9. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1 - a`.
10. `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
11. `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
12. If `y1` <= `y2`, then:
    - `y1` is 1.
    - `y2` is `r[5] - a`.
    - `c` is equal to `y2 - 1`.
13. Otherwise:
    - `y1` is `m`.
    - `y2` is `r[5] + a`.
    - `c` is equal to `m - y2`.
14. The current value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`.
15. The current value of `abs(x2 - c)` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`.
16. `y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive.
17. `x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.

### Analysis:
- The `print('bob')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'bob'`.
- The initial state and conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described.

### Conclusion:
The `print('bob')` statement will print the string `'bob'`.

Output: **bob**
