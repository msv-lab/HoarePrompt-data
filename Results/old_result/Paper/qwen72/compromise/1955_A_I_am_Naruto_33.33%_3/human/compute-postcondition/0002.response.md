The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might accept or use some form of input or context that includes an integer `t` and, for each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Given these constraints, the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30) and returns a result based on the values of these parameters.**
