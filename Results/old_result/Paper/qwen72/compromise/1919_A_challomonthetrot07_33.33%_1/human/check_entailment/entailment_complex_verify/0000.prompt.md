You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:

        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 \le a, b \le 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:

        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, the function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' according to the following rules: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` equals 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` equals 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The values of `a` and `b` are not retained between iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the coin counts and the relative values of `a` and `b` is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

- **Input**: `a = 2`, `b = 3`
- **Expected Output**: `Bob`
- **Actual Output**: `Alice`

In this case, Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 3 coins. According to the problem description, if both players play optimally, Bob should win. However, the program incorrectly outputs `Alice`.

Let's break down the optimal play for this case:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 3 coins.
2. Alice can choose to swap or not swap. If she swaps, the state becomes `a = 3` and `b = 2`.
3. Bob then has to remove a coin, leaving `a = 3` and `b = 1`.
4. Alice can now swap again, leaving `a = 1` and `b = 3`.
5. Bob removes a coin, leaving `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
6. Alice removes a coin, leaving `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
7. Bob cannot swap with Alice (since Alice's wallet is empty) and must remove a coin, leaving `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
8. Alice cannot make a move (since her wallet is empty), so Bob wins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `Alice` because it does not correctly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are greater than 1 and have different parities. The logic should be more sophisticated to handle all possible scenarios.
