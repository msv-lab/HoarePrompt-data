You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 \le a, b \le 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions are not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
