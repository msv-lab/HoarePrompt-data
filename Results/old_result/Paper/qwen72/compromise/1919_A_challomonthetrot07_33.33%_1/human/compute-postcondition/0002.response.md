Output State: **The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are overwritten in each iteration.**
