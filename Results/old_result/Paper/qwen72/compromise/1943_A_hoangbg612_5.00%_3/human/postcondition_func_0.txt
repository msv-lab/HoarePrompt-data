The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `S` and a list of `S` integers. It sorts the list and then constructs a dictionary `M` where each key is an integer from the list that is exactly one more than the previous integer, and the value is the count of consecutive integers equal to the key. The function then determines the smallest index `cur` such that the count of integers up to `cur` in `M` is less than or equal to `cur`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the largest integer in the list plus one. The function prints `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
