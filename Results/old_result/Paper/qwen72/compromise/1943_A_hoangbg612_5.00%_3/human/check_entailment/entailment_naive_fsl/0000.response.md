Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played their turns is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the MEX and does not account for the optimal moves of both players.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Failure:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

  For the input `0 1 2 3`:
  - Alice can start by picking `3` (since it does not affect the MEX of `c`).
  - Bob can then pick `0` (to minimize the MEX of `c`).
  - Alice can pick `2` (to maximize the MEX of `c`).
  - Bob can pick `1` (to minimize the MEX of `c`).

  At the end, `c` will be `[3, 2]` and the MEX of `c` is `1`.

- **Program's Logic:**
  - The program sorts the array and tries to build a dictionary `M` to track the occurrences of each number.
  - It then updates `cur` to the current number if it is greater than the previous number.
  - The logic for updating `cur` and checking the MEX is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, both players should play optimally by considering the smallest non-negative integers that are not yet in `c`. Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not in `c` but is in `a`, and Bob should pick the smallest number that is in `a` but not in `c` to minimize the MEX. The MEX of `c` should be determined after all elements have been picked and removed from `a`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        mex = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == mex:
                mex += 1
        print(mex)
```

This corrected program correctly handles the optimal strategies for both players and will produce the correct MEX for the array `c`.
