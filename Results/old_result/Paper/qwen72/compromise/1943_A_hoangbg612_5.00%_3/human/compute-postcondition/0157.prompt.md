Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` is set to the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, incremented by 1. If the loop breaks, `cur` is set to the first integer `i` where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any) where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key. `cur` is the smallest index `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` remains unchanged and is equal to its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
