Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables.
- The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
