Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key. `cur` is the last integer in `N` or the highest integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`T`**: Remains greater than 1.
- **`_`**: Remains 2.
- **`S`**: Remains the input integer provided by the user.
- **`N`**: Remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- **`M`**: Becomes a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list. The value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key.
- **`cur`**: After the loop finishes, `cur` is the last integer in `N` or the highest integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list. If the loop breaks early because `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` will be the last integer that was processed before the break.

### Example:
If `N` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5]`:
- After the loop, `M` will be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 3}`.
- `cur` will be `5` because it is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list. The loop breaks when it encounters the second `5` because `5` is not greater than `4` (which is `cur + 1`).

If `N` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- After the loop, `M` will be `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`.
- `cur` will be `4` because it is the last integer in `N`.

If `N` is `[1, 3, 3, 3]`:
- After the loop, `M` will be `{1: 1, 3: 3}`.
- `cur` will be `3` because the loop breaks when it encounters the second `3` (since `3` is not greater than `2`).

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
