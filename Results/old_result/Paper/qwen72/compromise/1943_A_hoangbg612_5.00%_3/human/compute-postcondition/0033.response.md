Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and if `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `M` is updated with the new value of `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num` <= `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.***
