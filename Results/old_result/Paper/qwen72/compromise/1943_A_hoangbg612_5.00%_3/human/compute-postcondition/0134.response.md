Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is equal to `num`.** 

The value of `cur` is now equal to the value of `num`. The conditions for determining the value of `cur` (whether `num` > `cur` + 1, or incrementing `cur` by 2 and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement) are no longer relevant as `cur` has been directly assigned the value of `num`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
