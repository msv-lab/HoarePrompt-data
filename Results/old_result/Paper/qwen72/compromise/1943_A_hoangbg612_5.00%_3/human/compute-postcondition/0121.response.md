Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is -1 or the first element in `N`, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, `cur` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is greater than -1. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is set to 0 and `num` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 0, `cur` remains -1, and `num` is less than or equal to -1.***
