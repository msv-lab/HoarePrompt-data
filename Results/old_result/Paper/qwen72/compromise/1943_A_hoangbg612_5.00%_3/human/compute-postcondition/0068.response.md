Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Since `cur` is -1, the value of `M[-1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
