Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is updated to `cur` + 1, `num` remains the second element in `N`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all variables retain their original values.***
