Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cur` has not been set yet.**

The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `N` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The initial state of `N` being a sorted list of integers is no longer valid, but the new `N` is now a list of integers as provided by the user. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `M`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
