Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `N`. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.***
