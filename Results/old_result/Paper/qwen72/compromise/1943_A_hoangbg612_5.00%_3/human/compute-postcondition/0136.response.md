Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is the second element in `N` if `num` > `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 1, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `T` remains greater than 1, `_` remains 2, `S` remains an input integer, `N` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 3 elements, `num` remains the third element in `N`, and `cur` remains the second element in `N` if `num` is greater than `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 1. The dictionary `M` has the key `cur` incremented by 1.
