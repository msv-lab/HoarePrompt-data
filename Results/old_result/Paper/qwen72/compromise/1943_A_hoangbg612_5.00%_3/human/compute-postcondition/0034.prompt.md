Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > -1, `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` > `cur` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` <= -1, `cur` remains -1, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` (-1) as a key and its value incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, if `num` > -1, `cur` remains the first element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value incremented by 1. If `num` <= -1, `cur` remains -1, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` (-1) as a key and its value incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is updated based on the conditions in the loop body, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and if `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `M` is updated with the new value of `cur`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num` <= `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
