Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`, and the current value of `num` is greater than -1. Additionally, the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, which means `num` is greater than 0.**
