The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cur` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `cur` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `cur` must be greater than 1.**
