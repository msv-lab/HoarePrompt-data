Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key. `cur` is the last integer in `N` or the highest integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list. The sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`.**
