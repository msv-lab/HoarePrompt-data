The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is designed to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it processes two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the results for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. 

Since the exact output is not specified, we can only infer that the function processes these test cases and returns some result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, it processes two integers `a` and `b` between 1 and 10^9. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
