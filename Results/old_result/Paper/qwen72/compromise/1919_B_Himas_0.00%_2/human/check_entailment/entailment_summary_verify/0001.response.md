Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to split a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` for the number of '+' characters and `M` for the number of '-' characters.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for '+' and `M` for '-'.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `P - M`.
   - This difference does not directly correspond to the minimum possible penalty.
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of the entire array is zero, the optimal split is to keep it as one subarray, resulting in a penalty of zero.
   - If the sum is non-zero, the optimal split is to split the array into subarrays of length 1, each contributing a penalty of 1 (since the absolute value of the sum of a single element is 1 and the length is 1).

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - If the sum is zero, the minimum penalty is zero.
   - If the sum is non-zero, the minimum penalty is the length of the array (since each element will be in its own subarray).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum penalty.
   - The correct solution should calculate the sum of the array and determine the penalty based on whether the sum is zero or non-zero.

Given the function summary and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty.

Final: **False**
