Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty based on the sum of these subarrays.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` or `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, both of which result in a total penalty of `0`. However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3 - 3 = 0`, and then incorrectly prints `0` instead of the minimum penalty.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle the splitting and penalty calculation as required by the problem description, making it incorrect.
