Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string s (s_i ∈ { '+', '-' }, |s| = n) representing the length and content of the string for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the parameters as described in the precondition. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def min_penalty(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `s` for each test case.
