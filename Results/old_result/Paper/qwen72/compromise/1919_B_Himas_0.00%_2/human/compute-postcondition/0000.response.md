The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop depends on the input value to `range`. For the loop to execute, the input value to `range` must be greater than 0. The state provided describes the function parameters, but the loop itself is not directly dependent on these parameters. Instead, it depends on the user input, which is converted to an integer.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. The initial state does not need to specify the values of `t` or the list of tuples since they are not involved in the loop head. However, the input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`i` is 0, the input value must be greater than 0**
