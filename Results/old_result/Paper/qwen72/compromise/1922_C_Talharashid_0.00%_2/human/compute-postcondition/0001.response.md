The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the loop variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the initial value for the range function. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
