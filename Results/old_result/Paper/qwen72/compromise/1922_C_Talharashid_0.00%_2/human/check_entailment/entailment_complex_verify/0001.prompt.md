You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative minimum differences for each index when traversing the list `lst` from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each of the `m` queries, the minimum of the two possible cumulative differences (one from `d1` and one from `d2`) is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of strictly increasing integers and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum cumulative difference between the specified indices, considering both forward and backward traversals of the list. The function reads the number of test cases, the list of integers, and the queries from standard input. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function terminates with the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` unchanged, and the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` populated with the cumulative differences for each index.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `lst`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in both directions (from left to right and from right to left).
   - It uses two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the list of cities and calculates the minimum distance to the next or previous city.
   - It updates the cumulative cost `s` and stores it in the respective dictionary (`d1` or `d2`).

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the start and end cities, adjusts the indices to be 0-based, and calculates the minimum cost to travel from the start city to the end city.
   - It considers two possible paths: one using the cumulative costs stored in `d1` and the other using the cumulative costs stored in `d2`.
   - It prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the start and end cities are the same by ensuring `start != end` in the while loops.
   - It also handles the case where the start city is greater than the end city by swapping the roles of `d1` and `d2`.

6. **Algorithmic Correctness**:
   - The approach of using cumulative costs to determine the minimum travel cost is generally correct.
   - However, the program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the minimum distance to the closest city. It should only consider the immediate neighbors (i.e., `lst[start + 1]` and `lst[start - 1]`), but it incorrectly initializes `mini` to a large value and then updates it without considering the uniqueness of the closest city.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program has a time complexity of O(n) for each test case to calculate the cumulative costs, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The query handling is also efficient with a time complexity of O(1) per query.

8. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The main issue is in the calculation of the closest city. The program should directly use the immediate neighbors to determine the closest city, as the cities are guaranteed to be in ascending order and the closest city is unique.
   - The current implementation can lead to incorrect results if the distances to the neighbors are not correctly handled.

Given the logical flaw in the closest city calculation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
