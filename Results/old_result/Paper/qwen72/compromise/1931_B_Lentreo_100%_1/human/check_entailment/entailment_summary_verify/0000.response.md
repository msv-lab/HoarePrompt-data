**Reasoning**:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the operation of pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.
   - The sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means the mean value is an integer.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean value of the list `nums`.
   - It then iterates through the list, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` from the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Critical Flaw**:
   - The key issue is that the program only checks if the cumulative difference from the mean is non-negative. This is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one.
   - The program does not account for the requirement that water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container. This means that even if the cumulative difference is non-negative, it might still be impossible to achieve the desired equal distribution due to the constraints on the pouring operation.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     n = 3
     nums = [1, 2, 3]
     ```
   - The total sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is divisible by `3`.
   - The mean is `6 // 3 = 2`.
   - The program will output:
     ```
     YES
     ```
   - However, it is impossible to make all containers have 2 units of water using the allowed operations. The only way to achieve this would be to pour 1 unit from the third container to the first, but this is not allowed because the operation must be from a lower index to a higher index.

5. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the directional constraint of the pouring operation.
   - The cumulative difference check is insufficient to determine the feasibility of the operations.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the directional constraint of the pouring operation, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
