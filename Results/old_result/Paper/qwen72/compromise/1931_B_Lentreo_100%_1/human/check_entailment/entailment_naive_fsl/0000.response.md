Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation**:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` but the distribution of water cannot be made equal by the allowed operations. Specifically, the program checks if the cumulative difference from the mean is ever negative, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem.

**Counterexample**:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 3
nums = [1, 2, 3]
```
- The total sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is divisible by `3`.
- The mean is `6 // 3 = 2`.

The program will output:
```
YES
```
However, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water (2 units each) using the allowed operations (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). The only way to achieve this would be to pour 1 unit from the third container to the first, but this is not allowed because the operation must be from a lower index to a higher index.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
