Output State: **`curr` is 0, `nums` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `total` is unchanged, `mean` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list.
- In each iteration, `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `nums[i]` and the mean of the list `mean`.
- Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list (`n`), the mean is an integer.
- Over the entire loop, the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is zero because the sum of `nums[i]` is `total`, and the sum of `mean` over `n` iterations is `n * mean`, which is equal to `total`.
- Therefore, `curr` will be 0 after the loop completes.
- The variables `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
