You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that it should be called with multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers must satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, the sum of h over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.

    #State: The loop will execute the specified number of times, processing each set of six integers (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) and printing either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob" based on the conditions provided. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be updated with each iteration to reflect the next set of input values, but their final values will be the last set of inputs processed by the loop. The loop counter `i` will have the value equal to the number of test cases minus one after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)` respectively.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - If `xa > xb`, it means Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and neither can move to the other's position. This results in a draw, as Alice cannot move down and Bob cannot move up.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The variable `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. This represents the number of moves it would take for both players to potentially meet if they move optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the distance between `xa` and `xb` is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), Alice and Bob will not meet on the same row after an equal number of moves. The function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice's chip can potentially be after `x` moves.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if Alice's chip can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x + 1` moves. If this condition is true, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

5. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the distance between `xa` and `xb` is even, Alice and Bob will meet on the same row after an equal number of moves. The function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob's chip can potentially be after `x` moves.
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if Bob's chip can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x` moves. If this condition is true, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if xa > xb` correctly identifies a draw when Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip. This is because Alice cannot move down and Bob cannot move up, so they cannot meet.

- **Distance Calculation:**
  - The calculation `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` is correct for determining the number of moves it would take for both players to potentially meet.

- **Odd Distance Case:**
  - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice's chip is correct.
  - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is intended to check if Alice can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x + 1` moves. However, this condition is incorrect because it should check if Alice can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x` moves, not `x + 1`.

- **Even Distance Case:**
  - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Bob's chip is incorrect. It should be `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
  - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is incorrect because it should check if Bob can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x` moves, not `x` moves from `yb`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, ya + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[l <= yb <= r])
            else:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[l <= ya <= r])
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the conditions for determining the winner.
- The corrected program correctly checks if Alice or Bob can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in the appropriate number of moves.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
