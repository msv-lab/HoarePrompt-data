Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential game scenarios. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

In this case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3). Alice can move to (3, 2) or (3, 3) on her first turn. If Alice moves to (3, 3), Bob can move to (4, 3) on his turn. Alice can then move to (4, 3) on her next turn, capturing Bob's chip and winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case.
