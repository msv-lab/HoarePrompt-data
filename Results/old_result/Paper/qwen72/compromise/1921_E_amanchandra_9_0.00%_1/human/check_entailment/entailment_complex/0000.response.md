### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function checks if `x_a` is greater than `x_b`. If `x_a > x_b`, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b` and divides it by 2 to get `x`. This is the number of moves required for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance between `x_a` and `x_b` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible `y` positions where Alice can move to meet Bob.
   - It then checks if Alice's `y` position (`y_a`) is within this range and prints "Alice" if it is, otherwise "Draw".

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance between `x_a` and `x_b` is even, the function calculates the range of possible `y` positions where Bob can move to meet Alice.
   - It then checks if Bob's `y` position (`y_b`) is within this range and prints "Bob" if it is, otherwise "Draw".

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case as required.

### Issues:
- **Logical Error in Even Distance Case**:
  - The logic for the even distance case is incorrect. The function should check if Alice's `y` position (`y_a`) is within the range where Bob can potentially meet her, not Bob's `y` position (`y_b`).

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - ya) <= x and abs(r - ya) <= x])
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has a logical error in the even distance case where it incorrectly checks Bob's `y` position instead of Alice's `y` position.

### Corrected Reasoning:
- The corrected program correctly checks if Alice's `y` position is within the range where Bob can potentially meet her in the even distance case. This ensures that the program accurately determines the outcome of the game based on the problem description.
