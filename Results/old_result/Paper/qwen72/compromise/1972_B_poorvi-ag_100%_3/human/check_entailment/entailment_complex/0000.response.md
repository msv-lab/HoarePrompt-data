### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial state of the coins `arr`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The function checks if the count of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `arr` is odd.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it appends 'no' to the `results` list, indicating that Bob will win.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the `results` list to the console.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Odd Count of 'U':**
  - If the count of 'U' is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no valid moves left. This is because each move reduces the count of 'U' by one, and an odd count will eventually become zero (an even count) after an odd number of moves, leaving Bob with no moves.
  
- **Even Count of 'U':**
  - If the count of 'U' is even, Bob will always have a move available when it is his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no valid moves left. This is because each move reduces the count of 'U' by one, and an even count will eventually become zero (an even count) after an even number of moves, leaving Alice with no moves.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Coin:**
  - If there is only one coin and it is 'U', Alice will win immediately.
  - If there is only one coin and it is 'D', Alice will lose immediately.
  
- **Two Coins:**
  - If there are two coins and both are 'U', Alice will remove one coin, and Bob will be left with the other coin, which will be 'U'. Bob will then remove the last coin, and Alice will lose.
  - If there are two coins and one is 'U' and the other is 'D', Alice will remove the 'U' coin, and Bob will be left with the 'D' coin, which cannot be flipped. Bob will lose.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the function is correct based on the problem description. The function correctly determines the winner by checking the parity of the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
