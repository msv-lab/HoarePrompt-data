Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for that test case is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The loop prints each element in the `results` list, one by one, to the console.
