The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, the list `results` must contain at least one element. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted. 

Given the state before the loop starts, the `results` list should contain at least one 'yes' or 'no' for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in the `results` list during the first iteration.

State: **`results` is a list that must contain at least one 'yes' or 'no', `i` is the first element in the `results` list, `t` remains unchanged**
