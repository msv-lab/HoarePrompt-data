Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`.
   - `r` is a new input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
   - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` is determined based on the value of `r` and possibly `r2`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2.
     - Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
     - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values for `prev`:**
   - `prev` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions described.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string with the format `'? 3 3 {prev} {prev}'`.
   - The value of `prev` will depend on the input string `r` and possibly `r2`.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? 3 3 {prev} {prev} (where {prev} is 0, 1, or 2 based on the input string `r` and possibly `r2`)**
