Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a string input, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is flushed to the console or output stream. However, since the output buffer was already flushed in the initial state, this function call does not change any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
