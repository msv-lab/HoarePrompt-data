Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is a new input string.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string.
   - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n-1`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 3, `v1` will be `n-1`, which is an integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is 1.
     - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values of `prev`:**
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2.
   - If `r` is '=', and `r2` is not '<', `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` is 0.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will format the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.
   - `v1` is `n-1`, which is an integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `prev` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the value of `r` and `r2`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] [prev] (where [n-1] is the value of `v1` which is `n-1` and [prev] is 0, 1, or 2 based on the value of `r` and `r2`)**
