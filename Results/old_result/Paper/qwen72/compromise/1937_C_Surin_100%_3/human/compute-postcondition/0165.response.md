Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `v2` is 3.
- `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
- If `r` is '<', `prev` is set to 0. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

The print statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The print statement is using an f-string to format the output.
2. The values of the variables `v1` and `v2` are explicitly given:
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `v2` is 3.
3. The f-string will substitute these values into the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
? 1 1 3 3
```

Output: **? 1 1 3 3**
