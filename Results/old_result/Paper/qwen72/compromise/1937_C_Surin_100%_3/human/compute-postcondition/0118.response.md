Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `r` is a new input string.
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1.
   - If `r` is '=', `r2` is a new input string.
   - If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 2, `v1` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is determined based on the value of `r` and potentially `r2`:
     - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
     - If `r` is '=', `r2` is read, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

4. **Possible Values for `prev`:**
   - If `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is anything else, or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is anything other than '<', `prev` is 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `'? v1 i v1 prev'`.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions described.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [n-1] 2 [n-1] [prev] (where [n-1] is the value of `n - 1` and [prev] is 1 if `r` is '>' or if `r` is '=' and `r2` is '<', otherwise [prev] is 0)**
