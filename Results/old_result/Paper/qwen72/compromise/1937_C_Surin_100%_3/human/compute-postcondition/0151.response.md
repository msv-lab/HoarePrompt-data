The provided code snippet only includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function flushes the output buffer, which means any buffered data is written to the output immediately. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `n-1`. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, if `r` is '>', `prev` is set to the last `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if `r` was never '>'. If `r` is neither '>', nor '=', `prev` remains 0.**
