To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The loop initializes `i` to 1 and iterates up to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 to `n-1`).
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is given as `n-1`. This is incorrect because the loop expects `i` to start at 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to 1.

2. **Variable `n`**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n-1` if `n > 1`).
   - The state before the loop states that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:

- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables and objects (`R`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`, and the output buffer) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:

State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the last input string, `prev` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
