Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 1. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` only flushes the output buffer, which was already mentioned in the initial state as being flushed. No other variables or conditions are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
