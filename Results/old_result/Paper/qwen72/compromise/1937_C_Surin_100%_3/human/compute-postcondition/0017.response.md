The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program's state in terms of variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '<', then the variables retain their initial values.**
