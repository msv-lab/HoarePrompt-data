The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `r` was '<' during the loop, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is a string input, the output buffer has been flushed, and if `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is a string input, and if `r2` is '<', `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.**
