Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which `r` was '>' or `r` and `r2` were '=' and '<' respectively, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The code `r = input('')` updates the variable `r` to the new input string provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
