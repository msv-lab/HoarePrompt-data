Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. `kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2. If `r` is '=', `r2` is the new input string. If `r2` is '<', `prev` is set to 2. If `r2` is not '<', `prev` remains 0. If `r` is not '>', and not '=', `prev` remains 0.**
