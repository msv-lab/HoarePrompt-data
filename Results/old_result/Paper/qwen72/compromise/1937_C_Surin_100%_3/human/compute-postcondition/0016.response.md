Based on the initial state provided:

- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer.
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `v2` is 2.
- `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.
- If `r` is '<', then the variables retain their initial values.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values of the variables used in the print statement:
- `v1` is 1.
- `v2` is 2.

The print statement will format and print the string `'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'` using the values of `v1` and `v2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
