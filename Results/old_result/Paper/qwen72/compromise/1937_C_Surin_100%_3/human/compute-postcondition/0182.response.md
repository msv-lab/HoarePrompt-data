Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is 0, `r2` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The value of `r2` is now the new input string, while the value of `r` remains the new input string. All other variables retain their initial values.
