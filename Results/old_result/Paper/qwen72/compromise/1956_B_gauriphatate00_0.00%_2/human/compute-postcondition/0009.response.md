To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will only execute if `results` is not empty. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains `result` and `results`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `results` contains at least one element.
3. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**: We need to ensure that `results` is not empty.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop
- `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input
- `idx` is the index after the last element of the last processed list `a`
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `results` is not empty. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop, `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is the index after the last element of the last processed list `a`, `results` must contain at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`**
