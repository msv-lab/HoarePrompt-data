### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to determine the maximum number of points you can get in a single game.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) where an integer appears exactly twice.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for pairs that you have, and you can only play up to `n // 2` turns (since you and Nene each take `n` turns, and you can only score points on your turns).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the value of `n` and the list `a` of integers.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read in a single line and split into a list of strings.
   - The first element of this list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the function reads `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The function correctly processes the input and ensures that all test cases are handled.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.
   - Nene's optimal play is implicitly handled by the function's logic, as it only considers the pairs you can form, and Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when there are no pairs in your hand.
   - The function ensures that the number of pairs you can form is limited by `n // 2`, which is the maximum number of turns you can take.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the card game, considering Nene's optimal play. Both functions work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
