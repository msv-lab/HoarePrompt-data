You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each test case, and these results have been printed to the standard output. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged after the function concludes.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It counts the number of pairs of cards you have using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It then calculates the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` to determine the maximum number of points you can get. This is because you can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table, and you can only place up to `n // 2` cards in your turns.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
- It correctly handles the case where you have no pairs of cards.
- It correctly handles the case where you have all pairs of cards.

Since the program meets all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description, it is correct.
