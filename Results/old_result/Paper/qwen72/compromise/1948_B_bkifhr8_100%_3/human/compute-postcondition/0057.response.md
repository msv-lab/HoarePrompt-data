Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, otherwise `ans` is False.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 0 but is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- `_` is still a placeholder and is not affected by the loop.
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, and its elements may have been modified during the loop execution.
- `i` is 1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates backward from `m - 1` to 1.
- `ans` is True if the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists. If at any point `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and the loop breaks.
