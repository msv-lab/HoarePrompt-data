Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` creates a new list `nums`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is converted to a string, and each character of this string is converted to an integer, forming a list of digits.
- This list of digits is then concatenated with a list containing the single element `arr[i]`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
