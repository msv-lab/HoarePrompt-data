Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True if `nums` is sorted, otherwise `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.***
