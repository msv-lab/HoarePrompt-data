Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`.***
