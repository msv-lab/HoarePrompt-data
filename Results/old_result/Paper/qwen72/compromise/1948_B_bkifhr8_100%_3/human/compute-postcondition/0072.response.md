The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`, and `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `i` will be `m - 2` and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is True**
