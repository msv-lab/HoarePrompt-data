Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to `False`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition `if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent logic for updating `nums` and `arr[i - 1]` are not executed because the code snippet only contains the assignment `ans = False`.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `ans`.
