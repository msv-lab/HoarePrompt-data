Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking for all iterations, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted in any of the iterations.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` is 0**: The loop has completed all its iterations, so `n` has been decremented to 0.
- **`_` is a placeholder**: The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop and does not affect the state.
- **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2**: For each test case, `m` represents the length of the array `arr`, and it must be at least 2 for the loop to run.
- **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user**: `arr` is the list of integers provided by the user for each test case.
- **`i` is 1**: The inner loop variable `i` is reset to 1 for each test case, but it is not relevant to the final state after all iterations.
- **`ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking for all iterations, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted in any of the iterations**: `ans` is a boolean that indicates whether it was possible to sort the array `arr` in non-decreasing order by splitting elements that are at least 10. If any test case fails to meet the sorting condition, `ans` will be set to False and the loop will break for that test case. If all test cases pass, `ans` will remain True.
