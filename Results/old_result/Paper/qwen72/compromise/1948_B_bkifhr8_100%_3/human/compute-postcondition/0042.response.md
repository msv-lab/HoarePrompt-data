Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the first element of `arr` followed by the second element of `arr`, `arr[0]` is now `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted; otherwise, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, the variables retain their initial values.**
