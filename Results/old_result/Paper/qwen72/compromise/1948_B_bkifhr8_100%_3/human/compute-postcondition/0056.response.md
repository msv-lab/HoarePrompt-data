Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `nums` and `ans` retain their values from the previous iteration. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration if `nums` is sorted. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
