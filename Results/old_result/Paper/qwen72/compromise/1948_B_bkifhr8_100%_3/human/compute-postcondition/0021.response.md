The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `m - 3`, and `m` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is within the valid range (i.e., `i` must be greater than 0).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted. Otherwise, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.**
