The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func_2` is set up to read input from `stdin` using the `input` variable, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
