The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The state of `result` is determined by the elements in `results` and will be the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains the same as its initial value.
- `idx` is now `1 + t + sum(n for n in map(int, data[1:1+t]))`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `results` is non-empty.

State: **`t` remains the same as its initial value, `idx` is now `1 + t + sum(n for n in map(int, data[1:1+t]))`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
