Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - **Input**: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on the cards in your hand).
   - **Process**:
     - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
     - It calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) in your hand.
     - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` (the maximum number of pairs you can play optimally).
   - **Output**: The maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - **Input**: Reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - **Process**:
     - Splits the input data into a list of strings.
     - Iterates over the test cases.
     - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` and the list of integers `a`.
     - Calls `func_1` with the extracted values and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, but the number of pairs in your hand limits the maximum points you can get. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading all input data at once and processing each test case individually.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
