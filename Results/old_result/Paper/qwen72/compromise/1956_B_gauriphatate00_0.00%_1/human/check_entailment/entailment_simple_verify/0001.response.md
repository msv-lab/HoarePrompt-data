### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy:**
   - You and Nene take turns, and each turn involves placing one card on the table.
   - If a card with the same integer is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally, meaning she will always try to score a point if possible and, if not, will try to prevent you from scoring a point in the future.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand.
   - If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can score a point for one of them (the first one you play will not score a point, but the second one will if Nene hasn't played the matching card yet).
   - Nene will always play optimally, so she will try to score points for herself and prevent you from scoring points.

4. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n, a)` calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then sums the number of integers that appear exactly twice (i.e., pairs).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can only score points for up to half of the total number of turns you have.

5. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the result for each test case.

### Validation Using Annotated Code

- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
  - `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times.
  - The function `func_1` correctly uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
  - It then sums the number of integers that appear exactly twice (i.e., pairs).
  - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which is the correct logic for determining the maximum number of points you can score.

- **State Before `func_2` Call:**
  - No variables are passed to the function `func_2`.
  - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
  - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for each test case and appends the result to a list.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given that Nene plays optimally. The annotated code confirms that the state and behavior of the program align with the problem description and the intended solution.

Final: **True**
