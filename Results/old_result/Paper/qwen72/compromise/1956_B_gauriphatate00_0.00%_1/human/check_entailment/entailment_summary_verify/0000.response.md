### Reasoning:

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Correctness**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking turns optimally. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- **Logic**:
  - **Counting Pairs**: The function correctly counts the number of pairs of cards you have by summing up the instances where a card appears exactly twice.
  - **Optimal Play**: The function then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is correct because:
    - You can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table.
    - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
    - The maximum number of points you can get is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you can play (which is `n // 2`).

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Input Parsing**:
  - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent values for each test case.
- **Test Case Processing**:
  - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input data.
  - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
- **Output**:
  - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list to the standard output.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The function `func_2` correctly handles a single test case by reading the input and processing it.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and processing each one.
- **Empty Hand**: If you have no pairs in your hand, the function `func_1` correctly returns 0.
- **All Pairs**: If you have all pairs in your hand, the function `func_1` correctly returns the number of pairs, which is `n // 2`.

#### Verification:
- **Function 1**: The logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem description. It correctly identifies the pairs and limits the score based on the number of turns.
- **Function 2**: The input parsing and test case processing in `func_2` are efficient and correct. The function correctly calls `func_1` and prints the results.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and handle all edge cases as described in the problem. The program follows the problem constraints and produces the correct output for each test case.

Final: **True**
