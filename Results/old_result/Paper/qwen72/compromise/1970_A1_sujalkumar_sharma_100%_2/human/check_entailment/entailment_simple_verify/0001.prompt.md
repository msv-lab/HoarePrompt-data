You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance value, the index `i`, and the character at index `i` of the string `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string formed by concatenating the third elements of the tuples in `prefix_balance`, which is sorted by the balance value in ascending order, and for tuples with the same balance value, by the index in descending order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a standard and correct way to handle input strings in Python.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples containing the balance, position, and character for each position in the input string. It also initializes a `balance` variable to keep track of the current balance as it iterates through the string.

3. **Balance Update**: For each character in the string, the program appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the `prefix_balance` list. If the character is '(', the balance is incremented by 1; if the character is ')', the balance is decremented by 1. This correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to the current character.

4. **Sorting the Prefix Balance List**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means the list is sorted first by the balance in ascending order, and then by the position in descending order. This sorting order is correct according to the problem description.

5. **Constructing the Result**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This is done using a list comprehension to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and then joining them into a single string.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of the `func_1` function, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

The program follows the problem description accurately and performs the required operations correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
