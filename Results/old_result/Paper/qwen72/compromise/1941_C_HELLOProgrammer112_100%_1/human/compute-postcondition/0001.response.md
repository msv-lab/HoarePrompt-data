Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each test case, it will print the value of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in `s`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be recalculated for each test case, and the final output will be the sum of `x + y - z` for each test case. The variables `a` and `s` will be updated for each test case, but the overall state of the function will remain the same as the initial state, except for the printed output.**
