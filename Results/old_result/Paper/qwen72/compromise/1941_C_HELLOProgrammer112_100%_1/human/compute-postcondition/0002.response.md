The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The constraint for `n` is 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the input tuple (n, s).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the input tuple (n, s) for each test case.**
