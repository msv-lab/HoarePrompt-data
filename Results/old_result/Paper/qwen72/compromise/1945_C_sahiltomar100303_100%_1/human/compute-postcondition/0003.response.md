Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side of the road, and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints.**
