Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where multiple test cases are provided. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side of the road, and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function should handle these inputs internally and is expected to be called in a loop or similar structure to process each test case. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is the number of test cases, which is an integer provided by the user.**
