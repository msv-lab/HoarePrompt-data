Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. `ans` is increased by `i`.** 

In natural language: The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the first element in the list `tmp`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
