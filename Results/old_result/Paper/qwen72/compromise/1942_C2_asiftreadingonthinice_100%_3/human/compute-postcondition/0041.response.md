The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tmp`. If `tmp` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `tmp`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `tmp`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tmp` must have at least one more element, and `i` will be the second element in `tmp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` must have at least 2 elements**
