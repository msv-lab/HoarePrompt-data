Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.***
