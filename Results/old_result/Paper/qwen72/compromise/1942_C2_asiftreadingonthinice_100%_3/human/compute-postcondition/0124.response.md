Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even, `tmp` contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, if the difference between the first and second elements in `a` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even, `tmp` remains an empty list, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even.***
