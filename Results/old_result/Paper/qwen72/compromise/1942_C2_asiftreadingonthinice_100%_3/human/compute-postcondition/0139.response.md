Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. Otherwise, if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 != 0`, then `ans` remains `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` does not include the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
