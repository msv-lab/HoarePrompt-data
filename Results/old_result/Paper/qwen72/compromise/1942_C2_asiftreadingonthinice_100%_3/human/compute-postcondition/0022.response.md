Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 1` or `x + y - 2` depending on the conditions described, `tmp` is a list that contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
