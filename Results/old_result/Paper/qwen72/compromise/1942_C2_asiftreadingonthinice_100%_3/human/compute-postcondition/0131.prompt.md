Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is now a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not even, otherwise `tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, if the difference between the first and second elements in `a` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even, otherwise `tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` plus 1. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even, otherwise `tmp` contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, and `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1, and `tmp` remains as previously defined based on the conditions involving the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` now includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as previously defined, and `ans` remains as previously defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
