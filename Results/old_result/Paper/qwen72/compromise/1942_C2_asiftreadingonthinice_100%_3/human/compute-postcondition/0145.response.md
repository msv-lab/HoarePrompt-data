Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is the first element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, `tmp` must have at least one element, and `y` is less than `i - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
