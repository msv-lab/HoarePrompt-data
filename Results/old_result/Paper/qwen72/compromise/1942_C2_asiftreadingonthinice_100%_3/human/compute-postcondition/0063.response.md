Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
