Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to properly check if there exists a template that both `a` and `b` match, while `c` does not. The program only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

The program will output:
```
YES
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
```

In this case, there is no template that both `a` and `b` can match while `c` does not. The program incorrectly assumes that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for all `i`, then a valid template exists. This is not always true, as `a` and `b` must also match the same template.
