Let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than `n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings.
- `l` is initially 'NO'.
- If any character in `a` or `b` at position `i` (for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`) is not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t` is a value greater than `n`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings.
   - `l` is a string that can be either 'NO' or 'YES'.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition checks if any character in `a` or `b` at position `i` (for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`) is not equal to the corresponding character in `c`.
   - If this condition is true for any `i`, `l` is set to 'YES'.
   - If this condition is false for all `i`, `l` remains 'NO'.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(l)` statement will output the value of `l` after the condition check.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is set to `n` and the condition check is performed for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the condition check will not include the position `i = n` because `n` is outside the range (0 to `n-1`).
- Therefore, the condition check will only consider positions from 0 to `n-1`.

- If any character in `a` or `b` at position `i` (for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`) is not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, `l` will be set to 'YES'.
- If all characters in `a` and `b` at positions from 0 to `n-1` are equal to the corresponding characters in `c`, `l` will remain 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(l)` statement will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the condition check. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if any character in `a` or `b` at position `i` (for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`) is not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, otherwise l is 'NO')**
