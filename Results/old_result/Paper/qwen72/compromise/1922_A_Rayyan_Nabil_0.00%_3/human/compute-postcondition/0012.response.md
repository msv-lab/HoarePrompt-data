Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string, `l` is 'YES'.**

The variable `l` is set to 'YES'. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still valid. The condition that `l` is 'YES' is now explicitly true, regardless of the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
