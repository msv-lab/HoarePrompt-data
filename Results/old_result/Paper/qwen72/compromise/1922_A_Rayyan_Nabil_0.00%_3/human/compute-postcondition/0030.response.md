Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.***
