Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string.
- `c` is a new input string.
- If any character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(l)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer. This means `i` is the last index of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` if they are of length `n`.

2. **Check the condition for `l`**:
   - The condition states that if the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is set to 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.

3. **Determine the value of `l`**:
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `l` without knowing the strings.
   - However, based on the condition, `l` will be 'YES' if the characters at the last index of `a` and `b` are both different from the character at the last index of `c`.
   - If either the character at the last index of `a` or `b` matches the character at the last index of `c`, `l` will be 'NO'.

### Final Output:
The `print(l)` statement will print the value of `l` based on the condition described. Since the exact strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if the character at index `n-1` in `a` and `b` are both different from the character at index `n-1` in `c`, and 'NO' otherwise)**
