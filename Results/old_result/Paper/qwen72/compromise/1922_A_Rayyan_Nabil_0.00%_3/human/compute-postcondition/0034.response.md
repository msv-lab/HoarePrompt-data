Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If any character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` has reached `n-1`, meaning the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer, unchanged.
- The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as the input strings, unchanged.
- The variable `l` will be 'YES' if at any index `i` in the loop, the character in `a` at that index is not equal to the character in `c` at that index, and the character in `b` at that index is also not equal to the character in `c` at that index. Otherwise, `l` will remain 'NO'.
