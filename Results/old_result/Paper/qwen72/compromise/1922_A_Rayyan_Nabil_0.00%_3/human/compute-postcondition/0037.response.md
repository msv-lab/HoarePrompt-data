Output State: **`t` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `l` is 'NO' or 'YES' based on the previous iteration's condition.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer, but the other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is greater than `n` is still valid, and `i` is still equal to `n` (now the new value of `n`). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still new input strings, and `l` retains its value of 'NO' or 'YES' based on the previous iteration's condition.
