The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than `n`, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.**
