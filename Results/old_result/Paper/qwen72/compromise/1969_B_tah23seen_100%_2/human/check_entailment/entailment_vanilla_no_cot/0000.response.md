Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on a flawed logic. Specifically, it adds the number of '1's seen so far plus one to the cost whenever it encounters a '0' after seeing at least one '1'. This approach does not account for the optimal way to cyclically shift substrings to sort the binary string.

### Explanation of the Flaw:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost of sorting the string. For example, for the string `101011`, the program will output `5`, but the correct minimum cost is `3` (by shifting the substring `101` to `110` and then the substring `1101` to `1110`).

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts is to find the minimum number of contiguous segments of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string. The cost for each segment is the length of the segment plus one (for the cyclic shift).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Identify the segments of '1's in the string.
- Calculate the cost to move each segment to the end of the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    t -= 1

def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    segments = 0
    current_segment_length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_segment_length += 1
        else:
            if current_segment_length > 0:
                segments += 1
                cost += current_segment_length + 1
            current_segment_length = 0
    if current_segment_length > 0:
        segments += 1
        cost += current_segment_length + 1
    return cost - segments

# Explanation:
# - `segments` counts the number of segments of '1's.
# - `current_segment_length` keeps track of the length of the current segment of '1's.
# - For each segment of '1's, the cost is the length of the segment plus one.
# - We subtract the number of segments from the total cost because the last segment does not need an additional +1 cost.
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
