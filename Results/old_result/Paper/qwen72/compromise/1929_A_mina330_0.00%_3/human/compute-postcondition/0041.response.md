The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each integer in the inner list has the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the elements of the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `a`, where each inner list contains integers representing the elements of the array for each test case. It returns the result of processing each test case based on the elements of the array.**
