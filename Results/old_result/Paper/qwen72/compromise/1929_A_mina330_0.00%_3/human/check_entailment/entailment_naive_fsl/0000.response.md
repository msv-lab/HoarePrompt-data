Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the length of the array `n` is even. The problem description specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the program only sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements for the first half of the sorted array. This approach does not always yield the maximum beauty, especially when `n` is even.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program will calculate the beauty as:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4
```
However, the correct maximum beauty should be:
```
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4
```
But if we rearrange the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, the beauty is:
```
(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2
```
The program does not consider this rearrangement, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which will always yield the maximum beauty. The correct approach would be:
```
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += a[i] - a[i-1]
        print(kq)
```
