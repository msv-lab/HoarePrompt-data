Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is either True or unchanged. If the loop finds any index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and the loop breaks, printing 2. If no such index is found, the loop completes all iterations, and `flag` remains unchanged, printing 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `x` is a new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `x - 1`, and `flag` is either True or unchanged. If the loop did not break, the `else` block is executed, and 3 is printed. If the loop broke, 2 is printed and `flag` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `x` is a new input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `x - 1`, and `flag` is either True or unchanged. If the loop did not break, `flag` remains unchanged and the loop prints 3. If the loop broke, `flag` is True and the loop printed 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
