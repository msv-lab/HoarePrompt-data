Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is either True or unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
