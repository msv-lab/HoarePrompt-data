The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the constant value `2`.

Output: **2**
