Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all input cases. Here's why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` to determine if a friend and their best friend are the same. However, this condition is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party, and the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` does not help in achieving that goal.

2. **Incorrect Output**: The program always prints either 2 or 3, which is not necessarily the correct minimum number of invitations for all cases. For example, in the second test case provided in the problem, the correct answer is 3, but the program might incorrectly print 2 if it finds a pair that satisfies the flawed condition.

3. **Missing Algorithm**: The program lacks the necessary algorithm to determine the minimum number of invitations. It should identify the smallest set of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves finding connected components in the graph formed by the friends and their best friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a set of pairs (i, p[i])
        pairs = set((i + 1, p[i]) for i in range(n))
        
        # Initialize the minimum number of invitations to n
        min_invitations = n
        
        # Check all possible pairs of friends
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if (i, j) in pairs and (j, i) in pairs:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
                else:
                    # Check if inviting i and j's best friend works
                    if (i, p[j - 1]) in pairs and (p[j - 1], i) in pairs:
                        min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 3)
                    # Check if inviting j and i's best friend works
                    if (j, p[i - 1]) in pairs and (p[i - 1], j) in pairs:
                        min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 3)
        
        print(min_invitations)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed by checking all possible pairs and their best friends. However, it can be optimized further for larger inputs. For the given constraints, this approach should work, but a more efficient solution would involve graph traversal techniques to find connected components.
