You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the list `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times a unique integer appears in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4. This means the function calculates how many complete sets of 4 sticks can be formed for each unique stick length and returns the total number of such sets.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided is incorrect because it only considers the possibility of forming squares (4-sided polygons) and does not account for the formation of other regular polygons with different numbers of sides. According to the problem description, the function should find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, not just squares. For example, if the input is `6` sticks of lengths `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, the program will return `1` (one square), but the correct answer should be `2` (two equilateral triangles). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
