The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times a unique integer appears in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers (each representing the length of a stick) with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4.**
