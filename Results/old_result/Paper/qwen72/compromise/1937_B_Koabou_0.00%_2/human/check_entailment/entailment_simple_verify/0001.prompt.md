You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the width of the grid.
   - It then reads two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`, which represent the two rows of the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It also initializes a variable `x` to 0, which will be used to track the position where the grasshopper should switch from the top row to the bottom row.
   - The program iterates through the columns from 0 to `n-2` (i.e., `n-1` in Python's zero-based indexing).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the next cell in the top row (`a[0][i + 1]`) is '1' and the current cell in the bottom row (`a[1][i]`) is '0'.
   - If this condition is met, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of the top row up to column `i` with the suffix of the bottom row starting from column `i`.
   - It sets `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the switch point has been found.
   - If no such switch point is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row with the last cell of the bottom row.
   - This logic ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is found by preferring the top row as long as possible and switching to the bottom row only when necessary to avoid a '1'.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will be used to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the columns from 0 to `x-1` to count the number of valid paths.
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the prefix of the top row up to column `i` matches the prefix of the string `s` up to column `i`.
   - If the prefix matches, it sets `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic is intended to count the number of valid paths by considering the point where the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the lexicographically smallest string.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It then prints the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string is correct. The program ensures that the grasshopper stays in the top row as long as possible and switches to the bottom row only when necessary to avoid a '1'.
- However, the logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. The variable `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and then immediately printed, which does not correctly count the number of valid paths. The number of valid paths should be the number of ways to reach the switch point plus the number of ways to reach the end from the switch point.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string.
- The program does not correctly count the number of paths that yield this string.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
