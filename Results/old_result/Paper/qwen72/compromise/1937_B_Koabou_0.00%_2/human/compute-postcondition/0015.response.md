Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a 2xN grid (represented as two strings of 0s and 1s) from user input. It then processes the grid to find the first column index `i` where the element in the first row is '1' and the element in the second row is '0'. If such an index is found, it constructs a new string `s` by concatenating the substring from the first row up to index `i` with the substring from the second row starting from index `i`. If no such index is found, `s` is constructed by concatenating the entire first row with the last element of the second row. The function also calculates an integer `t` which is the length of the longest prefix of the first row that matches the corresponding prefix of `s`. Finally, the function prints the string `s` and the integer `t`. **
