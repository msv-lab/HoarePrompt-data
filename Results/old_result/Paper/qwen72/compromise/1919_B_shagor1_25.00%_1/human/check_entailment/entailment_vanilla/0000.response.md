### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negative Elements**:
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero. If the sum of the entire array is zero, the penalty is zero.
   - If the sum of the entire array is not zero, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1, each contributing a penalty of 1 (since the absolute sum of a single element is 1 and the length is 1).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` consists entirely of '+' or '-', the penalty is simply the length of the string `n` because each element will contribute a penalty of 1.
   - If the string `s` has an equal number of '+' and '-', the penalty is zero because the sum of the entire array is zero.

5. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `n - 2 * neg` calculates the number of '+' characters in the string, as `neg` is the number of '-' characters.
   - If `n != neg`, it means there are more '+' or '-' characters, and the penalty is the number of elements that are not balanced (i.e., the number of '+' characters).
   - If `n == neg`, it means the string is balanced, and the penalty is zero.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the given problem by counting the number of '-' characters and using the derived formula to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The logic and the formula are consistent with the problem description and handle all edge cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
