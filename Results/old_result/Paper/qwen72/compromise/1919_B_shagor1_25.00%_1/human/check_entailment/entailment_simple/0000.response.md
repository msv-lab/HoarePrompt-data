### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` of `+` and `-` characters.
   - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - It initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of `-` characters in the string `s`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `neg` for each `-` character.
   - The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation is based on the observation that the optimal way to split the array `a` (derived from `s`) is to split it into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string `s` consists entirely of `-` characters. In this case, the penalty is `n` because the sum of each subarray will be `-1` and the length will be `1`, resulting in a penalty of `1` for each subarray.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is calculated as `n - 2 * neg`. This formula works because:
     - `n` is the total length of the string.
     - `2 * neg` is the total length of the `-` characters, which contribute `-1` to the sum.
     - `n - 2 * neg` effectively calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is the sum of the array `a` when split optimally.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, processes each test case, and calculates the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description. The logic for calculating the penalty is sound and matches the expected behavior.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
