### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - We need to split the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in the string and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each `+` contributes `1` to the sum and each `-` contributes `-1` to the sum.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is equal, the sum of the entire array is `0`, and the penalty is `0` because the absolute value of the sum is `0`.
   - If the number of `+` and `-` characters is not equal, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays of length `1` (i.e., each character is its own subarray). This is because the penalty for a subarray of length `1` is always `1` (since the absolute value of `1` or `-1` is `1`).
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` calculates the number of `+` characters minus the number of `-` characters, and then multiplies by the length of each subarray (which is `1` in this case).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters. In this case, the penalty is `n` because each subarray of length `1` will have a penalty of `1`, and there are `n` such subarrays.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum penalty is sound and matches the problem requirements.
