The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` that are initially provided by the function `func_3`. The function computes a set `ans` of integers, starting with the set containing only `x`. Over `m` iterations, it updates `ans` by adding the results of `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, where `r` and `c` are obtained from the output of `func_1()`. The operations added to `ans` depend on the value of `c`: if `c` is '0', only `(q + r) % n` is added; if `c` is '1', only `(q - r) % n` is added; if `c` is '?', both are added. After all iterations, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added. The function then prints the number of elements in `ans` and the elements themselves. The final state of the program is that `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` contains the computed set of integers as described.
