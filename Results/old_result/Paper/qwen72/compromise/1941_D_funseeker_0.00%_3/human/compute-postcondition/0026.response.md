Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` and `temp` remain empty sets.
- The string returned by `func_1()` is split into two parts. The first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `r`, and the second part is assigned to `c` as a string.
- `_` is incremented by 1, but its value is not specified in the initial state, so it is only noted that it must be less than `m` for the loop to continue.
