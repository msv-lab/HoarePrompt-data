Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged after the loop.
   - `ans` is a list that contains all possible results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in the initial `ans`, depending on the value of `c` during each iteration.
   - If `c` is '0', only the results of `(q + r) % n` are added to `ans`.
   - If `c` is '1', only the results of `(q - r) % n` are added to `ans`.
   - If `c` is '?', both results are added to `ans`.
   - The loop counter `_` is equal to `m`.
   - If `0` was an element in `ans`, it is no longer present, and `n` is now an element in `ans`.
   - If `0` was not an element in `ans`, `ans` remains as described above.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements in the list `ans`, separated by spaces.
   - The elements in `ans` are the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c` during each iteration.
   - If `0` was in `ans` initially, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - If `0` was not in `ans` initially, `ans` remains as the results of the operations described.

4. **Output:**
   - The exact values in `ans` depend on the initial values of `ans`, `n`, and `r`, as well as the values of `c` during each iteration of the loop.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **[elements of ans after all operations, with 0 removed if it was present and n added if 0 was removed] (where each element is the result of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c` during each iteration, and `n` is the value of `n`)**

This output description covers all the possible scenarios based on the initial state and the operations described.
