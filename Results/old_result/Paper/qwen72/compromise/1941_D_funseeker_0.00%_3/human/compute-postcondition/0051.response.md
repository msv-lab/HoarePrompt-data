Output State: **`ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `r` is now an integer value of the original `r` returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is now the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `_` is 0, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = set()` reassigns `temp` to an empty set. All other variables (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `temp` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
