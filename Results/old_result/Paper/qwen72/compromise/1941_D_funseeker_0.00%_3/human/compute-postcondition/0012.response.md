Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`; `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the integers `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.***
