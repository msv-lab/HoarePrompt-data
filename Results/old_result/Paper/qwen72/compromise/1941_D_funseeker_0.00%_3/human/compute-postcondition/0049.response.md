Output State: **`ans` now contains the elements that were in `temp`, `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `r` and `c` are now the values returned by `func_1().split()`, `_` is 0.** 

The initial state indicates that `ans` contains the elements from `temp`, and `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The variables `r` and `c` were previously determined by the string returned by `func_1()`, and after executing the code snippet, `r` and `c` are updated to the values obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()`. The variable `_` remains 0.
