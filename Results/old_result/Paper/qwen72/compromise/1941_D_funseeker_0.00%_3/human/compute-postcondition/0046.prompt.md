Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least two elements. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '?', also `(q - r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` must contain at least one element. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is a string resulting from the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. `q` is the next element in `ans`. If `c` is not '1' or '?', the state of `temp`, `q`, and `_` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
