Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n; `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`; `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `c` is either '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the integer `(q + r) % n` and the integer `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The value of `n`, `m`, and `x` remains unchanged.
- The set `ans` still contains the integer `x`.
- The value of `r` remains the integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`.
- The value of `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`, and it is either '1' or '?'.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` was already a set containing the integer `(q + r) % n`, and now it also contains the integer `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '1', `temp` remains an empty set, and now it contains the integer `(q - r) % n`.
