The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute one more time if the current value of `_` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
- `ans` is an empty set.
- `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`.
- `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `temp` is an empty set.

Since `_` is the loop counter and it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `m`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. `ans` is an empty set. `r` is an integer resulting from the conversion of the string `r` returned by `func_1()`. `c` remains a string resulting from the split of the string returned by `func_1()`. `temp` is an empty set. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again.**
