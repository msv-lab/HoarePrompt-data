The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. According to the provided output cases, the function does not return any value in either case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` and not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` and does not return any value.**
