The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18) and performs the following actions based on the input values:

- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES" followed by two "1"s and then returns.
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and then returns.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and updates `n` accordingly. If the sum of these quotients (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "2", "YES", and the elements of the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` (which are `1 - k` and `1`).

In all cases, the function does not return any value.
