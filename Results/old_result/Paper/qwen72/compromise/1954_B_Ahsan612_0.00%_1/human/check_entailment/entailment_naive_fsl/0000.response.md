Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and consists of more than two different elements. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts consecutive elements that are the same and does not properly account for the structure of a beautiful array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program should output `1` because removing the last element (or any other element that is not part of a sequence of three identical elements) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program's logic will incorrectly output `2` because it counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same and then finds the minimum of these counts.

The issue lies in the way the program updates the `minn` variable and the `same` counter. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The program should instead focus on identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property, which involves checking for sequences of three identical elements surrounded by different elements.
