Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is the fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or 1.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `same`.
- The current value of `minn` is either 1 or infinity.
- The value of `same` is either 1 or 2.
- If `minn` is 1, the minimum of 1 and `same` (which is either 1 or 2) is still 1.
- If `minn` is infinity, the minimum of infinity and `same` (which is either 1 or 2) is 1.
- Therefore, `minn` is now 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
