Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**. 

The value of `i` remains incremented by 2, and the length of `ar` is still greater than the current value of `i`. The variable `num` is now assigned the value of the element in `ar` at the index `i`.
