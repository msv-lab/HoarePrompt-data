The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

- If `ar[1] == num` and `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 3, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is set to `inf`, and `same` is 3.
- If `ar[1] == num` and `ar[i] != num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is 2, and `same` is 1.
- If `ar[1] != num` and `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 2.
- If `ar[1] != num` and `ar[i] != num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.**
