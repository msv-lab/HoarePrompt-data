Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `num` is the fourth element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or 1.**

The value of `same` is set to 1, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
