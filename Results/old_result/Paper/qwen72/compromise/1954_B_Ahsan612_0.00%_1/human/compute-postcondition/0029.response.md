Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is now the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`.**
