The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return some result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints and the properties of the list `a`.**
