Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, and `minn` is currently equal to `inf`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`.**
