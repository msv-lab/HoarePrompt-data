Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the input to the loop must be a positive integer greater than 0.**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
