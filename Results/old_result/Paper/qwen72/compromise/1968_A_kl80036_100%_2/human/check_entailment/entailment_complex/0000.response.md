Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it. Let's analyze why this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the only common divisor they have is 1.

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**: Given that \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) becomes \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \). This is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) can be at most \( x - 1 \).

3. **Output**: The program prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then reads \( x \) for each test case, ensuring that the input constraints are respected.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where \( x = 2 \) correctly. For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.

Given this analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
