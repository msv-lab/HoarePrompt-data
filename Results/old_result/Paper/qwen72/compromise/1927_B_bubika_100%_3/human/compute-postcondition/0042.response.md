Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers input by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `s` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`a`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `r` is still a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the integers in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`, but `s` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
