The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases internally and does not accept any arguments when called. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of a lost string, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The function should return a valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z for each test case, based on the provided trace and length. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists at least one valid string `s`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases internally, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a valid string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z for each test case, based on the provided trace `a`.**
