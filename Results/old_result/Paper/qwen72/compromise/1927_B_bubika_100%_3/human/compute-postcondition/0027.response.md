Output State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one integer, `r` is 'z', `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `x` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r += a[x]` appends the character at index `x` of string `a` to the string `r`.
- Since `x` is -1, it refers to the last character of `a`, which is 'z'.
- Therefore, `r` is updated to 'z'.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.
