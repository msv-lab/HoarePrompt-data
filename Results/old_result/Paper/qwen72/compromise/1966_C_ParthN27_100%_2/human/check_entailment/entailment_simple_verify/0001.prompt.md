You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from the piles.
   - On each turn, a player must choose a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - If all piles have the same number of stones, the player who goes first (Alice) can remove all stones in one move and win.
   - If the piles have different numbers of stones, the game can be analyzed using the concept of the "Nim Game" or by considering the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It then creates a set \( s \) to store the distinct pile sizes.
   - The set is converted to a list and sorted.
   - A dummy element 0 is added to the beginning of the list to simplify the comparison.
   - The program initializes \( ans \) to 1, which will be used to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is 2, Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
   - Otherwise, the program iterates through the sorted list of distinct pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and the final value of \( ans \) is used to determine the winner.
   - If \( ans \) is 1, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where all piles have the same number of stones (Alice wins).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the number of distinct pile sizes is 2 (Alice wins).
   - However, the program's logic for determining the winner when there are more than 2 distinct pile sizes is flawed. The condition `if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` is not relevant to the game's rules. The game's outcome should be determined by the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes, not by the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins.
     - If the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob wins.
   - This is because the game is symmetric, and the player who faces an even number of distinct pile sizes will always lose if both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an irrelevant condition to determine the winner. The correct condition should be based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.

### Correctness:
**False**
