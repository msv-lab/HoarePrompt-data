Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains the first and second integers from `arr`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the second integer from the list `arr` to the set `s`.
- Initially, `s` contains the first integer from `arr`.
- After executing the code, `s` now contains both the first and second integers from `arr`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The list `arr` is still a list of integers provided by the user.
