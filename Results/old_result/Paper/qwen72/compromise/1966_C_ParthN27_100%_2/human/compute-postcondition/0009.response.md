Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`.**

The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the third element of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained the first two elements of `arr`, and now it contains the first three elements of `arr`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
