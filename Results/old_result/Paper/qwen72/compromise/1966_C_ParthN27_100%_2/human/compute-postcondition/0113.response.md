Output State: **`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning, `ans` is 1 if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The length of the list `s` remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after all iterations, as it increments from 1 to `n-2`.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The list `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` depends on whether the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop completes without breaking, `ans` will be 1. If the loop breaks at any point, `ans` will be 0. The loop breaks if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (excluding the first element) is greater than 1. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1 with each iteration.
