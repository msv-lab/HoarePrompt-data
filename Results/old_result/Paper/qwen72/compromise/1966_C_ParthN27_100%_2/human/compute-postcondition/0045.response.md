Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` contains the first integer from `arr`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the first element of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`. The set `s` was initially empty, so now it contains the first integer from `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
