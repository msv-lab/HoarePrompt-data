Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning. If the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` (which is 0) is greater than 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` is not set. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
