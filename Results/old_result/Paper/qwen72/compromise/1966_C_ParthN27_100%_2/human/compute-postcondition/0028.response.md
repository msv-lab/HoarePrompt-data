Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and the loop or if statement has been broken. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.***
