Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the length of the list `s`.
- Since `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, the length of `s` is one more than the length of `arr`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `n-1`, which is the length of `s` minus 1.
- The values of `t`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
