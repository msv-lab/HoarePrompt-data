The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`.**
