The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes several variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Initial State:
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with 0 prepended at the beginning.
- `ans` is 0.

The `print` statement:
```
print('Bob')
```

Since the `print` statement only prints the string `'Bob'`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Output: **Bob**
