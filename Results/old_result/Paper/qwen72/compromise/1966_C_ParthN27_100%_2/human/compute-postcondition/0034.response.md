Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop, `n` is now equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` in ascending order, with an additional 0 at the beginning. The current value of `ans` is 1, indicating that the difference between at least one pair of consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` is greater than 1.**
