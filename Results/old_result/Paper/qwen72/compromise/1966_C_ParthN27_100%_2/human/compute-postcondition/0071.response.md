Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list of integers from `arr` with 0 prepended, `ans` is 1 or 0 depending on the previous value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is toggled (flipped) using the XOR operation with 1. If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1; if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
