Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed does not follow the problem description for calculating the minimum possible penalty. The function simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

The counterexample provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrates this issue. For the input `+-+-+-`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`. However, the provided program calculates the penalty as `3` because it returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3` (3 '+' and 3 '-').

This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not consider the sum of the elements in the subarrays and their lengths, which are crucial for calculating the penalty correctly. The correct solution would need to dynamically determine the optimal splits to minimize the total penalty, which is not what the current program does.

Final: **False**
