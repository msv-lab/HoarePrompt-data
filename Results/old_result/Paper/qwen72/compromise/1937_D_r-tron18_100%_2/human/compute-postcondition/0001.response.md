Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting only of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, pre is a list of integers representing the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of '>' in s1, totalOne is the number of occurrences of '>' in s1.**

Explanation: The variable `totalOne` is assigned the value of the length of the list `pre`, which represents the indices of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
