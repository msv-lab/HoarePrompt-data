To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the `ans` list:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- Each element of `ans` represents the difference between the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters, adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `preOne` is an empty list.
- `totalOne` is 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.

### Analysis:
1. **`ans` List**:
   - The list `ans` is described as having a length `n`.
   - Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters, and some adjustments are made inside a loop.
   - Since the exact content of the string or the loop conditions are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`.

2. **`preOne` List**:
   - `preOne` is an empty list, so it does not affect the output of `print(*ans)`.

3. **`totalOne` Variable**:
   - `totalOne` is 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **`suffZero` List**:
   - `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, separated by spaces. Since the exact values of the elements in `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `ans`.

Output: **[ans[0], ans[1], ..., ans[n-1]] (where each element is the difference between the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters, adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop)**

This means that the output will be a sequence of numbers, each representing the calculated difference for the corresponding index in the `ans` list.
