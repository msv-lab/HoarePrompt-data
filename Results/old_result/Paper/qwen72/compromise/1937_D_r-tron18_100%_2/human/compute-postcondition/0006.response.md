Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the difference between the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters, adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop. `preOne` is an empty list. `totalOne` is 0. `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last character of `s1` to the first.
- For each '>' character, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, and `totalOne` is decremented.
- For each '<' character, `suffZero` is updated by appending the cumulative sum of the current index.
- The `ans` list is populated with the calculated differences based on the conditions inside the loop.
- After the loop completes, `preOne` will be empty, `totalOne` will be 0, and `suffZero` will have a single element 0.
