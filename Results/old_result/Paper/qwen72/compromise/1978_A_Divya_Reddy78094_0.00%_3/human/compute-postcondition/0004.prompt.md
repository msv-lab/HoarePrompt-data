You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book, and an integer `n` representing the number of books, where 2 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It will sort `nums` in descending order and print the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` will be undefined or reset for the next iteration, and any other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the number of pages in each book and `n` represents the number of books. It returns the total number of pages across all books.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
