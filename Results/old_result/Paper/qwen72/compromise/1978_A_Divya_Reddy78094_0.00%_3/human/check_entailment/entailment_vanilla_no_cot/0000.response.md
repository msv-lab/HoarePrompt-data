Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.
3. It sorts the list of pages in descending order.
4. The sum of the pages of the two largest books is printed, which is the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.

This logic works because the two largest numbers in the list represent the maximum pages that can be read, regardless of how the rest of the books are divided. The program ensures that the two piles will always contain at least one book each, satisfying the problem's requirement for non-empty piles.
