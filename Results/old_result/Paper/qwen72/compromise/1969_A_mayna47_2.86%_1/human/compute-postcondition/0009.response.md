Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. If `n` is 2, `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the remaining two elements as integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop will either print `2` and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.***
