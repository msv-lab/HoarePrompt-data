The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p`. The integer `n` represents the number of friends, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list `p` contains integers representing the best friends of each friend, where each element `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns the minimum number of invitations required to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
