The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is already defined to be between 3 and 50, inclusive, this condition is already met. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to start, `i` needs to be set to 1, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 3 and 50, inclusive, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `i` is 1**
