The code snippet contains a `print` statement that explicitly prints the integer value `2`.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer with a value of 2.
- `v` is a list of length 3 where the first element is 0 and the remaining two elements are integers provided by the user.

The `print` statement does not use any variables or objects from the initial state; it simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
