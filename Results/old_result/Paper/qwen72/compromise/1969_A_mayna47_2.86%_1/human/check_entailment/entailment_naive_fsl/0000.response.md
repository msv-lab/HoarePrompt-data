Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required for certain configurations of best friends.

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 1 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

In this case, the friends can be paired as (1, 2) and (3, 4), and Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3. Both pairs will come to the party, but the program incorrectly outputs 3. This is because the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not cover all possible configurations of best friends, especially those that form cycles of length 2.
