Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's why:

1. The program checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and prints 2 if this condition is met. This condition is true for a cycle of length 3, but it does not cover all cases where at least 2 friends can be invited with the minimum number of invitations.

2. The program prints 3 if no cycle of length 3 is found, but this is not always the correct answer. For example, in the case where there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program should print 2, but it might print 3 if it doesn't find a cycle of length 3.

3. The program does not handle the case where there are multiple cycles of length 2 (pairs of friends who are each other's best friends) or other complex structures in the graph formed by the best friend relationships.

A correct solution would need to identify the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. This involves identifying cycles and pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, and then determining the minimum number of invitations required to cover these cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_length = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = p[current]
                    cycle_length += 1
                
                if cycle_length == 2:
                    min_invitations = 2
                    break
                elif cycle_length == 3:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
                else:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_length)
        
        print(min(min_invitations, 3))
```

This version correctly identifies cycles and pairs of friends, and ensures that the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party is printed.
