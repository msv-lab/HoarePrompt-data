### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with the first element as 0, and the remaining elements as the integers provided by the user.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If `n` is 2, the function prints 2 and returns. This is correct because if there are only 2 friends, Monocarp must invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Cycles of Length 3**:
   - The function then iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1` (excluding 0).
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, Monocarp can send invitations to any two friends in the cycle to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - If the condition is met, the function prints 2 and returns.

5. **Default Case**:
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the function prints 3. This is because in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is based on the assumption that the best friend relationships form a more complex structure that requires at least 3 invitations to ensure 2 friends attend.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Cycle of Length 3**: The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` checks for a cycle of length 3. If such a cycle exists, Monocarp can invite any two friends in the cycle, and both will come to the party.
- **Default Case**: If no cycle of length 3 is found, the function assumes that the minimum number of invitations required is 3. This is a reasonable assumption because in the worst case, Monocarp might need to invite 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

### Edge Cases:
- **n == 2**: The function correctly handles this case by printing 2.
- **n > 2**: The function correctly checks for cycles of length 3 and prints 2 if such a cycle is found. If no such cycle is found, it prints 3, which is the correct default case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the problem description. It ensures that the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends at the party is calculated and printed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
