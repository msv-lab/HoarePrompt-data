You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return or print the length of the array and the array itself if a valid array exists, or -1 if no such array can be found.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The function will print the number of operations (t) required to reduce X to 1 and the sequence of operations (ans) in reverse order. If the loop completes, the final value of X will be 1, and the array ans will contain the sequence of operations that were performed. The variables max and min will be updated based on the operations performed, but their final values depend on the specific input X.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any input parameters. It handles multiple test cases, each with a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, if a valid array exists, it returns the length of the array and the array itself. If no valid array can be found, it returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
