Output State: **The function will print the number of operations (t) required to reduce X to 1 and the sequence of operations (ans) in reverse order. If the loop completes, the final value of X will be 1, and the array ans will contain the sequence of operations that were performed. The variables max and min will be updated based on the operations performed, but their final values depend on the specific input X.**
