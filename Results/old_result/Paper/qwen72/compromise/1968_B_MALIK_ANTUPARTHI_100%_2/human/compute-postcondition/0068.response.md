Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is the index at which the loop broke or `b` if the loop completed, and `k` is the last index in `e` where `d[j]` was found, or the value of `j` if the loop did not find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged.
- The variable `j` will be the index at which the loop broke, or it will be equal to `b` if the loop completed without breaking.
- The variable `k` will be the last index in `e` where the current element of `d` (i.e., `d[j]`) was found, or it will be the value of `j` if the loop did not find `d[j]` in `e[k:]`.
