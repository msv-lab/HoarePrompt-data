Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 2. `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to `k`. Given that `j` is 2, `k` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e`) are not affected by this code, so they retain their initial values. The condition about `d[j]` being in `e[k:]` is not relevant to the code snippet provided, so it does not affect the output state.
