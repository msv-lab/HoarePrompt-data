Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial values. `j` is 2. `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 2) to `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, and `e`) retain their initial values. The conditions mentioned in the initial state are not affected by this assignment, so they remain as they were.
