Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `d` is the input value, `e` is the new input value, `j` is 0, `k` is the index of the element `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. Additionally, either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`.**
