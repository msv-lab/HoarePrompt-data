You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = input()
        
        e = input()
        
        k = 0
        
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        
        print(k)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is `a - 1`, `d` is the input value for the last iteration, `e` is the input value for the last iteration, `j` is `b` if the loop completed, otherwise it is the index at which the loop broke. `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop completes or breaks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (representing the lengths of two binary strings `d` and `e`), and then reads the binary strings `d` and `e` from the input. The function then processes these strings to find the index `k` where the characters of `d` can be matched in `e` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. After processing, it prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are no longer relevant, and `i` is `a - 1`. The function is designed to handle up to `10^4` test cases, with the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the prefix of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b` but the index `k` in string `b` exceeds the length of `b` before the loop ends. This can lead to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
10011
11010
```
The correct output should be `4` because the prefix `1001` of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b`. However, the program will output `3` because it incorrectly updates `k` and does not account for the possibility that the subsequence can continue beyond the current `k` value.
