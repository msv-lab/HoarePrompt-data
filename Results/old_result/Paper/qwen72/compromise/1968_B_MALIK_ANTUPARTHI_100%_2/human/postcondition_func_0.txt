The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (representing the lengths of two binary strings `d` and `e`), and then reads the binary strings `d` and `e` from the input. The function then processes these strings to find the index `k` where the characters of `d` can be matched in `e` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. After processing, it prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are no longer relevant, and `i` is `a - 1`. The function is designed to handle up to `10^4` test cases, with the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.
