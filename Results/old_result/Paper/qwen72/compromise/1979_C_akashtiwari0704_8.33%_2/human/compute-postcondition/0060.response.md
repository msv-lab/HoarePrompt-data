Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` is 1.
- `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
- Each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now equal to `prod // a[i]` before the modification.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to the current value of `prod`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `-1`. The values of `sumo`, `prod`, `a`, `bets`, `t`, and `T` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
