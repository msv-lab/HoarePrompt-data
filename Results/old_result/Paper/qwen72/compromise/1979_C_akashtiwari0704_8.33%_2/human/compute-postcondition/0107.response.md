Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `t - 1`, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[index]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further action is taken. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, so after all iterations, `T` will be `t - 1`.
- For each iteration, `bets` is an integer input by the user, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `prod` is calculated as the product of all elements in `a`.
- Each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `-1` is printed.
- If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the string representation of the updated elements in `a` is printed, with each element followed by a space.
