Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the user, where each test case involves a set of multipliers. For each test case, it calculates a product of these multipliers and then modifies the multipliers such that each is replaced by the product divided by the original multiplier. It sums these modified multipliers and checks if this sum is less than the original product. If the sum is less, it prints the modified multipliers as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function processes up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. Each test case involves up to 50 multipliers, each between 2 and 20. **
