Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the current implementation only checks if the length of the processed string `s1` is at least `n * k`. This is insufficient because it does not verify the presence of all possible subsequences.
   - The logic inside the loop where characters are removed from `alphabet` and added to `s1` and `s2` is not aligned with the requirement to check all possible subsequences. The condition `if len(alphabet) != 1:` and the subsequent operations do not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**:
   - When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending a character that is not in `s1` to the end of `s2`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.
   - For example, in the case where `s = "abb"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the program might incorrectly generate "bb" instead of "aa".

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is 1. In this case, the only possible string of length `n` is a string of repeated characters. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The correct output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
No
bb
```
This is incorrect because the string "aa" is a valid string of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets and does not occur as a subsequence in "abb".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem as described and fails in multiple scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
