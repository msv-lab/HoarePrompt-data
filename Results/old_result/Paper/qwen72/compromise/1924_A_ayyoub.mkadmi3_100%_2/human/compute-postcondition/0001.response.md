Output State: **s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string.**

The code initializes `s2` as an empty string, which was previously undefined. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
