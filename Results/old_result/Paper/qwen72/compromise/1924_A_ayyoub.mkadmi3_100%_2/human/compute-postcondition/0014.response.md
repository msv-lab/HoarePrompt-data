To solve this, let's go through the code and its impact step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`. The size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code attempts to remove the second character of `s` (`i`) from the set `alphabet`.
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it will be removed, and the size of `alphabet` will decrease by 1.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`, the operation will have no effect.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, `alphabet` will have one less element, specifically `i` will be removed.
   - The size of `alphabet` will be `k-2` if `i` was in `alphabet` and `k-1` was not 1.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

4. **Output State Calculation**:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`:
     - `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`.
     - The size of `alphabet` is now `k-2` if `k-1` was not 1.
     - `s1` and `s2` remain as defined in the initial state.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`:
     - No changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

Output State: **If `i` is in `alphabet`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`, the size of `alphabet` is now `k-2` if `k-1` was not 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`, and the size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1.**
