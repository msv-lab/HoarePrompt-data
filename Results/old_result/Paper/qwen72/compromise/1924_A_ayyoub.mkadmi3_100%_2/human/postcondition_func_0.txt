The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It processes the string `s` to create two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are part of a dynamically changing set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets (`alphabet`). If the set `alphabet` is reduced to a single element, that element is added to `s2` instead, and the set is reset to its initial state. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.
