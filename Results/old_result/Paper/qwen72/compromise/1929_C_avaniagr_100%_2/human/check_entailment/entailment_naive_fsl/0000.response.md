Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is exactly `x + 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha should be able to guarantee that he can win any number of coins if `a >= x + 1` when `x < k - 1`, and `a >= x + 2` when `x == k - 1`. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for the case where `x == k - 1` and `a == x + 1`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
YES
```

Actual output from the program:
```
NO
```

This is because the program checks `if a >= x + 2` when `x == k - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if a >= x + 1` for this case.
