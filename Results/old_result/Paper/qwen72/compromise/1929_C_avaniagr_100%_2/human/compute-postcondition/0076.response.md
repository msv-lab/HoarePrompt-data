Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the fourth line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the fourth line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 4 lines, and `s` is the fourth line of the file. If `x < k - 1`, the program continues with the variables retaining their values. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x != k - 1` and `x` is at least `k - 3`, `z` is the result of the loop after `x - k + 3` iterations, where each iteration updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
