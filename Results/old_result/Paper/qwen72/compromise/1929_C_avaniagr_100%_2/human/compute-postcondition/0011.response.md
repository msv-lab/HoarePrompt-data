Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an integer where \(2 \leq k \leq 30\).
- `x` is an integer where \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), and it is given that \(x = k - 1\).
- `a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), and it is given that the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to \(x + 2\).
- The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
