You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of unique integers and an implicit parameter `k`. It returns an integer based on the following cases:
1. If there are no elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one element in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of this element is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
   - If the index of this element is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this element minus 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element greater than `a[k]`.
3. If there are two elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`:
   - If the index of the first element is 0, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
   - If `k` is greater than the index of the second element, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` and the value of `x` (which is `a[k]`) remain unchanged. If `k` is 14, the function may print the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements greater than `a[14]` or all such elements if there are fewer than two.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination style where the winner of each match moves on to the next match.
   - We can swap the position of cow `k` with another cow once to maximize the number of wins.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - The ratings of the cows are given in a list.
   - The output is the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(a)` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
   - The function starts by storing the rating of cow `k` in `x` and initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with higher ratings.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the number of cows with higher ratings encountered.

4. **Finding Higher Ratings:**
   - The function iterates through the list of ratings and appends the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x` to `ind`.
   - It stops after finding the second cow with a higher rating (`c == 2`).

5. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If no cow has a higher rating (`ind == []`), cow `k` can win all matches except the last one, so the function returns `n - 1`.
   - If only one cow has a higher rating (`len(ind) == 1`):
     - If this cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `k - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is after cow `k`, cow `k` can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - If two cows have higher ratings:
     - If the first cow is at position 0, cow `k` can win up to `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If cow `k` is after the second cow, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

6. **Edge Case Consideration:**
   - The function includes a debug print statement `if k == 14: print(ind)`, which is not necessary for the solution and can be removed.
   - The function handles the cases where cow `k` is the highest-rated cow, the second highest-rated cow, and other positions correctly.

7. **Logical Flow:**
   - The function correctly identifies the positions of cows with higher ratings and calculates the maximum number of wins based on these positions.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is sound and covers all possible scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1(a)` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k` based on the problem description. The function handles all edge cases and the logical flow is correct.

Correctness: **True**
