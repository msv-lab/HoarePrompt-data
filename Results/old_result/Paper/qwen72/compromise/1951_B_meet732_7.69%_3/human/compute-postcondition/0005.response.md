Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, and `c` is 2. If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, `ind` will contain the indices of those elements, and `c` will be the number of such elements. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged. Additionally, `k` is 14.**
