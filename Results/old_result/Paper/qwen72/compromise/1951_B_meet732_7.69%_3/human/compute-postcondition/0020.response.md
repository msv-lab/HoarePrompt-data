Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, and `c` is 2. If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`, `ind` will contain the indices of those elements, and `c` will be the number of such elements. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `k` is 14, this condition is retained. `ind` is not an empty list, and `ind` contains more than one element. The first element of `ind` is 0.**
