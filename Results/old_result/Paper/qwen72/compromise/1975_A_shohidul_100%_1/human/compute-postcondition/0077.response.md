The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`, the `print` statement will always output the same string.

Output: **NO**
