Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 2.
- `check_all` is set to `False` if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
