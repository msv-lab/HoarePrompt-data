Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1, the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is True, `new_all` is True, and the elements of `new` are in non-decreasing order, and the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
