To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
4. `i` is 1.
5. `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
6. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
7. `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
8. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.
9. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
10. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
11. `check_all_new` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the implications:

- Since `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the list `a` is not in non-decreasing order. Therefore, `check_all` must be `False`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `check_all_new` being `True` means all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`.
- `new_all` being `True` means all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

Given that both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, it implies that the sublist `new` meets the criteria of being in non-decreasing order and all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`.

Since the conditions for `check_all_new` and `new_all` are met, the print statement will execute and print "YES".

Output: **YES**
