Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1, the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is the result of the condition `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`, `new_all` is the result of the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
