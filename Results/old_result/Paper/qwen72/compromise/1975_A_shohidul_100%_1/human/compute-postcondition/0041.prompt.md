Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, indicating that the list `a` is not non-decreasing up to the index `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, the elements of `new` are in non-decreasing order, and the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index 0 of `a` is not greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, the program continues without modifying any variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2. If `a[1]` > `a[2]`, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False. Regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True or not, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[1]` â‰¤ `a[2]`, the program continues without modifying any variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3. If `a[2]` > `a[3]`, `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is False. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
