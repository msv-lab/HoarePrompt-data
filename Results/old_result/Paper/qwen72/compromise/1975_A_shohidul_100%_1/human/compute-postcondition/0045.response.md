Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `check_all` is unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If `check_all` is True, the list `a` is non-decreasing up to the index `n-1`. If `check_all` is False, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, and the program has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. For each pair, if the element at the previous index was greater than the current element, it checked if the remaining sublist (from the current index to the end) is in non-decreasing order and if all elements in this sublist are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If both conditions were met, it printed 'YES' and broke out of the loop. If either condition was not met, it printed 'NO' and broke out of the loop. If none of these conditions were met during the entire loop, the loop completed without printing anything.**
