The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. The function accepts the following:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array.

The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to process these inputs and return some result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. The function returns a result based on the processing of each test case.**
