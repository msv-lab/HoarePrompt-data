You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases, each containing four integers p_i (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a total of t iterations, where t is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output will be the sum of the integer division of each of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the input integers are odd. The state of the variables a, b, c, and d will be reset for each new test case, and the loop variable i will increment from 0 to t-1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins as many times as possible.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **XOR of Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:**
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 7 \)

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) will always result in a zero XOR for those pairs.
   - If the total number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is odd, removing one of these numbers will leave an odd number of the remaining types, which can be paired to zero out the XOR.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero: \( a // 2 \), \( b // 2 \), \( c // 2 \), and \( d // 2 \).
   - It also checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) is 3, which indicates that removing one more number will make the XOR zero.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed.
   - The additional check for the sum of remainders being 3 is necessary to handle the case where the total number of 1s, 2s, and 3s is odd, and removing one more number will make the XOR zero.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
