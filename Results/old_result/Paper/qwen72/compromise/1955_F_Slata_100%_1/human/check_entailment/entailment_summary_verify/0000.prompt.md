You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing four integers (a, b, c, d) representing counts. It prints the sum of the integer division of each count by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the counts are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables (a, b, c, d) are no longer relevant, and the loop variable `i` has incremented from 0 to t-1, where t is the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal removal strategy when the counts of the numbers are such that the XOR of the remaining sequence can be zero. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0 0 0 4
```
The sequence consists of four 4s. The XOR of four 4s is:
```
4 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 0
```
So, Bob wins initially. However, if Eve removes one 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 4
```
Now, Alice wins. If Eve removes another 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4 ^ 4 = 0
```
Bob wins again. If Eve removes another 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4
```
Alice wins. Finally, if Eve removes the last 4, the sequence is empty, and Bob wins.

Thus, Bob can win 3 times in this case. However, the program will output:
```
2
```
because it only considers the number of pairs of each type and does not handle the case where the count of a single number is even and greater than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
