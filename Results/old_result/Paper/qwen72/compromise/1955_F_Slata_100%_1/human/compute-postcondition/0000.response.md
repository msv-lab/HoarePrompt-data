The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, as it determines the number of iterations. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment for each iteration.

Given that the problem description implies that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4, we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is at least 1 to make the loop execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
