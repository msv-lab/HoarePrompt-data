### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a chessboard where players alternately place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player starts by placing a white rook, and the computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position.
   - If the player places a rook on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations of the board after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the initial moves and processes them to determine the number of rooks already placed.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks**:
   - The program counts the number of rooks already placed by the player and the computer.
   - If a rook is placed on the diagonal, it increments `num` by 1.
   - If a rook is placed off the diagonal, it increments `num` by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's mirrored move).

4. **Remaining Moves Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining positions \( m \) where rooks can still be placed as \( m = n - num \).

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Configurations**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( i \times i \).
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger boards, it uses the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( i \times i \) by considering the last row and column.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the initial moves, and uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of final configurations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
