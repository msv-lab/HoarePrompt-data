The value of `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes are made. If `m` is 1, `i` is `k-1`. If `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, each calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
