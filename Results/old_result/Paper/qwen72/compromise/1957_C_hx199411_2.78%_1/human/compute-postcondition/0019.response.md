The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num` is unknown, but it is now `num + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is incremented by 1.**
