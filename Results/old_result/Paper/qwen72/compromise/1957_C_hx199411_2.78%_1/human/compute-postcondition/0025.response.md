Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- The current value of `m` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(0)
```

This code snippet simply prints the integer `0`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **0**
