The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The initial state specifies that `num` is an integer provided by the user input, and its value is not specified. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are the new integers provided by the user input, `num` is increased by 2.**
