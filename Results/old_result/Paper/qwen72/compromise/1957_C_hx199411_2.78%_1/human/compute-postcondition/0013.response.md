Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new values of `c` and `r` are now integers provided by the user.
