To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `i` is set to `m`.
   - `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except:
     - `dp[1]` is 1.
     - `dp[2]` is 3.
     - For \(3 \leq i \leq m\), each `dp[i]` is calculated as \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - The `dp` list is initialized with specific values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - For each subsequent index \(i\) from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[i]` is computed using the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the result of the dynamic programming calculation up to the index `m`.

Given the initial state and the dynamic programming formula, the value of `dp[m]` is determined by the recursive relationship and the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the specified range.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of the dp list at index m, calculated using the dynamic programming formula (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for 3 ≤ i ≤ m, with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
