To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k-1`
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop
- `m` is `n - num`
- `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(3, m + 1)` contains at least one element.
- For `range(3, m + 1)` to contain at least one element, `m` must be at least 3 (since the range starts from 3 and goes up to `m` inclusive).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop iterator, and it will start from 3 and go up to `m`.

### Final State:
- `m` must be at least 3.
- `i` will start from 3.

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 3, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3**
