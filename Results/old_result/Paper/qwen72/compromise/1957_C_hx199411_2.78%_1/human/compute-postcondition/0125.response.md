Postcondition: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is `k-1`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each pair `(c, r)` where `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the program continues with `m` as 1. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m - 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.**
