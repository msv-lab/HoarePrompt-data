Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a non-zero integer where \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.
2. `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
3. `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
4. `i` is `k - 1`.
5. `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input.
6. `m` is `n - num`, where `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r`, and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r`.
7. The current value of `m` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the integer `0`.
- The value of `0` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, or `m`.

Output: **0**
