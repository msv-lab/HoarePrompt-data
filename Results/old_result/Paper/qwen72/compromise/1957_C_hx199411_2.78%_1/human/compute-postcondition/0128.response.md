The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a chessboard and a series of moves. The function accepts no direct parameters but reads from a predefined input structure. For each test case, it takes the following inputs:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, representing the size of the chessboard.
  - `k`: An integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of moves already played.
  - `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, denoting the i-th move made.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Assuming the function is meant to determine some state or outcome based on the moves (e.g., whether a player has won, the next optimal move, etc.), the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a chessboard of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. It returns the result for each test case based on the given moves and the size of the chessboard.**
