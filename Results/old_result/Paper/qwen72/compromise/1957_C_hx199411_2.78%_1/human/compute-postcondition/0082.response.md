To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer where \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
- `dp[1]` is set to 1.
- `dp[2]` is set to 3.
- For each index `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is updated to \((dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `dp`**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
   - `dp[1] = 1`
   - `dp[2] = 3`

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - For each index `j` from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[j]` is calculated as:
     \[
     dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

3. **Final Value**:
   - After the loop completes, `dp[m]` will hold the final value based on the above formula.

### Explanation of the Formula:
- `dp[j - 1]` is the value of the previous element in the list.
- `(j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2` is the product of the index minus one, the value two steps back in the list, and 2.
- The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within a standard integer range and avoids overflow.

### Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the result of the dynamic programming calculation described above.

Since the exact values of `m` and the intermediate calculations are not provided, the output will be the final value of `dp[m]` after the loop has completed.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of the m-th element in the dp list after the dynamic programming calculation)**
