The code initializes a list named `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The length of the list `dp` is `m + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5
- `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- `i` is `k-1`
- `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input
- `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop
- `m` is `n - num`
- `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1

After executing the code:
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
