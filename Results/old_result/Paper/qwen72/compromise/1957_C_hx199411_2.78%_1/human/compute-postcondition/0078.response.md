Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (decremented by 1), `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers provided by the user input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains a non-zero integer within the range 0 < t ≤ 10^4, but it is decremented by 1.
- The value of `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input.
- The value of `k` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `i` remains `k`.
- The values of `c` and `r` remain the last integers provided by the user input.
- The value of `m` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `dp` remains a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros.
- The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain 1 and 3, respectively.
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
