Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input. If `n` is 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
