The code snippet assigns the value of a slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3` to the variable `temp`. Given that `i` is 0, `temp` will be assigned the first three elements of the list `a`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the slice operation is valid and will not raise an error. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a`.**
