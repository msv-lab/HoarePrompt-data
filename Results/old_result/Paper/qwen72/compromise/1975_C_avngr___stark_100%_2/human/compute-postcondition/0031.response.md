Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged, except for the control flow which is affected by the `continue` statement.
