To determine what will be printed by the `print(max)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer. This variable represents the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. The length of this list is `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`. This variable is used to index the list `a`.
   - `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `max`:**
   - We need to find the second smallest element in every consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.
   - For each sub-list of 3 elements, we determine the second smallest element.
   - We then find the maximum value among all these second smallest elements.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 5`.
   - The sub-lists of 3 consecutive elements are:
     - `[1, 2, 3]` -> second smallest element is 2
     - `[2, 3, 4]` -> second smallest element is 3
     - `[3, 4, 5]` -> second smallest element is 4
   - The maximum value among these second smallest elements is 4.
   - Therefore, `max` would be 4 in this case.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any list `a` of length `n`, we will iterate through the list and find the second smallest element in each sub-list of 3 consecutive elements.
   - The `max` variable will store the maximum value of these second smallest elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(max)` statement will print the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in the list `a`.

Output: **max (where max is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in the list `a`)**
