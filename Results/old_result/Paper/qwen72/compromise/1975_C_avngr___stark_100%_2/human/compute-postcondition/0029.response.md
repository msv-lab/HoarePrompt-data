Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any consecutive sub-list of 3 elements in `a`.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers, where each integer is converted from a string input by the user. The length of `a` is determined by the number of integers provided by the user.
