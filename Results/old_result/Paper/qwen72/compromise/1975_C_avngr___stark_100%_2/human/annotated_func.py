#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The array `a` consists of positive integers, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. The elements of the array `a` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n-3` if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `max` is the maximum of the second largest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array and then reads `n` positive integers into the array `a`. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value in the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds the maximum of the second largest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
