You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array and then reads `n` positive integers into the array `a`. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value in the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds the maximum of the second largest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Special Case for n = 2**: The program correctly handles the special case where the length of the array `n` is 2. In this case, the only possible operation is to choose the interval (1, 2), and the median will be the minimum of the two elements. Therefore, the program prints `min(a)` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the median of a two-element array is the smaller of the two elements, and setting both elements to this value will result in the array containing only the smaller element.

3. **General Case for n > 2**: For arrays with more than two elements, the program aims to find the maximum possible value that can be the final number in the array after performing the operations. The program iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3 (from `i` to `i + 2`), sorts each subarray, and checks the median value. The median of a subarray of length 3 is the second element after sorting. The program keeps track of the maximum median value found.

4. **Median Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the median of each subarray of length 3 by sorting the subarray and selecting the middle element. This is a valid approach because the median of a sorted subarray of length 3 is always the second element.

5. **Output**: After processing all subarrays, the program prints the maximum median value found. This value is the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into such that all elements are the same.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:

6. **Edge Case**: The program does not consider subarrays of length greater than 3. While the problem description allows for subarrays of any length from 2 to `n`, the program only considers subarrays of length 3. This might lead to missing the maximum possible value that can be achieved by considering longer subarrays.

Given the problem constraints and the operations allowed, the program's approach of considering only subarrays of length 3 is not sufficient to ensure the correct maximum value. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will find the maximum median of subarrays of length 3 to be 3, but the correct answer is 4, as shown in the example.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible subarrays and their medians.
