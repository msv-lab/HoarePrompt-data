You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: _ is t-1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if `check_all` is `True`, the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If any `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from the index where the condition was met to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will print 'YES' if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The loop will terminate after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` is true, or after checking all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it checks if the list `a` can be made non-decreasing by removing zero or one element. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array**: The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Discrepancy**: If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This identifies the point where the array deviates from being sorted.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding the discrepancy, the program splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`. It then checks two conditions:
   - All elements in the new suffix `a[i:]` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix `a[0]`.
   - The new suffix `a[i:]` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Output**: If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the array is already sorted or when the array cannot be split to form a non-decreasing sequence.

However, there is a logical issue in the program. The program only checks the first discrepancy and does not consider the possibility of multiple discrepancies. Additionally, the logic for checking the new suffix and prefix is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `check_all_new` should ensure that the new suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix, but this is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire array can be made non-decreasing.

To fix this, the program should:
- Ensure that the new suffix is sorted.
- Ensure that the last element of the new suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix.
- Ensure that the new prefix is sorted.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first discrepancy
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Split the array
                prefix = a[:i]
                suffix = a[i:]
                
                # Check if the suffix is sorted and the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix
                if all(suffix[j - 1] <= suffix[j] for j in range(1, len(suffix))) and suffix[-1] <= prefix[0]:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

```

With this correction, the program should correctly handle all cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the initial logical issue, but the corrected version is provided above).
