Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array**: The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Discrepancy**: If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This identifies the point where the array deviates from being sorted.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding the discrepancy, the program splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`. It then checks two conditions:
   - All elements in the new suffix `a[i:]` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix `a[0]`.
   - The new suffix `a[i:]` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Output**: If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the array is already sorted or when the array cannot be split to form a non-decreasing sequence.

However, there is a logical issue in the program. The program only checks the first discrepancy and does not consider the possibility of multiple discrepancies. Additionally, the logic for checking the new suffix and prefix is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `check_all_new` should ensure that the new suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix, but this is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire array can be made non-decreasing.

To fix this, the program should:
- Ensure that the new suffix is sorted.
- Ensure that the last element of the new suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the original prefix.
- Ensure that the new prefix is sorted.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the first discrepancy
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Split the array
                prefix = a[:i]
                suffix = a[i:]
                
                # Check if the suffix is sorted and the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix
                if all(suffix[j - 1] <= suffix[j] for j in range(1, len(suffix))) and suffix[-1] <= prefix[0]:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

```

With this correction, the program should correctly handle all cases.

Correctness: **False** (due to the initial logical issue, but the corrected version is provided above).
