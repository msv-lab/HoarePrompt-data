Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of splitting the array at different positions more than once to achieve a non-decreasing order. Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6
3 1 2 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, the array `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]` can be made non-decreasing by performing the following operations:
1. Split the array into `x = [3]` and `y = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, then swap them to get `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]`.
2. Split the array into `x = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]` and `y = [3]`, then swap them to get `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

However, the program only checks the first split point where the array becomes unsorted and does not consider further splits, leading to an incorrect output of "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
