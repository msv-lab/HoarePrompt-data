Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `check_all` is `True`, indicating that `a` is non-decreasing.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
