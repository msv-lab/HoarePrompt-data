Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is greater than 1, a is a list of integers read from the input, i is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise False, `new_all` is True if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise False. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
