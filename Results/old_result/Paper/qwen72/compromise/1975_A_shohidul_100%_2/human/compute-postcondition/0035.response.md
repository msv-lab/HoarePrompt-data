Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the state of the program. The values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
