To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Given State:
- `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.)
- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.)
- `n` is greater than 1 (This variable is used in the loop head and must remain greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.)
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.)
- `i` is 2 (This variable is used in the loop head and will be incremented by 1.)

### Adjustments:
- The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3**
