Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, `check_all_new` is the result of the evaluation `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`, `new_all` is the result of the evaluation `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.**
