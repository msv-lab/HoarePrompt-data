Output State: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is `n-1` if `check_all` is `False`. If any `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from the index where the condition was met to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will print 'YES' if both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The loop will terminate after the first iteration where `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` is true, or after checking all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.**
