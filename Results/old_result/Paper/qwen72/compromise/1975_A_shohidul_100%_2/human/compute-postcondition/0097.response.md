Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
2. `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is also not used in the code snippet).
3. `n` is greater than 1.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`.
6. `i` is 1.
7. `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` (which means `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`).
8. `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 1 to the end.
9. `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`.
10. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`.
11. Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both).

Given these conditions, let's analyze the implications:

- Since `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, the list `a` is not non-decreasing from index 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `new` is created by removing the first element of `a`, so `new` contains elements from index 1 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` checks if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. Given that `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, it is possible that `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, but this is not guaranteed.
- `new_all` checks if the list `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element. Since `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, and `new` starts from `a[1]`, the non-decreasing property of `new` depends on the rest of the elements in `a`.

However, the key condition is that either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both). This means that at least one of these conditions must fail, indicating that the list `a` does not meet the required criteria for being non-decreasing after removing the first element or that `a[0]` is not greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.

Given this, the code snippet:

```python
print('NO')
```

will always print 'NO' because the conditions ensure that the list `a` does not meet the required criteria.

Output: **NO**
