Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 2 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the variable `new_all` by checking if the list `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element.
- The condition `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` evaluates to `True` if for every index `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `new` (exclusive), the element at `new[i - 1]` is less than or equal to the element at `new[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
