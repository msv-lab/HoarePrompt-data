You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` remains an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` remains an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is the total number of test cases, `i` is equal to `num` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, and `op` is the total number of operations performed across all test cases. If any `num2` was greater than 10000, the loop would have broken early, but assuming it did not, `b` is the final sorted list of integers from the last `case`, `ma` is the index of the median in `b`, `median` is the original median value, and `new_median` is the final median value which is `median + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list by 1. If the length of the list exceeds 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and terminates early. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations needed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the input constraints are maintained, and the final state includes the total number of test cases processed, the last input integer, the last input string, and the total number of operations performed across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Input Size**: The program checks if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000 and prints a fixed value if true. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for large input sizes, and the solution should work for all valid input sizes (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

2. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median incorrectly. For even-length arrays, it should consider the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers one middle element. For odd-length arrays, it correctly identifies the middle element.

3. **Inefficient Median Increment**: The program increments the median element until it is greater than the current median, which is inefficient and may not always produce the correct result. The correct approach would be to increment the smallest element that is less than the next higher element in the sorted array to increase the median.

4. **Breaking the Loop Early**: The program breaks the loop after the first test case if the array length is greater than 10000, which means it will not process all test cases correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1
```

For the second test case, the program fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. The correct answer is 2, but the program outputs 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
