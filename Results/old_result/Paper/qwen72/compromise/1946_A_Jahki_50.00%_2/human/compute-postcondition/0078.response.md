The code snippet `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` calculates the value of `ma` based on the value of `num2`. The value of `ma` is determined by dividing `num2` by 2, converting the result to an integer (which truncates any decimal part), and then subtracting 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this code is `ma`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
