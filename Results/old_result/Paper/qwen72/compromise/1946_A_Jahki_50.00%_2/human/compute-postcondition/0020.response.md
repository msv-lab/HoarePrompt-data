The value of `b[ma]` is incremented by 1. The index `ma` is determined by the value of `num2`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, and if `num2` is odd, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`. Since `new_median` is equal to `median`, and `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, `new_median` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.**
