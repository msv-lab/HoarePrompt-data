To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`
- `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd
- `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`
- `b[ma]` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `num` must still be greater than `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `num` remains the same and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of iterations required to make `new_median` greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, and `b[ma]` is `median + (number of iterations - 1)`**
