The code snippet `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` processes the string `case` by splitting it into words, filtering only those words that consist entirely of digits, converting these filtered words to integers, and storing them in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `num2` is less than or equal to 10000

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000.**
