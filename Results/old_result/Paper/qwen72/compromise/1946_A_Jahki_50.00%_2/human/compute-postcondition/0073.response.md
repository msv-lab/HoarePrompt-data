The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement prints the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is an array of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) is within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `num` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.

None of these variables or conditions affect the execution of the `print(1)` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
