Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `num2 = int(input())` assigns the value of `num2` to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `num2` is an input integer, and the rest of the initial conditions remain valid.
