Postcondition: ***Given the initial conditions, if `num2` is greater than 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`. After all iterations, `op` will be equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is the minimum number of increments required to make `new_median` greater than `median`. The value of `b[ma]` will be `median + 1`, and `new_median` will be `median + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `b`, `ma`) will retain their initial values.***
