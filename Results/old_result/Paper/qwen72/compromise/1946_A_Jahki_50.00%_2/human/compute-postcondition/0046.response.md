The code snippet `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` calculates the value of `ma` based on the value of `num2`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `num2` is an input integer.
2. `int(num2 / 2)` divides `num2` by 2 and converts the result to an integer (floor division).
3. `- 1` subtracts 1 from the result of the division.

Therefore, `ma` is assigned the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
