The code snippet `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` extracts all the digits from the string `case` and converts them into integers, storing these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `num` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0

After executing the code:
- `a` is updated to a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit from the string.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0.**
