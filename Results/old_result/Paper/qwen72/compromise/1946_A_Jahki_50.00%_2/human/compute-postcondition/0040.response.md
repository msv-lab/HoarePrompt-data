Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, and `op` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `op = 0` sets the variable `op` to 0. Since `op` was initially 0, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
