The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a space-separated list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list by 1. If the length of the list exceeds 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and terminates early. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations needed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the input constraints are maintained, and the final state includes the total number of test cases processed, the last input integer, the last input string, and the total number of operations performed across all test cases.
