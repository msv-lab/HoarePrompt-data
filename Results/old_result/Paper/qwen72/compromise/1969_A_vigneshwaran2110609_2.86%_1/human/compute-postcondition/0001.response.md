The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `n` is an input integer with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, which ensures that `n` is always greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the given range. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `n` should be at least 2 to satisfy the problem constraints.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
