Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Identifying Pairs:**
   - The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` to determine if a friend and their best friend are a pair. However, this condition is incorrect. The correct condition to check if friend `i` and their best friend `p_i` form a pair is `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program uses the same variable `i` for both the outer loop ( iterating over test cases) and the inner loop ( iterating over friends). This can lead to variable shadowing and incorrect behavior.

3. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints `2` as soon as it finds a pair and breaks out of the loop. This is not always the correct answer. For example, in the second test case, the correct answer is `3`, but the program might print `2` if it finds a pair early.

4. **General Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. In such cases, the minimum number of invitations required is `3` to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        pairs = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                pairs += 1
        if pairs > 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Reading Friends and Best Friends:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - It iterates over the list `p` to count the number of pairs where `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`. This condition correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

4. **Output:**
   - If there is at least one pair, the program prints `2` because sending invitations to both friends in the pair ensures they both come to the party.
   - If there are no pairs, the program prints `3` because sending invitations to 3 friends ensures at least 2 friends come to the party.
