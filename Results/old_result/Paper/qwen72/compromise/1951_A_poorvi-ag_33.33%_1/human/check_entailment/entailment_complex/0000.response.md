Reasoning:

The provided problem description and the annotated program do not match. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that is supposed to generate Python files for HTML files in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range. However, the annotated program describes a function `func` that processes a series of test cases and evaluates strings based on the count of '1's and their adjacency.

Given this mismatch, the annotated program is not relevant to the problem description, and thus cannot be used to determine the correctness of the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

However, if we focus solely on the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and its intended functionality, we can evaluate it as follows:

1. The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is designed to:
   - Get the current working directory.
   - List all subfolders in the current directory.
   - Check if the subfolder names are numeric and fall within the specified range.
   - For each subfolder that meets the criteria, list all `.html` files.
   - Generate two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found.

2. The function appears to correctly implement the described functionality:
   - It uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current directory.
   - It uses `os.scandir()` to list all entries in the current directory and filters out directories using `f.is_dir()`.
   - It checks if the folder name is numeric and within the specified range.
   - It lists `.html` files in the subfolders that meet the criteria.
   - It generates the required files and prints the appropriate messages.

3. The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description.

Based on the above reasoning, the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` appears to be correct for the problem it is supposed to solve.

Correctness: **True**
