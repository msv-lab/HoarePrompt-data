The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints, it is expected that the function operates within the context where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and the current directory contains subfolders with numeric names. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are numeric and fall within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current directory that are numeric and fall within the range `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.**
