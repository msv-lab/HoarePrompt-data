It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct that and provide the precondition based on the problem description.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to find all subfolders in the current directory whose names are numeric and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`. For each of these subfolders, it identifies all `.html` files and generates two new files for each `.html` file: one with a `-ac.py` suffix and another with a `-wa.py` suffix.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with numeric names.**
