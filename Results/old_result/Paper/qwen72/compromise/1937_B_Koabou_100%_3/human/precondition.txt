The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n` representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
