You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input strings, each of length `n`, representing the rows of the grid. The other variables (`t`, `n`) remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` is either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` is either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` is the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index in the range `y` to `x` (exclusive) that satisfies the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` remains either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` remains either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` remains the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: [elements of s concatenated together]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either 1 or x - i + 1, depending on whether an index i is found in the range y to x (exclusive) such that a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and two binary strings of length `n` consisting of '0' or '1'. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input parameters. If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2 · 10^5, or if the binary strings are not of length `n`, the function's behavior is undefined. The specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
