To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, sep='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **List `a`**: This list remains unchanged. It is a 2D list, and its elements are not explicitly defined, but we know that it contains strings of characters, likely '0' and '1'.

2. **Variable `t`**: This variable is either 1 or `x - i + 1`, where `i` is the first index in the range `y` to `x` (exclusive) that satisfies the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`.

3. **Variable `n`**: This variable remains unchanged. It is the length of the lists in `a`.

4. **List `s`**: This list remains either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions.

5. **Variable `x`**: This variable remains either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met.

6. **Variable `y`**: This variable remains the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print(s, sep='')` statement:

- **List `s`**: The list `s` can either be empty or a modified version of `a` based on the loop conditions. The exact modification is not specified, but it depends on the values of `x` and `y` and the conditions `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` and `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`.

- **`sep=''`**: This parameter in the `print` function specifies that there should be no separator between the elements of `s` when they are printed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State of `s`**: `s` can be either an empty list or a modified version of `a`.

2. **Conditions for `s`**:
   - If `s` is empty, the `print(s, sep='')` statement will print nothing.
   - If `s` is modified, the exact modification depends on the loop conditions and the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Conditions for `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` can be `n - 1` or an index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`.
   - `y` can be an index `i` where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`, or it can be 0 if the condition was never met.

4. **Modification of `s`**:
   - The modification of `s` is based on the loop conditions, but the exact nature of the modification is not specified. However, it is clear that `s` will be a list of elements derived from `a`.

### Conclusion:

Since the exact modification of `s` is not specified, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions. If `s` is empty, nothing will be printed. If `s` is modified, it will print the elements of `s` without any separators.

Output: **s (where s is either an empty list or a modified version of list a based on the loop conditions)**

If `s` is empty, the output will be:
Output: **(empty string)**

If `s` is modified, the output will be the elements of `s` concatenated together:
Output: **[elements of s concatenated together]**
