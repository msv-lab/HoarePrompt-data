Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `p` is the element at index 2 in `l`, `q` is the element at the index `p - 1` in `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1` (which is 3), `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
