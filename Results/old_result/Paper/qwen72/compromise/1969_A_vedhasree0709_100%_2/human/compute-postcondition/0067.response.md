Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early, and `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to `q` being equal to `i + 1` at any point.***
