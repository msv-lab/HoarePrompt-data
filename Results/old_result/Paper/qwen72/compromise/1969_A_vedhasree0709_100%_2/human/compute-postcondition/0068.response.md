The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop counter is implicitly incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as the loop counter is less than the value of `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `i` is `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early
- `j` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to `q` being equal to `i + 1` at any point

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can infer that it is incremented by 1 for each iteration. The loop will execute one more time if the loop counter is less than the value of `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or the value of `i` at which `q` equals `i + 1` if the loop breaks early, `j` is 0, and `_` is incremented by 1**
