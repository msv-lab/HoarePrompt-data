Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be the smallest possible positive differences, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints the difference between them. This approach is incorrect because the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array does not necessarily represent the maximum possible beauty of the array.

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array to `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program would calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values as `3 - 1 = 2`, which is not the correct beauty value.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Given this reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
