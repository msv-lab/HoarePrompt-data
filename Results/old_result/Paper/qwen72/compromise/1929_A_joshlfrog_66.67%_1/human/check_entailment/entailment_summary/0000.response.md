Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the given program does not sort the array; instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.

The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array is indeed the maximum possible value of the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, but only if the array is sorted in a specific way. Specifically, the maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which simplifies to `max(nums) - min(nums)` because the intermediate terms cancel out.

Therefore, the program's approach of finding the maximum and minimum values and printing their difference is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
