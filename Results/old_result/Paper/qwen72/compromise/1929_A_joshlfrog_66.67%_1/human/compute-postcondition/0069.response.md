Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is `nums[2]`, `x` is the maximum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are positive, otherwise `x` remains 0. If `nums[2]` > `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[2]` and `y` is updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is not less than `nums[2]`, otherwise `y` is `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their values as described above.**
