The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. If `l` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, and `y` is 100000000**
