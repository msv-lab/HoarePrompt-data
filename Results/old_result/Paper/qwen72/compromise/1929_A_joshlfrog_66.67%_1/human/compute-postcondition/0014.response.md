Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 100000000, and `x` is set to the value of `nums[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
