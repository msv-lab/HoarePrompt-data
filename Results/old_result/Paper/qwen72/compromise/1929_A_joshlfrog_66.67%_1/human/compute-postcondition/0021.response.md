Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is `nums[2]`, and `x` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `nums[2]`.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`) retain their initial values and conditions.
