Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`. `x` is now the value of `nums[2]`. If `nums[2]` > the previous value of `x`, then `x` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = nums[i]` updates the value of `x` to the value of `nums[2]`.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is now `nums[2]`.
- If `nums[2]` is greater than the previous value of `x` (which was the greater of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` and > 0), then `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains `nums[2]`.
