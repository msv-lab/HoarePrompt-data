Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `y` is 100000000. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]`, and `x` is 0 if `nums[1]` is not greater than 0 or not greater than `x`; otherwise, `x` is set to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is not less than `y`, then `y` remains 100000000 and `x` remains 0.***
