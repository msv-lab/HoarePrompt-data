Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 500.
- The variable `e` remains 2.
- The variable `l` remains the length of the list `nums`.
- The variable `nums` remains the list of integers input by the user.
- The variable `i` is set to `l-1`, which is the last index of the list `nums`.
- The variable `x` is updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums`.
- The variable `y` is updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
