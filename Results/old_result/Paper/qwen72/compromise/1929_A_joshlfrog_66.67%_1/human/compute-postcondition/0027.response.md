Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the new `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the new `nums`.**

The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the `nums` list with new integers provided by the user. The values of `x` and `y` are then recalculated based on the new `nums` list, where `x` is the maximum value and `y` is the minimum value in the updated list. The values of `t`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged.
