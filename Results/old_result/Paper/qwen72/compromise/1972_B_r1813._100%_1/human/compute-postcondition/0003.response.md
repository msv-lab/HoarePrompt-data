Output State: **The function remains defined to accept two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The variable `input` is now set to read from `sys.stdin`. The number of test cases `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The variable `data` is a list of strings, where each string is an element from the input split by whitespace. `index` is 1.**
