The function `main` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" to represent the state of each coin (facing up or down). The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) from the input, and for each test case, it should determine and print whether Alice will win the game if both players play optimally.
