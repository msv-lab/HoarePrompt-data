Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ, `_` is incremented by 1, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` if `s1` is not equal to `t1`, otherwise no further changes occur, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of '1' characters in the string `s` and assigns this count to `s1`.
- The values of `i`, `cnt`, `_`, `d`, `n`, `s`, and `t` are not affected by this code.
- The new value of `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`.
