Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` attempts to solve the problem by checking if there is a specific pattern in the list `l` where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks for a very specific pattern and does not consider the general case where friends can come to the party if both they and their best friends receive invitations. The function will print `2` if it finds this specific pattern, and `3` otherwise, which does not necessarily correspond to the correct minimum number of invitations needed.

For example, consider the test case where `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, the function will print `3` because it does not find the specific pattern `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. However, the correct answer should be `2` because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party since they are each other's best friends.

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensure that at least one pair is invited. If there are no such pairs, the function should consider the minimum number of friends that need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
