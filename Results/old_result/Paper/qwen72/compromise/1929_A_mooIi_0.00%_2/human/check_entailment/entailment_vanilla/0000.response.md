Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for the problem specified. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - The array is sorted.
   - However, instead of calculating the beauty of the sorted array, the program prints the sorted array as a space-separated string.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The program should print the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The current program does not perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the required output.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The sum of the differences can be calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the required output.

Correctness: **False**
