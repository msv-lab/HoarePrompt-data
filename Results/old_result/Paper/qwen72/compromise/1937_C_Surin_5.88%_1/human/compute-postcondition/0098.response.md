Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 3. Otherwise, `prev` is 2 if the new `r` is '>', or `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was '>' and the new `r` is not '>', or `prev` is 0 if the previous `r` was not '>' and the new `r` is not '>'.***
