Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is 0.** 

The code initializes the variable `prev` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
