The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` is updated to the new integer value provided by the user input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 (this value will be updated)
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is the user input
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` is updated to the new integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is the user input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input, if `r` is '>', `prev` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `prev` is the last index where `r` was '>' or 0 if `r` was never '>' during the loop.**
