The code snippet provided reads a new input value for `r`. Depending on the value of `r`, the state of `prev` might change according to the conditions specified in the initial state.

- If the new `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2.
- If the new `r` is not '>', `prev` remains 1 if the previous `r` was '>', or 0 otherwise.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `r`, and potentially `prev` depending on the new value of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is 2 if the new `r` is '>', or `prev` is 1 if the previous `r` was '>' and the new `r` is not '>', or `prev` is 0 if the previous `r` was not '>' and the new `r` is not '>'.**
