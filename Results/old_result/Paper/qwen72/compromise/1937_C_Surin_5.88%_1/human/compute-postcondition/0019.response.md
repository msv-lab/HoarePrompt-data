Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 2, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, the variables retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `v1` is now 2.
