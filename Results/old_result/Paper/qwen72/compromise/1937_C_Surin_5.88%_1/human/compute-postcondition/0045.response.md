Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any of the variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged.
