Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` remains '<'.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 1 and 10^3.
- **`kp`**: Remains 2.
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`g`**: Remains 0.
- **`v1`**: After the loop completes, `v1` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop updates `v1` to `v2` whenever `r` is '<', and `v2` is set to `i` in each iteration. Since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`, the final value of `v1` will be `n-1`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- **`v2`**: Similarly, `v2` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
- **`r`**: This is the final user input received after the last iteration of the loop.
- **`prev`**: This is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop.
- **`sys.stdout.flush()`**: Ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or file immediately, and it is called in each iteration of the loop.
