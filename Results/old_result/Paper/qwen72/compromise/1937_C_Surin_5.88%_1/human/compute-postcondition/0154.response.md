Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and implicitly a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, it queries the relative order of elements in the permutation through a series of interactive questions and outputs two indices that represent a specific relationship within the permutation. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the output for each test case is flushed to the standard output. The final state of the program includes the completion of all test cases, with the last processed values of `n`, `v1`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, and `prev` reflecting the state of the last test case. **
