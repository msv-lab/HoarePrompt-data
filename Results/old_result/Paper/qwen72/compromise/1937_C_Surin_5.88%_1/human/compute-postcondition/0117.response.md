Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new user input, `prev` is the last index `i` where `r` was '>', or 0 if no `r` was ever '>' during the loop. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately. However, this does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
