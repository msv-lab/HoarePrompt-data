To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `kp` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `kp`:** This variable is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `kp` directly.

2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
- A function `I` is defined to read a list of integers from input.
- `R` is a function that reads an integer from input.

We need to ensure that the input provided to the loop (i.e., the result of `int(input())`) is at least 1, as this will determine the number of iterations.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `kp` is 0, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
