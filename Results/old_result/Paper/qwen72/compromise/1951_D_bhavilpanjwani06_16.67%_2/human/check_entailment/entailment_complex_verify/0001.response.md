### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This is a standard and correct approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which is appropriate for the problem description.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is less than `k`. If `n < k`, it correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.

4. **Exact Match Check**:
   - If `n` is exactly equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", followed by `1` (the number of stalls) and `n` (the price of the single stall). This is correct because Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall, using all her coins.

5. **Greedy Buying Strategy**:
   - If `n` is greater than `k`, the program uses the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` to decide the output. This condition can be rewritten as `2 * k - 1 < n`, which simplifies to `2 * k <= n`.
     - **Case 1**: If `2 * k <= n`, the program sets up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and another with the price `1`. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and `1` jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. This is correct.
     - **Case 2**: If `2 * k > n`, the program prints "NO" because it is not possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is also correct because if `2 * k > n`, Alice would not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys one jewel at a time from the cheapest stalls.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program adheres to the required output format for both "YES" and "NO" cases. For "YES" cases, it prints the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - When `n == k`, it sets up a single stall with the price `n`.
     - When `n < k`, it correctly identifies that it is impossible.
     - When `2 * k <= n`, it sets up two stalls with appropriate prices.

8. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- The annotations correctly describe the state and behavior of the program at each key point.
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the conditions and outputs the appropriate results.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement and adheres to the constraints and output format.

Final: **True**
