### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `n < k`**:
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for her to buy exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Case 2: `n == k`**:
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. The program correctly prints "YES" followed by `1` and `n`.
   - **Case 3: `n > k`**:
     - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is used to determine if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
     - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall. The program correctly prints "YES" followed by `2` and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - If `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, the program prints "NO". This condition is incorrect because it does not cover all possible valid configurations.

3. **Correctness of the Condition**:
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` simplifies to `2k - 1 < n`, which is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to set up the stalls.
   - The correct condition should be `k <= n`, which is already checked in the first two conditions. However, the program should be able to handle any valid `n` and `k` where `n >= k` by setting up stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Alternative Solution**:
   - A simpler and more general solution would be to always set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, as long as `n >= k`.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid cases where `n >= k` and `k <= 60`. The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is too restrictive and does not cover all possible valid configurations.

Correctness: **False**
