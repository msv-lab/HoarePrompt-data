Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Base Case 1 (n < k)**: 
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for her to buy the required number of jewels. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Base Case 2 (n == k)**:
   - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, she can buy exactly one jewel from a single stall with the price set to `n`. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value of `n`.

4. **General Case (n > k)**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is used to determine if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the program sets up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and the other with the price `1`. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - If `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, the program prints "NO". This condition is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of setting up more than two stalls to achieve the desired result.

5. **Missing Case**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` correctly. It should be possible to set up more than two stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program incorrectly prints "NO" when it should print "YES" and a valid setup of stalls.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the general case where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` by setting up more than two stalls.

Correctness: **False**
