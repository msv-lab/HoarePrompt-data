Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `k - 1` is less than the current value of `n - k + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n - k + 1, 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement outputs two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `n - k + 1` is a formula derived from the values of `n` and `k`.
   - `1` is a constant integer.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers where `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - According to the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, we can simplify this to:
     \[
     k - 1 < n - k + 1
     \]
     Adding `k - 1` to both sides:
     \[
     2k - 2 < n
     \]
     Adding 2 to both sides:
     \[
     2k < n + 2
     \]
     Dividing by 2:
     \[
     k < \frac{n + 2}{2}
     \]
     This condition ensures that `k` is less than half of `n + 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer because `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - The value of `1` is a constant integer.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer derived from the formula n - k + 1 and 1 is a constant integer)**
