The function `func_1` does not match the provided problem description. The correct function definition should be `def setup_store(t, test_cases):`. This function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function returns the results for each test case, which are not specified in the provided output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function returns the results for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided.**
