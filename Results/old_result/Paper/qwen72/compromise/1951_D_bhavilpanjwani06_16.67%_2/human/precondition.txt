The function `jewels` should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of coins Alice has (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18). The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
