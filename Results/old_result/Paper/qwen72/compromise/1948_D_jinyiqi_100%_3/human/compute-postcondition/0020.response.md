Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1, `n - j` must be greater than 1. If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing.***
