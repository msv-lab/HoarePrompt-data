Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**
