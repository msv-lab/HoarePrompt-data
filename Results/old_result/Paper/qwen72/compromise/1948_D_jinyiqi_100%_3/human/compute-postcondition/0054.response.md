Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2, and `count` is either 3, 1, or 0. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns the value of `count`. Otherwise, the program does not return `count`, and `count` remains either 3, 1, or 0 based on the initial conditions.***
