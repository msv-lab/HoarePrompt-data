Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is '?', or `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
