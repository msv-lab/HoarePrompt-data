Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a list of characters.
2. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
4. `k` is 0.
5. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
6. `s[k]` is not equal to '?'.
7. `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?'.
8. `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
9. Additionally, `count` is equal to `j`.

### Analysis:
- Since `k` is 0, `s[k]` is the first element of the list `s`.
- `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is at least 3, `j` will be a non-negative integer.
- The conditions state that `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Therefore, the condition `if s[k] is '?' or s[k + j] is '?' or s[k] is equal to s[k + j]` will evaluate to `False`.
- As a result, `count` will be set to 0.
- However, the additional condition states that `count` is equal to `j`. This means `count` is actually `j`.

### Calculation:
- `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- Since `count` is equal to `j`, `count` will be `n // 2 - 1`.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
- Substituting `count` with `j`, we get `print((n // 2 - 1) * 2)`.

### Simplification:
- `count * 2` simplifies to `(n // 2 - 1) * 2`.
- This can be further simplified to `n - 2`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the list `s`.

Output: **n - 2 (where n is the length of the list s)**
