Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2, and `count` is either 3, 1, or 0. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, `count` is either 3 or 1, depending on the initial conditions, and `count` is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
