Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. A tandem repeat is a string where the first half is identical to the second half. The program iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats in descending order, checking if a tandem repeat of that length can be formed by replacing question marks.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
   - It initializes `n` to the length of the string.
   - It iterates over possible half-lengths `j` of the tandem repeat, starting from `n // 2` down to `1`.
   - For each `j`, it initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string to check if a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` can be formed:
     - For each position `k`, it checks if `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
     - If any of these conditions are met, it increments `count`.
     - If the conditions are not met, it resets `count` to 0.
     - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` can be formed, and it prints `2 * j` and returns.
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints `0`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum length of a tandem repeat by checking all possible lengths in descending order.
   - It correctly handles the conditions for forming a tandem repeat by considering question marks and equal characters.
   - The logic of resetting `count` and checking for `count == j` ensures that the longest valid tandem repeat is found.
   - The program handles the edge case where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing `0`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks.

Correctness: **True**
