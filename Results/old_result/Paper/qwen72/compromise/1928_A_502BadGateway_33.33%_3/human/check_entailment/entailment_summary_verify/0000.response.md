Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem description requires that Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the pieces, and this can be done if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1.

To elaborate, if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle along the longer side and form a different rectangle. For example:
- For a 3 × 2 rectangle, Bob can cut it into two 3 × 1 rectangles and form a 1 × 6 rectangle.
- For a 2 × 3 rectangle, Bob can cut it into two 1 × 3 rectangles and form a 2 × 3 rectangle (which is the same as the original, but still valid according to the problem).

However, if both `a` and `b` are 1, no valid cut can be made, and thus no different rectangle can be formed. This is the only case where the output should be "No".

The original assessment suggests that the correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1. This is indeed the correct approach.

Given the function summary and the problem description, the original program's logic is flawed because it only checks if `b` is even, which does not cover all cases where Bob can form a different rectangle.

Final: **False**
