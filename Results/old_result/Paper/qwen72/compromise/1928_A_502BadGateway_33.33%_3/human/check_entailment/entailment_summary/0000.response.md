Reasoning:  
The provided program checks if the side `b` of the rectangle is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the original `a \times b` rectangle. The correct logic should consider whether either side `a` or `b` can be divided into two equal parts, and if so, whether the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

For example:
- For a `2 \times 6` rectangle, the program correctly returns 'yes' because `b` is even, and Bob can cut it into two `2 \times 3` rectangles and form a `4 \times 3` rectangle.
- For a `3 \times 2` rectangle, the program correctly returns 'yes' because `b` is even, and Bob can cut it into two `3 \times 1` rectangles and form a `1 \times 6` rectangle.
- For a `2 \times 1` rectangle, the program incorrectly returns 'no' because `b` is odd, but it should actually return 'no' because even if `a` were even, the resulting `1 \times 1` rectangles cannot form a new rectangle different from the original.

The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then Bob can form another rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Bob cannot form another rectangle.

The provided program only checks if `b` is even, which is not enough to cover all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
