Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city, but it has a logical error in its implementation. The function incorrectly calculates the cost of traveling to the closest city by comparing the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`), but it does not correctly handle the case where the closest city is the next city. Instead of setting the cost to 1 when the next city is the closest, it sets the cost to 1 for all cities except the first one, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are at the boundaries. For example, if the cities are located at `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]` and the query is `(1, 2)`, the program should return 1 coin (since the closest city to city 1 is city 2), but it will return 8 coins, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
1
1 2

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
8
```

The program incorrectly calculates the cost of traveling from city 1 to city 2 as 8 coins instead of 1 coin. This is because the `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city and its associated cost.
