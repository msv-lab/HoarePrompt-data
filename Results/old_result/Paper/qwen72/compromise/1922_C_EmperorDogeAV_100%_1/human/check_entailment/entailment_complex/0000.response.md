### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the minimum cost to travel to the next city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - It then determines the minimum cost to travel to the closest city:
     - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating the cost of traveling to the closest city).
     - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
   - The function correctly returns `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, to store the cumulative costs of traveling forward and backward, respectively.
   - It correctly computes these prefix sums:
     - `pref_sum_f` is computed for the original `forward_cities`.
     - `pref_sum_b` is computed for the reversed `backward_cities`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f` to compute the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b` to compute the cost.
   - The program correctly prints the result for each query.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the unique closest city condition.
   - The input is assumed to be valid as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between cities based on the given problem description and constraints. The use of prefix sum arrays and the function `func_1` to compute the minimum costs is appropriate and efficient.

**Correctness: True**
