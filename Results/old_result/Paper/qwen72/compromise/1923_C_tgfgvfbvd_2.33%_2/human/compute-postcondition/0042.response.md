Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m`, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`. For each iteration from 0 to `m-1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `m` iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed its full set of iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are determined by user input, and the conditions inside the loop are evaluated accordingly, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions.
