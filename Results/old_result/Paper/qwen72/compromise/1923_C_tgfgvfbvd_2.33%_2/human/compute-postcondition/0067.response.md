To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is `m + 1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains the value of `p[b - 1]`.
- Either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 times `(b - a + 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `_`**: This variable is set to `m + 1`, where `m` is greater than 0. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

2. **Variables `a` and `b`**: These are input integers. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, but they are used to determine the value of `s`.

3. **Variable `s`**:
   - If `a` is at least 2, `s` is calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - If `a` is less than 2, `s` is simply the value of `p[b - 1]`.

4. **Condition**:
   - The condition states that either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 times `(b - a + 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement is `print('NO')`. This statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, or any other variables. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
