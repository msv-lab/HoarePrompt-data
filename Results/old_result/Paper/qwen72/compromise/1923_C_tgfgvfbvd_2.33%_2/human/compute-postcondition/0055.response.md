The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing `[c, c + l[1]]`, `c` is now `c + l[1] + l[2]`, `x` is the third element in `l`.**
