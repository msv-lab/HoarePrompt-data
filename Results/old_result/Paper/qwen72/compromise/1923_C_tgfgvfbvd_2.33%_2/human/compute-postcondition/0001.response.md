The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`, respectively.

- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` is 0.
- After executing the code, `n` and `m` are assigned new values based on the user's input, which are converted to integers.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input.**
