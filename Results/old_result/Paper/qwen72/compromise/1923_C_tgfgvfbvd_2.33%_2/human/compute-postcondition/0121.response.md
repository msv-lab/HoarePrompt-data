The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 2
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space
- `l` is a list of integers from the input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`
- `x` is the last element of the list `l`
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`
- If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new input integers.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the new input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`, if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
