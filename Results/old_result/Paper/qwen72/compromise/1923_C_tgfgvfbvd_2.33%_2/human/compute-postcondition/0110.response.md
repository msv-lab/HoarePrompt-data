Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - `x` is the last element of the list `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
   - Additionally, either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('NO')` statement.

Given the conditions and the initial state, the `print('NO')` statement will always execute because the conditions do not affect the print statement directly. The conditions only update the value of `s` and check certain inequalities, but they do not change the fact that the `print('NO')` statement will be executed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
