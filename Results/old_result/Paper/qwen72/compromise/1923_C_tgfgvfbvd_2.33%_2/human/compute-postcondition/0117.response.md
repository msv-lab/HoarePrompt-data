Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `_` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- `x` is the last element of the list `l`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
