Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `p` is a list containing `[c]`, `c` is now `c + l[1]`, `x` is the second element in `l`.** 

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated to `c + l[1]`, where `l[1]` is the second element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
