The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `m` are integers based on user input
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`
- `m` must be greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the variables `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input.**
