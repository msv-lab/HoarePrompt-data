To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `a` and `b` are new input integers.
   - `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - `x` is the last element of the list `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints 'YES'.

Given the conditions, the print statement will always print 'YES' if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is met. However, since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine if the condition is met or not. But the print statement itself is unconditional and will always print 'YES' if the condition is met.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
