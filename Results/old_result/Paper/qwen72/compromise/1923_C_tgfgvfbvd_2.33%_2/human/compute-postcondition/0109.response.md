Postcondition: ***_ is 0, m is greater than 0, a and b are input integers, n and m are now the integers from the input split by space, l is a list of integers from the input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element of the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is updated to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains unchanged. Additionally, either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1, or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).***
