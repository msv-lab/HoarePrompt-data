The code `p.append(c)` adds the current value of `c` to the end of the list `p`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `p` initially contains two elements: `[c, c + l[1]]`.
- `c` was updated to `c + l[1] + l[2]` before this code executes.
- After executing `p.append(c)`, the list `p` will contain three elements: `[c, c + l[1], c + l[1] + l[2]]`.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing `[c, c + l[1], c + l[1] + l[2]]`, `c` is now `c + l[1] + l[2]`, `x` is the third element in `l`.**
