Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is set to 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, with `m` being greater than 1.
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers based on user input.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is set to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are all defined based on the initial state.
   - The specific values of these variables are not directly relevant to the `print` statement, as the `print` statement does not reference any of them.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
