Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `s` is now specifically `p[b - 1]`.
