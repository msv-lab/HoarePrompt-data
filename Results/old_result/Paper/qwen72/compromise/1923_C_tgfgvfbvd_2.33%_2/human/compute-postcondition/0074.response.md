To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `s` is initially set to `p[b - 1]`.
- If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`.
- If `a` is less than 2, `s` remains `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- The condition `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` may no longer hold.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `s`:**
   - `s` starts as `p[b - 1]`.

2. **Update of `s` based on `a`:**
   - If `a` is at least 2, `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`.
   - If `a` is less than 2, `s` remains `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` may no longer hold. This means that after the update of `s`, the condition might not be satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, or any other variables. The condition mentioned in the initial state does not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
