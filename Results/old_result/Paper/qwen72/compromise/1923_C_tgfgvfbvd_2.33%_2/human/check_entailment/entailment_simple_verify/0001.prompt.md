You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers based on user input, l is a list of integers based on user input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in l. For each of the m queries, a and b are integers based on user input. If a - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, s is equal to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s remains equal to p[b - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula \( \text{sum}(l[i:j]) = p[j-1] - p[i-1] \).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[a-1:b]`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums: `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise `s = p[b-1]`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray must be greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: The subarray length must be greater than 1. This ensures that there are at least two elements in the subarray, which is necessary to find a different array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `a`.
- **Condition 2**: The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to construct a different array `b` with positive elements that sum to the same value as `a`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray has only one element or when the sum of the subarray is too small to satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
