The value of `res` is incremented by the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, which calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. The value of `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `res` is incremented by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
