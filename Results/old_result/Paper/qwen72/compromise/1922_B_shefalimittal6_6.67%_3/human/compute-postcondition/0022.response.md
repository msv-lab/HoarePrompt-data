Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `res` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be updated to the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res`.
- If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`) retain their initial values.
