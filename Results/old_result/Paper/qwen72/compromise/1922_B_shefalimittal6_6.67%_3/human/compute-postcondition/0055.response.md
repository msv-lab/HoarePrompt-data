To adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- `cnt`: The current value being iterated over.
- `num_of_lens`: The dictionary whose values are being iterated over.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `res` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the dictionary `num_of_lens` must still have at least one more value to iterate over. The variable `cnt` will be the next value in the iteration.

Step-by-step adjustment:
1. `cnt` will be the next value in the iteration of `num_of_lens.values()`.
2. `num_of_lens` must still have at least one more value to iterate over, meaning it must have at least two key-value pairs for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `res` is 0. If the next `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. If the next `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.**
