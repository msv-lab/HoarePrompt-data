The only objects in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, meaning there must be at least one integer in `nums` that has a count. For the loop to be executed, `num_of_lens` must have at least one entry, and `cnt` will be the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must have at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens`**
