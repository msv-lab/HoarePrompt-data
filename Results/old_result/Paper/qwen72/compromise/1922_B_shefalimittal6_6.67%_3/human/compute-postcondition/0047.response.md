To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

1. **`cnt`**: This variable will take on the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`'s values. It is not something we need to adjust directly, as it will be assigned by the loop.

2. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. If `num_of_lens` is empty, the loop will not run.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0**
