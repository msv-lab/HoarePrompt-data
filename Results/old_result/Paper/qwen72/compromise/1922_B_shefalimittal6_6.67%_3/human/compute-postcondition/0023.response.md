Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `res` remains 0. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains 0.***
