The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This action does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `res` is calculated based on the counts of integers in `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values, where combinations of 3 are added directly to `res` if the count is 3 or more, and combinations of 2 are multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added to `res` if the count is 2 or more.**
