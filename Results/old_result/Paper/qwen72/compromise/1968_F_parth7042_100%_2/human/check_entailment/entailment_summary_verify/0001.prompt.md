You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero or if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i < j ≤ r` and the XOR of the subarray `a[i+1]` to `a[j]` is zero. If either condition is met, the function appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results, with each result on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for handling large inputs efficiently.
   - The index variable is used to track the current position in the input list, which is incremented as elements are read.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1`.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding segments with the same XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be split into segments where each segment's XOR is `0`, making the subarray interesting. In this case, the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and both indices are within the bounds of the subarray. This check is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the positions in the lists stored in `mp`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated and stored. This allows for efficient XOR calculations for any subarray.
  - The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices of each prefix XOR value, which is useful for checking the existence of valid segments.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is `0`, which is a sufficient condition for the subarray to be interesting.
  - For the case where the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are valid indices in the lists stored in `mp` that can form the required segments. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the positions of the indices.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the subarray is not interesting by checking the conditions on the indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The prefix XOR array and the dictionary `mp` are constructed in linear time, and each query is processed in logarithmic time using binary search.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.
