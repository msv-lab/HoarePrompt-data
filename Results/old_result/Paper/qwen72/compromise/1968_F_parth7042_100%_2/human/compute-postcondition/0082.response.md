Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains incremented by 1.
- `t` is still the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`.
- `n` is still the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `q` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is still increased by 2.
- `a` is now a list with a length of `n + 1`, and all elements in the list are set to 0.
