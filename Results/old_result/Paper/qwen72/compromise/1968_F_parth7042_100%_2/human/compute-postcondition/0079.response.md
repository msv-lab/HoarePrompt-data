Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The new state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged conditions for `_` and `t`.
