Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` iterations have completed, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is assigned the integer value of `data[index]` at the corresponding iteration, `index` is increased by `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, and `mp` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding list contains the indices where that value appears in `pf`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index `it1` in `v1` is less than the element at index `it2` in `v2`, then `results` now contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now contains the string 'NO' at the end. Additionally, in the 'NO' case, either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`q` is greater than 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the appended element is 'YES'. Otherwise, the appended element is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is assigned the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the appended element is 'YES'. Otherwise, the appended element is 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
