Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`. If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- `q` remains greater than 0.
- `l` is now the integer value of `data[index - 6]` because `index` was increased by 2.
- `r` is now the integer value of `data[index - 4]` because `index` was increased by 2.
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`.
- If `x` is 0, `results` has a new element 'YES' appended to it, and the program continues to the next iteration.
