Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so the new value of `index` is `2 * q + 2`.
- The values of `q`, `results`, `_`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
