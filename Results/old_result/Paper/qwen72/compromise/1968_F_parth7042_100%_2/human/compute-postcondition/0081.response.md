Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2.** 

The value of `index` is increased by 2, while the values of `_`, `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. The conditions that `t` must be greater than `_` and that `n` and `q` are derived from `data` based on the updated `index` are still valid.
