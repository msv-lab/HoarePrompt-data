Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.**

Explanation:
- The code `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a new list `pf` with length `n + 1`, where all elements are set to 0.
- The values of `q`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The new list `pf` is now a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
