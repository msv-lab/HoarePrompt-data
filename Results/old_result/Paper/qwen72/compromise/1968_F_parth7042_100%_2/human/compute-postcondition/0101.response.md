Output State: **`n` iterations have completed, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is assigned the integer value of `data[index]` at the corresponding iteration, `index` is increased by `n`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, and `mp` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding list contains the indices where that value appears in `pf`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has run `n` times, where `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` from the initial state.
- The variable `i` is now `n`.
- The list `a` has been filled with the integer values from `data` starting from `data[index]` up to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- The variable `index` has been incremented by `n` (the number of iterations).
- The list `pf` now contains the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to each index `i`.
- The defaultdict `mp` contains keys that are the values from `pf`, and the corresponding lists contain the indices where those values appear in `pf`.
