Output State: **`_` is incremented by `q`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `3 + n + 2 * q`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[3 + i - 1]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `pf` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `mp` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `mp[0]` now contains the list `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the list `[i]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `q` iterations, depending on the conditions within the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `q` times, so the variable `_` (which is the loop counter) is incremented by `q`.
- The `index` variable is updated by `2 * q` because for each iteration, `index` is incremented by 2 to move to the next pair of `l` and `r` values in the `data` list.
- The `results` list is populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `q` iterations based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration:
  - `l` and `r` are read from the `data` list.
  - `x` is calculated as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
  - `v1` and `v2` are the lists from `mp` corresponding to `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, respectively.
  - `it1` and `it2` are the indices in `v1` and `v2` where the first element is greater than or equal to `l` and the last element is less than `r`, respectively.
  - If `x` is 0, 'YES' is appended to `results`.
  - If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`.
  - Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.

All other variables (`t`, `data`, `test_cases`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
