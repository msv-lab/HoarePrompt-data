You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, `n` and `q` satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, respectively, and for each query, `l` and `r` satisfy 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The elements of `a` are integers in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, `index` is `3 * t + 2 * (sum of all `n` values) + 2 * (sum of all `q` values)`, `results` is a list of length `sum of all `q` values` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each query iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of 'YES' or 'NO' in the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of the list.
    #   - The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, corresponding to the elements in the `results` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of integers, and a list of `q` queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output for a specific test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
