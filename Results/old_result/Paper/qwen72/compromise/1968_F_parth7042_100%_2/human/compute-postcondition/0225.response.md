Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The loop has completed all `t` iterations.
   - `index` is calculated as `3 * t + 2 * (sum of all `n` values) + 2 * (sum of all `q` values)`.
   - `results` is a list of length equal to the sum of all `q` values.
   - Each element in the `results` list is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each query iteration.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each query iteration.
   - The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of 'YES' or 'NO' in the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of the list.
   - The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, corresponding to the elements in the `results` list.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each query iteration, and each element is on a new line)**
