The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is incremented by `q`, and `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `_` by 1 each time), and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Given that `_` was incremented by `q` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `t` must be greater than this new value of `_`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than `_`**
