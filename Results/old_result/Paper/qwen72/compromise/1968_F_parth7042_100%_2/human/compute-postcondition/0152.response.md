Output State: **`q` iterations have completed, `index` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `_` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

The value of `n` is now the integer value of the element in the `data` list at the position `index`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
