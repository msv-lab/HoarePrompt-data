The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the second integer from `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` and `k` must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
