Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the result. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The function then generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, with any remaining positions filled with 0. If the sum of the generated powers of 2 is less than `k`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the total sum equals `k`. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. **
