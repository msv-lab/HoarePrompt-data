Output State: **`i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` if `k` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` shifted right by 1 bit, and then shifted right by another 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
