The variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the second integer from `l1` shifted right by 1 bit, and then shifted right by another 1 bit. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state of `k` must be such that it is non-zero. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` if `k0` was an odd number before the shift, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`, and `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`**
