Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the number of bits in the original `k`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `k0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list and `c` is 1.**
