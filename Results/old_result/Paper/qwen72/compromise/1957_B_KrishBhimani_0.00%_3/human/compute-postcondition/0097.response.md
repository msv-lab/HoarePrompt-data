Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr` (which is 0), `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1`, and if `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop finishes, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. `ans` is extended by appending zeros until its length equals `n`. `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `k0`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- `arr` is now an empty list, so `c` (the number of elements in `arr`) is 0.
- Since `arr` is empty, `ans` will also be an empty list or will contain only zeros, depending on the value of `n`.
- The condition for appending values to `ans` (`c` equals `n - 1`) is not met because `c` is 0.
- The last element in `ans` will not be modified because `arr` is empty and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.
- `l1` remains a list of strings obtained from the input.
