Output State: **`i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0 - 0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list.**
