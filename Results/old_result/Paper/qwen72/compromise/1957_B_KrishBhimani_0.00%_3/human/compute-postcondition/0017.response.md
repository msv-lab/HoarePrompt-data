The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must remain non-zero.

Since `k` is right-shifted by 2 bits, it means that the original value of `k` (which is `k0` right-shifted by 2 bits) must have been such that after the right shift, it is still non-zero. Therefore, `k0` must be greater than 3 (since 4 right-shifted by 2 bits is 1, and any number less than 4 would result in 0 or a negative number after right-shifting by 2 bits, which would not satisfy the loop condition).

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than 3, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]`**
