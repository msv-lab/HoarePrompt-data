Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns `arr` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `k0`, `int(input())`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
