The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `c` is now 3, the condition `c == n - 1` might be met, but this is not specified in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 3, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `1 << i` and `1 << i`.**
