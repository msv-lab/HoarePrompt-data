The value of `k` is updated by right-shifting it by 1 bit. Since `k` was originally the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, the new value of `k` will be the original second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 3 bits. The original `k` was either odd or even, which determined the value of `arr`. The new value of `k` will be half of its previous value, but it will still be non-zero. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 3 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than 3, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is `[1, 2]`. If the original `k` was even, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.**
