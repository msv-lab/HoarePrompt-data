Postcondition: ***`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `1 << i` and `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to contain three elements: `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - (1 << i) - (1 << i)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
