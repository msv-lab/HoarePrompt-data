Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `1 << i` and `1 << i`.**

The value `1 << i` is appended to the list `ans`, which already contained `1 << i`. Therefore, `ans` now has two elements, both of which are `1 << i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
