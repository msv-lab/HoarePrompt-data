Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `c` is 2, `ans` now contains the element `1 << i` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation:
- The value of `1 << i` is calculated and appended to the list `ans`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `k0`, `l1`, `int(input())`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` is updated to reflect that it now contains the element `1 << i` appended to its previous contents.
