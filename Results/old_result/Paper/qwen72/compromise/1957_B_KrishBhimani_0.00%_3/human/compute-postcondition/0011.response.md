Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 1 bit, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
