Output State: **`i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, and `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `1 << i` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is the second element in `arr`, and the bitwise left shift operation `1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, effectively multiplying 1 by 2 raised to the power of `i`. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, and `c`) remain unchanged. The condition `if c == n - 1` is not checked in this code snippet, so the list `ans` is updated to contain the value `1 << i`.
