Output State: **The program returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either -1 or the number of ties (equalities) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and the number of ties is determined based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
