### Reasoning:

1. **Total Points and Parity Check**:
   - The total points scored by the three players must be even because each game contributes a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores, and the function correctly appends `-1` to the results list.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches played is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.
   - The function checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. This condition is not entirely accurate:
     - `total_matchs > 3` is not a valid constraint. The number of matches can be greater than 3. For example, if the scores are (6, 6, 6), the total points are 18, and the total matches are 9, which is valid.
     - `p3 > total_matchs` is a valid constraint because the highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is used to calculate the number of draws.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest score and the other scores should be accounted for by wins and losses. The remaining points should be from draws.
   - If `egalites < 0`, it means the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and the function correctly appends `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2`, which is the correct way to calculate the number of draws since each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no games were played (e.g., (0, 0, 0)) correctly by returning 0.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent (e.g., (1, 1, 10)) correctly by returning -1.

### Conclusion:
The function is mostly correct, but the condition `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed. The correct condition should only check if `p3 > total_matchs`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    return resultats
```

This fix ensures that the function correctly handles all valid and invalid cases.
