You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list of integers, each either -1 or the number of ties (egalites) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test` based on the loop's conditions.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either -1 or the number of ties (equalities) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and the number of ties is determined based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to a tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 if the conditions for calculating ties are not met, or the number of ties (equalities) calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop. The conditions for calculating ties include: the total points (sum of p_1, p_2, and p_3) being even, the total matches (half of total points) being 3 or less, and p_3 not exceeding the total matches. If these conditions are met, the number of ties is calculated and appended to `resultats`; otherwise, -1 is appended.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of matches is greater than 3. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect because the maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is not limited to 3. For example, if the scores are (3, 4, 5), the total points are 12, which means 6 matches were played (since each match awards 2 points). However, the program incorrectly returns -1 for this case, even though it is a valid set of scores that can be achieved with 6 matches, including 6 draws. The correct condition should be `if p3 > total_matchs:` to ensure that the highest score does not exceed the total number of matches played.
