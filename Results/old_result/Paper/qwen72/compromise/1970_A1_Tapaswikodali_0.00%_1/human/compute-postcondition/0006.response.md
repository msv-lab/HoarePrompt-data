Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples of the form (balance, -i, char) sorted in reverse order of the original string `s`; `result` is the same as the original string `s` but in reverse order.**

The code snippet creates a new string `result` by joining the `char` elements from the tuples in the `details` list. Since `details` contains tuples sorted in reverse order of the original string `s`, the `result` string will be the reverse of `s`. The other variables (`s`, `balance`, and `details`) remain unchanged.
