Output State: **The `trumps` list will be empty if there were enough trump cards to match all remaining ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The `answers` list will contain strings representing the pairs of cards that were matched and removed from the `suits` dictionary, sorted by rank. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for any suit that had a pair of cards removed, and the remaining unmatched card ranks for the other suits. If there were not enough trump cards, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return, leaving the `trumps` list with the remaining trump cards and the `answers` list with the matched pairs up to that point.**
