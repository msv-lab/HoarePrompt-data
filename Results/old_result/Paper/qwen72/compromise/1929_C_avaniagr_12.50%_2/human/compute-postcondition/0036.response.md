Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `a` >= `x` + 1, the condition is met, otherwise, the condition is not met.***
