Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from user input. The function then evaluates whether `a` meets certain conditions relative to `k` and `x`. If `x` is less than `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, or if `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, or if `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to a computed value `z`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
