Output State: **`i` is 1, `x + 1` is greater than 1, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The condition `x + 1` is greater than 1 is still valid and unchanged.
- The value of `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. This means `z` is incremented by the integer division of `z` by `k - 1` plus 1. The exact new value of `z` depends on the initial value of `z` and the value of `k`, but the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` accurately represents the updated value of `z`.
