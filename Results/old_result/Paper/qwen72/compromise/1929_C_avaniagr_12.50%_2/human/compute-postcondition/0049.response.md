Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `z` is calculated as \(z = x + 1 + x // (k - 1)\).
   - `i` is set to `x`.
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for the variables, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is not conditional and does not use any of the variables in its output, it will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
