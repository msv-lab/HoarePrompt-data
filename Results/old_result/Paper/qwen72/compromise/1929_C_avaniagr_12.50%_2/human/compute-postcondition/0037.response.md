The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Determination of Output:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `_`.
   - The condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the initial state.

Output: **YES**
