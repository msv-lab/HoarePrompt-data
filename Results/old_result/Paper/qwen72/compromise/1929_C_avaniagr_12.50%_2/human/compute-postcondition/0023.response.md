Output State: **`i` is 2, `x + 1` is greater than 2, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition `x + 1` is greater than 2 is still valid and has not been affected by the code.
- The value of `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. This means `z` is incremented by the integer division of `z` by `k - 1`, plus 1. The exact new value of `z` depends on the current values of `z` and `k`, but the expression for the update is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
