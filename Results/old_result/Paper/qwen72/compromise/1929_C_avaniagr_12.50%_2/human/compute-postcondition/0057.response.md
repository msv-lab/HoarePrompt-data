Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Counter `_`**:
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1. This means that `_` is increased by 1 from its initial value.
   - If the initial value of `_` is 0, then after incrementing, `_` becomes 1.
   - If the initial value of `_` is 1, then after incrementing, `_` becomes 2.
   - And so on.

2. **Condition `t > _`**:
   - The condition states that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
   - Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `_` is incremented by 1, the new value of `_` will be at least 1.
   - Therefore, as long as `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, the condition will be satisfied.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute if the condition `t > _` is true.
   - Given that `t` is at least 1 and `_` is incremented by 1, the condition `t > _` will be true for the first iteration of the loop (assuming `_` starts at 0).

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES' if the condition `t > _` is true. Since the initial state guarantees that `t` is at least 1 and `_` is incremented by 1, the condition will be true for the first iteration.

Output: **YES**
