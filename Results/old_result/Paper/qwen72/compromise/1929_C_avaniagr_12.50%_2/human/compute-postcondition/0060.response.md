The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, but this increment is not relevant to the `print` statement since `_` is not used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or the loop counter `_`.

Output: **YES**
