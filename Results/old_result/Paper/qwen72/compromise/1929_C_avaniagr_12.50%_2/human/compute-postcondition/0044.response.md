Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1), `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `z` is 1. The expression `z // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `z` by `k - 1`. Since `z` is 1, the result of `1 // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any `k` greater than 1. Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `2`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
