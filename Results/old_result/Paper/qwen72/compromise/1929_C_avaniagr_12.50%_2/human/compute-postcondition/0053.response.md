Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `x` == `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, the condition `a >= x + 3` holds; otherwise, the condition `a < x + 3` holds. If `x` != `k - 1`, then `z` is set to `x + 1` + `x` // (`k - 1`), and `i` is set to `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the condition `a >= z` holds; otherwise, the condition `a < z` holds.***
