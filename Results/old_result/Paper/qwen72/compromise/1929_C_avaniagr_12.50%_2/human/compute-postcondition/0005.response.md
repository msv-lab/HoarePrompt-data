Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
