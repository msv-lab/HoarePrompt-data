The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state provided already ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it will be assigned by the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
