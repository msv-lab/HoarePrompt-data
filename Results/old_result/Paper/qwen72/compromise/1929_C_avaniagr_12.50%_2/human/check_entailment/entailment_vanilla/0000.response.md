Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Casino Rules**:
   - If Sasha bets \( y \) coins and wins, he gets \( y \cdot k \) coins.
   - If Sasha loses, he loses \( y \) coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Sasha starts with \( a \) coins.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \) and then determines if Sasha can achieve the objective.

#### Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)
- If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always place a bet of 1 coin after each loss.
- After \( x \) losses, he will have \( a - x \) coins left.
- On the next bet, he will win \( 1 \cdot k = k \) coins, increasing his total to \( a - x + k \).
- Since \( k > x + 1 \), \( a - x + k \) will always be greater than \( a \), and he can continue this strategy to increase his coins indefinitely.

#### Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)
- If \( x = k - 1 \), Sasha can lose \( k - 1 \) times in a row.
- After \( k - 1 \) losses, he will have \( a - (k - 1) \) coins left.
- On the next bet, he will win \( 1 \cdot k = k \) coins, increasing his total to \( a - (k - 1) + k = a + 1 \).
- To ensure he can continue this strategy, he needs at least \( x + 3 \) coins initially to cover the worst-case scenario of losing \( k - 1 \) times and then winning once.

#### Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)
- If \( x > k - 1 \), Sasha can lose more than \( k - 1 \) times in a row.
- The program uses a loop to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins once.
- The loop calculates the total number of coins \( z \) needed to guarantee a win after \( x \) losses.
- If \( a \geq z \), Sasha can achieve the objective; otherwise, he cannot.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
   - The condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) ensures that Sasha has enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin after \( x \) losses.
   - This is correct because after \( x \) losses, he will have \( a - x \) coins, and he can place a bet of 1 coin, which will result in \( a - x + k \) coins, which is always greater than \( a \).

2. **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
   - The condition \( a \geq x + 3 \) ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing \( k - 1 \) times and then winning once.
   - This is correct because after \( k - 1 \) losses, he will have \( a - (k - 1) \) coins, and he needs at least 3 more coins to place a bet of 1 coin and then another bet of 1 coin after winning.

3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
   - The loop calculates the total number of coins \( z \) needed to guarantee a win after \( x \) losses.
   - The loop logic is incorrect. It should calculate the total number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of losing \( x \) times in a row and then winning once.
   - The correct calculation should be \( z = a + (x + 1) \cdot (k - 1) \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = a + (x + 1) * (k - 1)
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the loop for the case \( x > k - 1 \). The loop does not correctly calculate the total number of coins needed to guarantee a win after \( x \) losses. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
