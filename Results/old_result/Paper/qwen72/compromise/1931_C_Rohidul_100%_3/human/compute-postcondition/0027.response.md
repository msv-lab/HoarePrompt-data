Postcondition: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `n > st`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and the first `st` elements of `a` must be equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `st - 1`, `r` is `l` or `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list `a`, `end` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list `a` plus 1, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
