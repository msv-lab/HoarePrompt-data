The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `lst` contains at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`. The condition about the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` being equal to `mini` does not affect the execution of the provided code snippet. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition is met, `elem` is appended to `final`.

Output State: **`lst` contains at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `final` now includes `elem`.**
