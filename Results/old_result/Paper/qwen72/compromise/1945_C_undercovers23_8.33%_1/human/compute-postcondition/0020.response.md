Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
