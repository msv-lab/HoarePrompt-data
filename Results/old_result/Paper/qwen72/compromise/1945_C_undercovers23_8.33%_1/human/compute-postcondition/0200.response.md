The code snippet `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. This operation modifies the `final` list but does not affect the state of any other variables. 

Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, sorted in ascending order. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, `c1`) remains unchanged.**
