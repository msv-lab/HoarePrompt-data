Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `n` is an odd integer, `pk` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
