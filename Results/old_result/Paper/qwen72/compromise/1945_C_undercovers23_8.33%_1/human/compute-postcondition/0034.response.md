To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is 100,000,000
- `i` is 1
- `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0'; otherwise, `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1'
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- If `zero_perc` is at least 50% and `one_perc` is at least 50%, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 if `s[2]` is '0'; otherwise, `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1 if `s[2]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 2 if `s[2]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50% and `one_perc` is at least 50%, `lst` is `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
