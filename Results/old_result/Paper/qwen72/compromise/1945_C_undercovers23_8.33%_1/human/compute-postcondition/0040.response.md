Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, `zero` is the same as before, `one` is the same as before, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` now includes the value `i + 1` (which is 3).**
