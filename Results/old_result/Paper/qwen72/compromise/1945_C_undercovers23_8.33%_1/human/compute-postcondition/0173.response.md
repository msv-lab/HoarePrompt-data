Output State: **`zero` is `zero + 1`, `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zero` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 1))`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`.
