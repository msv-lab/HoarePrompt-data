Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst` contains at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` now includes `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` contains at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` now includes `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`lst` contains at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` now includes `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
