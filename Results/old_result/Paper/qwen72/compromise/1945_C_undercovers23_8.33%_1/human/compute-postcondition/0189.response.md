To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `lst`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `zero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`
- `one` is the number of '1's in the string `s`
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution
- `ele` is the last element in `lst`
- `final` is an empty list
- `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`

For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The variable `elem` will take on the values from `lst` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lst` is not empty and `elem` is set to the first element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`**
