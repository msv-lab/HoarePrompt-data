Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `final` contains `[0]`, sorted in ascending order, but the length of `final` is 1. The state of other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`) remains unchanged, except `c1` which is now equal to `o * 100 // n`. Additionally, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
