Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` now contains `n` and the length of `final` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`mini`**: After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the smallest value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
- **`final`**: The list `final` will contain the elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is exactly equal to `mini`. If no such elements exist, `final` will be empty, and `c1` will be calculated as `o * 100 // n`. Depending on the value of `c1`, `final` will either contain one element (if `c1` is >= 50) or `n` (if `c1` is < 50).
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
