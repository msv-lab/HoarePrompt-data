Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the new `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in the new `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0, otherwise `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / (i + 1))` if `s[i]` is '0' and `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (i + 1))` otherwise. `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. `lst` is an empty list, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` (the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the integer `0`. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the integer `n`. Additionally, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1].***
