To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Objects in the Loop Head**: The only object in the loop head is `elem`, which is an element of the list `lst`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

### Current State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`
- `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`
- `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`
- `mini` is the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration
- `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- `lst` must have at least one element
- `final` is a list containing the element `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`elem`**: This variable will be updated to the next element in `lst` for the next iteration.
- **`lst`**: The list `lst` must still have elements remaining for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
Since the loop head only involves `elem` and `lst`, and the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `lst`, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the input string `s`, `o` is the number of times the character '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times the character '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the last iteration, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the element `elem` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.**
