The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter, and the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state given includes the constraints on `t`, but for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 (though the actual value of `_` is not significant as it's a placeholder)**
