The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variables `n` and `a` are also not directly used in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_j is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
