Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the first and second elements of `a` or the last and second-to-last elements of `a` meet specific conditions. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
