You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without modifying the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled by the line `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times to handle each test case. This is done with the line `for i in range(t):`.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input. This is correctly handled by the line `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither condition is met, the program outputs "NONE". This is correctly handled by the `else` block.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "STAIRS" if the digits form a stair. However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S').
   - The program prints "PEAK" if the digits form a peak, which is correct.
   - The program prints "NONE" if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, which is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., 0 0 0), which should output "NONE".
   - The program also correctly handles the edge case where the digits are in a non-stair and non-peak order (e.g., 4 1 7), which should output "NONE".

Given the above reasoning, the only issue is the output for a stair, which should be "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS".
