The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9), and returns a result for each test case.**
