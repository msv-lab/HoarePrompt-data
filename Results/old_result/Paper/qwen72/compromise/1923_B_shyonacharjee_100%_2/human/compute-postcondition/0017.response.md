Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by the absolute value of the first element in the tuple and must have at least 2 tuples, `bullets_used` is `health`, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `can_survive` is True**

Explanation:
- The value of `distance` is updated to the absolute value of `pos`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid.
