Output State: **The loop will have executed t times, and for each iteration, it will have read three integers a, b, c from the input. Depending on the values of a, b, and c, it will have printed 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if b is the maximum of a, b, and c, and 'NONE' in all other cases. The values of a, b, and c will be overwritten in each iteration, so their final values will be the ones from the last iteration.**
