You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed t times, and for each iteration, it will have read three integers a, b, c from the input. Depending on the values of a, b, and c, it will have printed 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if b is the maximum of a, b, and c, and 'NONE' in all other cases. The values of a, b, and c will be overwritten in each iteration, so their final values will be the ones from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits form a peak but the peak is not centered at `b`. For example, if the input is `3 4 1`, the program will incorrectly output "PEAK" because it checks if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, according to the problem description, a peak should satisfy the condition `a < b > c`, and `3 4 1` does not satisfy this condition because `3 < 4 > 1` is not true. The correct output for `3 4 1` should be "NONE".
