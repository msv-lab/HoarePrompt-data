Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` (which is `x - 2`).
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `max_sum` and `best_y` are still in effect, but no change occurs in this snippet.
