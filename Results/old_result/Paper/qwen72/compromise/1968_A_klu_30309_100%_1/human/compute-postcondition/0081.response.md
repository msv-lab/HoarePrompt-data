Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` remains 0, and `best_y` remains 1.**

The code appends the current value of `best_y` (which is 1) to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged.
