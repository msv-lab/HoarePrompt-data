Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2`**

Explanation:
- The code `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is already `x - 2`, `best_y` is also `x - 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that `best_y` is `x - 2`.
