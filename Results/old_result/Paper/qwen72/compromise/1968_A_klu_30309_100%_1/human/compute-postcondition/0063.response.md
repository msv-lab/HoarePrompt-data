Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than the current value of `max_sum`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to be equal to the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
