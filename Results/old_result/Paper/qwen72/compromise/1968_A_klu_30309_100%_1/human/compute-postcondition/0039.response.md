The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` is the second integer in the list `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, and `x` must remain the same. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
