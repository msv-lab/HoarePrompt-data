To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `x` must be at least 2. Given that `x` is the third integer in the list `test_cases` and each integer in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `x` is already guaranteed to be at least 2. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `y` is initialized correctly.

The loop starts with `y` set to `x - 1` and decrements `y` by 1 until `y` is greater than 0. So, `y` should be initialized to `x - 1` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1**
