Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2`**. 

The value of `max_sum` has been updated to `gcd_val + y`, and the value of `best_y` remains `x - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
