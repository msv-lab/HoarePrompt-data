Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`. If during any iteration, `gcd_val + y` was greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to that value and `best_y` is updated to the corresponding `y` value, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state of the loop involves `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000, `test_cases` being a list of integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000 and has at least 3 elements, `x` being the third integer in the list, `results` being a list containing the initial value of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` starting at `x - 1`, `gcd_val` being the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` being `gcd_val + y`.
- The loop iterates from `y = x - 1` down to `y = 1`. In each iteration, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, and then computes `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum` at any point, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to `y`. The loop then breaks, meaning it stops executing further.
- If no such `y` is found where `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, the loop will run until `y` reaches 1. In this case, `max_sum` will remain 0 and `best_y` will remain 1.
- After all iterations, `y` will be 1, `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 (which is always 1), and `current_sum` will be `1 + 1` (which is 2).
- The final values of `max_sum` and `best_y` will depend on whether the loop found a `y` that satisfied the condition `gcd_val + y > max_sum`. If it did, `max_sum` and `best_y` will be updated accordingly. If not, `max_sum` will remain 0 and `best_y` will remain 1.
