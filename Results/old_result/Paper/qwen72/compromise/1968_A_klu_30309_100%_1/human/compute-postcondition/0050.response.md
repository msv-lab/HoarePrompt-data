Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is already defined as `x - 3`, `best_y` is now also `x - 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
