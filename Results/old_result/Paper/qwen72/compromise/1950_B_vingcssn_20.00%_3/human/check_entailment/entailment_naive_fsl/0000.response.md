Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and does not generalize for any value of n within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any other value of n, the program will print 'No esta en el rango', which does not meet the problem description requirements.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
5
```
The program will output:
```
No esta en el rango
```
Instead of generating a 10x10 checkerboard pattern as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
