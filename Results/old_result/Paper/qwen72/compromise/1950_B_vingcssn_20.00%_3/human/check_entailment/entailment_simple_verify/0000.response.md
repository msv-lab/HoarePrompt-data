Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and does not generalize for any value of n within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any other value of n, the program will print 'No esta en el rango', which is not the correct output according to the problem description. The problem requires the program to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern for any valid n, and the current implementation fails to do so for n values other than 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
5
```
The program will output:
```
No esta en el rango
```
This is incorrect because the expected output should be a 10x10 checkerboard pattern. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement for all valid inputs, and thus the original assessment of the program being incorrect is justified.

Final: **False**
