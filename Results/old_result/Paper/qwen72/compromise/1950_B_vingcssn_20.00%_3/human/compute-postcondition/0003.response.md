The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function generates a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern and returns this pattern.

Functionality: **The function generates and returns a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 20.**
