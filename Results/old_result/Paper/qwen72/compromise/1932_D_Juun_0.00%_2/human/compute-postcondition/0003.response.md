Output State: **The function should accept three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump_suit` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` (each card is a two-character string where the first character is the rank, one of "23456789", and the second character is the suit, one of "CDHS", and all cards are unique). The input has been read, but the variables `n` and `cards` are not yet assigned specific values. `trump_suit` is now assigned the value of the input, which is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list.**
