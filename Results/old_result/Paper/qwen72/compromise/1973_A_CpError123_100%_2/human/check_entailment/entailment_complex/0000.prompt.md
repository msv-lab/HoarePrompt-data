Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and it should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by a different set of p_1, p_2, and p_3 values.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases, each defined by a different set of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged. The function does not return any value.
