### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Reading Scores:**
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points. This is correct.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all the points of the two lower-scoring players were from draws. This is correct.
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This ensures that the number of draws does not exceed the total number of games played or the sum of the points of the two lower-scoring players. This is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Scores Zero:**
     - If `a = b = c = 0`, the program correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - **One Draw:**
     - If `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because one game ended in a draw.
   - **Invalid Scores:**
     - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because the total sum is odd, making the scores invalid.
   - **Maximum Draws:**
     - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because the total number of games is 2, and both games could have ended in draws.
     - If `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 5`, the program correctly prints `6` because the total number of games is 6, and the maximum number of draws is 6 (all games could have ended in draws).
   - **Large Disparity:**
     - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 10`, the program correctly prints `2` because the total number of games is 6, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (since `a + b = 2`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases as described in the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
