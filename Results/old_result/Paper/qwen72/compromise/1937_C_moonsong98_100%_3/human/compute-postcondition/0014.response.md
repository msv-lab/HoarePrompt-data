Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all elements in the range `[0, n-1]` that are equal to the element at index `n-1` in the array being compared by `func_1`, or `[0]` if all elements are less than the element at index `n-1`, `min_index` is the last element of `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`, or `max_index` if no such element exists, `func_2` has been called with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments.**

The values of `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `min_index` remain unchanged, but `func_2` has been executed with the specified arguments.
