To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so we need to make an assumption based on the context. Given that `res` is compared to the string `'<`', it suggests that `func_1` might be returning a string that indicates a comparison result.

Let's assume `func_1(a, b, c, d)` returns `'<`' if `d` is greater than `b`, and returns something else otherwise. This assumption is based on the typical behavior of comparison functions.

Given this assumption, let's analyze the loop:

1. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
2. For each iteration, `res` is set to the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.
3. If `res` is `'<`', it means `i` is greater than `max_index`, and `max_index` is updated to `i`.

Since `max_index` starts at 0, the first time `i` is greater than `max_index` (which is always true for `i = 1`), `max_index` will be updated to 1. This process continues, and `max_index` will be updated to the highest value of `i` that is less than `n`.

After all iterations, `max_index` will be `n-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`.**
