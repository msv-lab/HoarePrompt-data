The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `min_indices`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `min_indices`. If `min_indices` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all elements in the range `[0, n-1]` that are equal to the element at index `n-1` in the array being compared by `func_1`, or `[0]` if all elements are less than the element at index `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `min_indices` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `min_indices` has at least one element, and `i` is the first element of `min_indices`.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing at least one element, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`, `i` is the first element of `min_indices`**
