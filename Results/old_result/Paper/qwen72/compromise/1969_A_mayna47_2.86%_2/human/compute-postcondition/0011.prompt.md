You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different values of n and p, as specified by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The function either prints 2 and returns immediately, or it completes the loop without printing anything. The values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: If `n` is 2, the function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function is called multiple times with different values of `n` and `p`, as specified by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. `n` is an input integer and has a current value of 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as integers provided by the input. If `n` is not 2, the function either prints 2 and returns immediately, or it completes the loop without printing anything. The values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 2 and 50) and `p` (a list of integers of length `n` where each element `p_i` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`). The function is called `t` times (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) with different values of `n` and `p`. For each test case, it returns "Valid Cycle" if the best friend relationships form a valid cycle, or "Invalid Cycle" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
