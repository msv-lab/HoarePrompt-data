Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Redundant Initialization of `v`**:
   - The array `v` is initialized twice: `v = [0] * (n + 1)` and `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`. The first initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations**:
   - The program checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i` in the range `[1, n + 1]`. This condition is intended to identify a cycle of length 3, but it is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - The program prints `2` if it finds such a cycle and `3` otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider all possible scenarios.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to identify the smallest cycle or the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Here's a more detailed approach:

1. **Identify Cycles**:
   - Use a graph traversal technique (like depth-first search or union-find) to identify cycles in the friendship graph.
   - The smallest cycle will determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - If `n == 2`, the answer is always `2` because both friends must be invited.
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, the answer is `2` because both friends in the cycle will come.
   - If there is a cycle of length 3 or more, the answer is the length of the smallest cycle.

### Example Correct Solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    min_invitations = n

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            current = i
            cycle_length = 0
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = p[current]
                cycle_length += 1
            min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_length)

    if min_invitations == n:
        min_invitations = 3  # If no cycle is found, the minimum is 3

    if n == 2:
        min_invitations = 2

    print(min_invitations)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Use a `visited` array to keep track of which friends have been visited.
   - For each friend, if they haven't been visited, start a traversal to find the cycle length.
   - Update `min_invitations` with the length of the smallest cycle found.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If `n == 2`, the answer is `2`.
   - If no cycle is found, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.
