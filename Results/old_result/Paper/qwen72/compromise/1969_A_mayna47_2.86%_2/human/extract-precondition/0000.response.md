Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different values of n and p, as specified by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases.**
