Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy. The logic within the program is flawed because it only checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, which is not a valid criterion for determining the winner in this game.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to consider the following:

1. If both players have the same number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because they will be the first to run out of coins.
2. If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force a win by ensuring they never end up with fewer coins than the opponent.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly checks if the number of coins in both wallets is the same and prints the appropriate winner based on the optimal play strategy.
