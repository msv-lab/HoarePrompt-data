Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `ans` is 0 if the first element of `s` (denoted as `c`) is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0]; if `c` is 1, `cnt` is updated to [0, 1].***
