The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if the second element of the list `cnt` (which is 0) is greater than 0. Since `cnt[1]` is 0, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, `ans` is not incremented and remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0], `ans` is 0, and `c` is the first element of `s` which is 0.**
