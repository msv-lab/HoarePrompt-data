Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `c` is the second element of `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0 or [0, 2] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 1 if `c` is 1, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], so `cnt[1]` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged (still 0).
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 2], so `cnt[1]` is 2. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1, making `ans` equal to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `c`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
