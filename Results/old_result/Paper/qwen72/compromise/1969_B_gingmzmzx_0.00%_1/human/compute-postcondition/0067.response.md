The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value of `cnt` at the index specified by `c` by 1. 

- Initially, `cnt` is `[0, 2]`.
- `c` is the second element in `s`, which means `c` is either 0 or 1.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented from 2 to 3.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `c` is the second element in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 2] if `c` is 0, or `cnt` is [0, 3] if `c` is 1, `ans` is `zeroes` + 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.**
