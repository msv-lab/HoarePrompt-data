The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each character in the stripped string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1
- `n` is 1
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the original `s`
- `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`]
- `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in `s`

After executing the code snippet, the list `s` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 (updated from input), `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the new `s`, number of 1s in the new `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in the new `s` multiplied by the number of 1s in the new `s`.**
