Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the new `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`zeroes`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the total number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the total number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` is incremented based on the conditions inside the loop. For each 0 encountered, `ans` is incremented by 1 if there are any 1s before it. For each 1 encountered, `ans` is incremented by the number of 0s remaining in the list. Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of the number of 1s before each 0 in `s` plus the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in `s`.
