Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, and if `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `c` remains the first element of `s`.
