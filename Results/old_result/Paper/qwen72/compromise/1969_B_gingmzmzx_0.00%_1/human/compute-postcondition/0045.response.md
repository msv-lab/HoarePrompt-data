The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` and `ans` is 0. So, `ans` becomes `0 + (zeroes - 3)`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[0, 3]` and `ans` is `2 * zeroes`. So, `ans` becomes `2 * zeroes + (zeroes - 0)` which simplifies to `3 * zeroes`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 3 elements
- `n` is greater than 0
- `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`
- `c` is the third element of `s`
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` and `ans` is `zeroes - 3`
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[0, 3]` and `ans` is `3 * zeroes`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`, if `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0] and `ans` is `zeroes - 3`, if `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 3] and `ans` is `3 * zeroes`.**
