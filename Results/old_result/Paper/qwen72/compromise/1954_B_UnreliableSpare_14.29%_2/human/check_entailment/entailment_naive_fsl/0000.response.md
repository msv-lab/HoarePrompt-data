Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being a "beautiful" array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```

The program will output `1`, but this is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because you need to remove two elements to make the array stop being beautiful. The array after removing two elements could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`, neither of which can be made beautiful with the given operations.

The issue lies in the logic where the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove. It assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not always lead to the correct result for arrays that are not entirely composed of the same elements.
