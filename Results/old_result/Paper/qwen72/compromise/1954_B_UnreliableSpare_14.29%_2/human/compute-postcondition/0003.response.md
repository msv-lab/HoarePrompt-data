To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1, which is the first value in the range `range(1, n)`.
2. **Variable `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the range `range(1, n)` will be empty, and the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is assigned the value of an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `flag` is True.

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `i` is already correctly set to start from 1, as specified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
