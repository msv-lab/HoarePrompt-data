You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the positions of the first and last occurrences of the character 'B' in the string `s`. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B', plus 2. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the comments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.

2. **Finding the First and Last Black Cells:**
   - The program uses two loops to find the positions of the first and last black cells in the string `s`.
   - The first loop iterates from the start of the string and increments a counter `c` until it finds the first black cell. The position of the first black cell is stored in `mi`.
   - The second loop iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter `d` until it finds the last black cell. The position of the last black cell is stored in `ma`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2`.
   - This formula is intended to cover the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Issues and Analysis:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Segment Length:**
  - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to include both the first and last black cells in the segment length.
  - For example, if the first black cell is at position 2 and the last black cell is at position 5, the segment length should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, not `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should handle the case where there is only one black cell correctly. In such cases, the minimum segment length should be 1.
  - The program should also handle the case where the strip is entirely black or entirely white correctly. However, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this is not a concern.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    mi = len(s) + 1  # Initialize to a value greater than any possible index
    ma = 0  # Initialize to a value less than any possible index
    for j in range(len(s)):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            mi = min(mi, j + 1)  # Find the first black cell
            ma = max(ma, j + 1)  # Find the last black cell
    return ma - mi + 1  # Correct formula for the segment length
```

### Correctness:

- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the segment length.
- The corrected program uses the correct formula `ma - mi + 1` to calculate the minimum segment length.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
