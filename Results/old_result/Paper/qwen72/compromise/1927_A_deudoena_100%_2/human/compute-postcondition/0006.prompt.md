Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer between 1 and 10 and a string of that length consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
