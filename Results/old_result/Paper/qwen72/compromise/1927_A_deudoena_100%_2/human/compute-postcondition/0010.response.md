The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` consists of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in each string.

The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` and the position of the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2, for each test case.**
