The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a context where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. The function is expected to handle these inputs according to the constraints: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Given the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one, possibly in a list or other collection format.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. It returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases being `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.**
