The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is updated to the input string, which is part of the tuple in `cases`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `i` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` is a list of tuples (n, k, m, s) where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `s`. `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is an empty list. `ps` is 0.**
