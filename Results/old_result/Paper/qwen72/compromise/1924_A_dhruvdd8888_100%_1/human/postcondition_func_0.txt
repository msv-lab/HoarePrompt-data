The function `func_1` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m`. It processes the string `s` to find contiguous subsequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such subsequences found is greater than or equal to `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns 'YES'. If fewer than `n` such subsequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and returns a string that is the concatenation of the characters found in the subsequences, the first character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last subsequence, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
