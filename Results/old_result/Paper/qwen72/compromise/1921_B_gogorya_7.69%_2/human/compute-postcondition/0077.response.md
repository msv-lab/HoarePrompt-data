The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` has just been incremented by 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `hd` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged**
