Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is equal to `n`, `hd` is the initial value of `a1 - a2` minus the number of times `hd` was greater than 0 during the loop, and `res` is the absolute value of the initial `a1 - a2` plus the number of times `s1[i]` was '1' and `s2[i]` was '0' for each `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `hd` was not greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' after the initial `hd` positions are skipped. `hd` is 0 or a negative value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `hd` is the greater of 0 or `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' in the range from 0 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
