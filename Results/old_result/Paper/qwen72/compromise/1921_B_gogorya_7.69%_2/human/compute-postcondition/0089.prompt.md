Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is a new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decremented by 1 and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `hd` remains unchanged if `hd` is 0 or is decreased by 1 if `hd` is greater than 0. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `hd` remains 0 if it was initially 0 or is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
