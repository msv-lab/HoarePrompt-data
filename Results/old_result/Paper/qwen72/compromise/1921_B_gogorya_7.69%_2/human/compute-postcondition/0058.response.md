Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was not greater than 0, or `hd` remains `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was greater than 0. Otherwise, `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.***
