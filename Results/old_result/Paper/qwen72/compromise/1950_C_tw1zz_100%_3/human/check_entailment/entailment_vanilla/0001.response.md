Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour part of the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets the hour to the same value and the time to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly sets the hour to the corresponding hour in the 12-hour format and the time to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets the hour to `12` and the time to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program constructs the output string in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using the `print` function with the `sep` parameter to ensure there are no extra spaces between the components of the time.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `00:00` (which should be `12:00 AM`) and `12:00` (which should be `12:00 PM`) correctly.
   - It also handles leading zeros in the hour and minute parts correctly, as required by the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly convert the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
