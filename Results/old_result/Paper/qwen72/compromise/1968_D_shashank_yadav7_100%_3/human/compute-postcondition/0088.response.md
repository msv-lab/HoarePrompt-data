Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
- The precondition that `k` is -3 or decreased by 3 is still valid.
- The precondition that `b` is `p[b] - 1` is still valid.
- The precondition that `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp` is still valid.
- The precondition that `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp` is still valid.
- The precondition that `sp` is increased by `a[s]` is still valid.
- The precondition that `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice is still valid.
- The precondition that if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid.
