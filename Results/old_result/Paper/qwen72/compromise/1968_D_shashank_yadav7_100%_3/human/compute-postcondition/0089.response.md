Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are not directly changed by this code snippet, but their states are still valid.
- The specific values of `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `bm`, `bp`, `sm`, and `sp` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact new value of `bm`. However, we know that `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `a[b] * k + bp`.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`) remain as they were in the initial state, with their respective conditions and updates.
