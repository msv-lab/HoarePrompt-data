The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `k`, so we can only state that `k` is decreased by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1**
