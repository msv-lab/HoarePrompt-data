Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -3 or decreased by 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice, `sp` is further increased by `a[s]`.**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is increased by `a[s]` again, so `sp` is now increased by `2 * a[s]` compared to its initial value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
