The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
