Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1 or decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is increased by the value of `a[s]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged or are still updated based on their previous conditions.
- The specific values of `bm` and `sm` depend on the values of `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `k`, `bp`, and `sp`, which are not provided, but the update logic for `bm` and `sm` remains the same.
