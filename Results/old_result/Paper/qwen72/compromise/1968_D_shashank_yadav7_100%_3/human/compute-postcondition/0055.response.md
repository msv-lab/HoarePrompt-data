Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
- The initial state already mentions that `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, so this code snippet does not change the value of `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables (`sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, and the loop breaking condition) remain as specified in the initial state.
