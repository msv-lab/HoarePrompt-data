Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated by adding `a[b]` to its current value.
- The new value of `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b]`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
