Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1` (or `n` if the loop breaks early), `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n` (or `k - i` if the loop breaks early), `b` is the result of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `s` is the result of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks. Additionally, `bm` is less than `sm`.**
