Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1` (or `n` if the loop breaks early), `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n` (or `k - i` if the loop breaks early), `b` is the result of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `s` is the result of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`), `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all `n` iterations, or `n` if the loop breaks early due to `k` reaching 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- The variable `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations (or `i` iterations if the loop breaks early), `k` will be `k - n` (or `k - i`).
- The variable `b` is updated by repeatedly applying the function `p[b] - 1` for `n` or `i` iterations, depending on whether the loop breaks early.
- The variable `s` is updated by repeatedly applying the function `p[s] - 1` for `n` or `i` iterations, depending on whether the loop breaks early.
- The variable `p` remains unchanged as it is only used to update `b` and `s`.
- The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is only used to update `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`.
- The variable `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations.
- The variable `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations.
- The variable `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations.
- The variable `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations.
- If `k` reaches 0 at any point during the loop, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks.
