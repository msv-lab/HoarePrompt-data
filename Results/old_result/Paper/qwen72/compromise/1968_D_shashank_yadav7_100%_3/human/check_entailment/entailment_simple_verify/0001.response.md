### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function iterates `n` times to simulate the game turns, which is incorrect. It should iterate `k` times.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p` using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`. This is incorrect because `p` is already 0-based indexed, so the correct update should be `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]`.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the corresponding values from `a`.
   - It also updates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the current score and the remaining turns. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game rules. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a combination of the current score and the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the simulation, the function compares the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it's a draw.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Termination**:
   - The loop should run exactly `k` times, not `n` times. The loop should be `for _ in range(k)` instead of `for i in range(n)`.

2. **Incorrect Position Update**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because `p` is already 0-based indexed. The correct update should be `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]`.

3. **Incorrect Update of Maximum Scores**:
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated incorrectly. The logic `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` does not accurately reflect the game rules. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a combination of the current score and the remaining turns.

4. **Redundant Variables**:
   - The variables `sp` and `bp` are used to track the current scores, but they are not necessary if the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` are updated correctly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The loop runs exactly `k` times to simulate the game.
- The positions are updated correctly using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` (which should be `p[b]` and `p[s]` if `p` is 0-based indexed).
- The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the corresponding values from `a` for each turn.
- After the loop, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program has logical errors in the way it updates the scores and positions, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.

Final: **False**
