You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements and the values in the permutation `p` and array `a`. The function then prints the result of the game for each test case: 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum score is greater, 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum score is greater, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the corresponding values from `a`.
   - It also updates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the current score and the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the simulation, the function compares the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it's a draw.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Update of Maximum Scores**:
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated incorrectly. The logic `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` does not accurately reflect the game rules. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a combination of the current score and the remaining turns.

2. **Incorrect Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, but it should run exactly `k` times. The loop should be `for _ in range(k)` instead of `for i in range(n)`.

3. **Incorrect Position Update**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because `p` is already 0-based indexed. The correct update should be `b = p[b]` and `s = p[s]`.

4. **Redundant Variables**:
   - The variables `sp` and `bp` are used to track the current scores, but they are not necessary if the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` are updated correctly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The loop runs exactly `k` times to simulate the game.
- The positions are updated correctly using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` (which should be `p[b]` and `p[s]` if `p` is 0-based indexed).
- The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the corresponding values from `a` for each turn.
- After the loop, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has logical errors in the way it updates the scores and positions, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.
