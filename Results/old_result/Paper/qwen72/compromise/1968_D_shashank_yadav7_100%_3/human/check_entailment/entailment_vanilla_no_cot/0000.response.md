Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few logical issues that make it incorrect for the problem described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by moving them through the permutation and updating their scores. However, the logic for updating the scores is flawed.
   - Specifically, the lines `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. These lines are trying to calculate the maximum possible score by considering the current score and the remaining number of turns, but they do not correctly account for the actual movement through the permutation and the scores accumulated at each step.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` is iterating over the length of the permutation, but it should be iterating over the number of turns `k`. The program incorrectly decrements `k` inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect results if `k` is greater than `n`.

3. **Incorrect Movement Through Permutation:**
   - The program uses `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` to move through the permutation, but this is incorrect because the permutation is 1-indexed, and the indices should not be decremented by 1. Instead, the correct movement should be `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` without the `- 1`.

4. **Incorrect Final Score Comparison:**
   - The final comparison of scores `if bm > sm:` and `if bm < sm:` is based on the incorrect calculation of `bm` and `sm`, which leads to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
1. Simulate the game for exactly `k` turns for both Bodya and Sasha.
2. Track their positions and scores accurately.
3. Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust positions to 0-indexed
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        score_b = a[b]
        score_s = a[s]
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            score_b += a[b]
            score_s += a[s]
        
        # Determine the winner
        if score_b > score_s:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_b < score_s:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:**
  - `b` and `s` are adjusted to 0-indexed positions.
  - `score_b` and `score_s` are initialized with the scores from their starting positions.
- **Simulation:**
  - The game is simulated for `k` turns. For each turn, the players' positions are updated according to the permutation, and their scores are incremented by the value at the new position.
- **Comparison:**
  - After `k` turns, the final scores are compared to determine the winner.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
