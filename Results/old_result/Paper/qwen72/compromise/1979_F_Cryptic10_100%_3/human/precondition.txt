t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Each query is in the format "? d" where d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1. The graph is a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed.
