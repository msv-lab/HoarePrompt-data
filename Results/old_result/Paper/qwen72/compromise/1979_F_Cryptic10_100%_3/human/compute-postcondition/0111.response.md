The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list must be available. 

At the end of the last iteration, `v1` and `v2` were the values from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list. For the next iteration, `v1` and `v2` will be the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. The `ops` list must contain at least three tuples for the loop to execute again.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1` and the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. `p2` is an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least three tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.**
