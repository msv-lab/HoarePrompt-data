Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain all the tuples it initially had. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop. `v1` and `v2` are the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` before the loop condition fails.**

In natural language, this means:
- `p1` will have all the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`.
- `p2` will contain any `v1` values appended from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`.
- `ops` will still contain all the tuples it started with, as the loop does not modify `ops`.
- `vx` will be a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop.
- `v1` and `v2` will be the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails.
- If `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails, `v3` will be the last value returned by `q(0)`.
