Output State: **If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains `v1` and the last element of `p1` is still equal to `v2`. `p2` remains an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least three tuples. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.**
