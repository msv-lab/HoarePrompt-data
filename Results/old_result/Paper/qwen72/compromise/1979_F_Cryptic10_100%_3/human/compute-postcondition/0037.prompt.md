Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers removed from `vx` during the loop execution, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in `ops`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and `v1` is appended to it, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and `v1` is appended to it, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in `ops`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
