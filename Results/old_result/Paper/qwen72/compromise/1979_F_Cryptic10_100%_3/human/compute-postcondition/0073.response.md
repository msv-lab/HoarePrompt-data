The objects in the loop head are `v1`, `v2`, and `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- `ops` must contain at least two tuples.
- `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list (which is the third tuple from the end of the original `ops` list) must be considered. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` will be the elements of this third tuple. The `ops` list must still contain at least two tuples to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
