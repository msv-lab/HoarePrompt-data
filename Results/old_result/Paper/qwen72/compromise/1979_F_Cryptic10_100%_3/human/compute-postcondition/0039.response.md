The only objects in the loop head are the throwaway variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `int(input())` must be greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, and `_` is a throwaway variable that gets incremented by 1 with each iteration.

Given that the loop has already executed at least once, the current iteration count is 1 (since `_` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 each time). For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 1 (since the loop has already executed once, and the loop condition checks if `_` is less than `int(input())`).

However, since `int(input())` is a function call that could potentially change with each iteration, we cannot assume that the value of `int(input())` remains the same. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least as many tuples as the number of iterations, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`**
