Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus the integer `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, and the second value returned by `q(0)` is ignored.**
