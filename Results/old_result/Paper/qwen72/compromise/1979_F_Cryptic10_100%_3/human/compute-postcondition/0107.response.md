The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ops`. If `ops` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The state of `p1`, `p2`, `vx`, `v3`, and the values of `v1` and `v2` outside of the loop head do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v1` and `v2` should be the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails**
