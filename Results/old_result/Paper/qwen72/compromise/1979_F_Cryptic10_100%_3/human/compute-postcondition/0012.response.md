Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` except `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`, `_` is assigned the second value returned by `q(0)`.***
