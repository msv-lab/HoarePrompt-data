Output State: **`v3` is removed from `vx`, `_` is 1, `v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1` (and minus `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` <= 0, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, `vx` no longer contains `v1` or `v3` if `v2` <= 0.**

Explanation:
- `v3` is removed from the set `vx`.
- The initial state specifies that `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` minus `v1` (and minus `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0). After removing `v3`, this condition is still met.
- The values of `_`, `v1`, `v2`, `int(input())`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` no longer contains `v1` or `v3`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `vx` no longer contains `v3`.
