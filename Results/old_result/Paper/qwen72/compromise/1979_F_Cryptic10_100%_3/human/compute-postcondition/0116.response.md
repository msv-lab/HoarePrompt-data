Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment and does not accept any explicit parameters. It must handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a complete undirected graph from which (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make at most n queries to the interactor to determine the structure of the graph. For each test case, the function returns a Hamiltonian path. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
