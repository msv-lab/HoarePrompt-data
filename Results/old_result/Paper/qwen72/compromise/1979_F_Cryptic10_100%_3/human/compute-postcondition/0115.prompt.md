Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A lambda function `q` is defined which, when called with an argument `d`, prints the query "? d" to the console and then reads and maps the input response to integers. The initial state of the function operating in an interactive environment with the specified constraints remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least as many tuples as the number of iterations, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` has 2 elements left.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2`. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain all the tuples it initially had. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements, which are the remaining elements after all iterations of the loop. `v1` and `v2` are the last values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the loop condition fails. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` before the loop condition fails.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
