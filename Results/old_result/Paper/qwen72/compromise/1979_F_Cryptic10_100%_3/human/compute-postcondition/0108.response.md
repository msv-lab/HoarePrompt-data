Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`. `p2` is an empty list if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`. `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple. `v1` and `v2` are the values from the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list. `vx` is a set containing at most 2 elements. `v3` is the last value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0 before the loop condition fails.**
