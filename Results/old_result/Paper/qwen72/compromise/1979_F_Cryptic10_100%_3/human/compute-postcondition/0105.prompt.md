Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive). `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation. `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) minus the integer `v1` if `v2` is greater than 0, or minus the integers `v1` and `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is assigned the value returned by `q(0)`, and the second value returned by `q(0)` is ignored.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` > 0, `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `vx` has one element removed, which was `v1`. If `v2` is 0 or less, `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `vx` has one element removed, which was `v1`. If `v2` is 0 or less, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `vx` has two elements removed, the first being `v3` and the second being `v1`, and `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)`. `vx` must have at least 2 elements to ensure `len(vx) > 2` for the next iteration.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
