Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through a series of queries and responses. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. The graph is initially a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make at most n queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) to the interactor, and must output a Hamiltonian path for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
