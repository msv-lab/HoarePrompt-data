### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `k` is even.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts with `answer = [1]` and a list `a = [1, -1]` to keep track of the indices for alternating selections.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends the element at index `a[-1]` (which is `n - 1` initially) to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends the element at index `a[0]` (which is 0 initially) to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `answer` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function aims to construct a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The alternating selection of elements from the start and end of the `array` ensures that the elements are distributed in a way that minimizes the difference in sums of continuous segments.
   - However, the initial `answer = [1]` and the alternating pattern might not always ensure that the sums of segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `[2, 1]`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output is `[1, 3, 2]`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the output is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
     - Sums of segments of length 4:
       - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
       - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
       - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
       - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
       - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
       - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
       - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
     - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, which is correct.
   - For `n = 13` and `k = 4`, the output is `[4, 10, 1, 13, 5, 9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 3, 11, 7]`.
     - Sums of segments of length 4:
       - `4 + 10 + 1 + 13 = 28`
       - `10 + 1 + 13 + 5 = 29`
       - `1 + 13 + 5 + 9 = 28`
       - `13 + 5 + 9 + 2 = 29`
       - `5 + 9 + 2 + 12 = 28`
       - `9 + 2 + 12 + 6 = 29`
       - `2 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 28`
       - `12 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 29`
       - `6 + 8 + 3 + 11 = 28`
       - `8 + 3 + 11 + 7 = 29`
     - The maximum sum is 29 and the minimum sum is 28, so the difference is 1, which is correct.
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the output is `[1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4]`.
     - Sums of segments of length 4:
       - `1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17`
       - `6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18`
       - `3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17`
       - `7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18`
     - The maximum sum is 18 and the minimum sum is 17, so the difference is 1, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given test cases. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, which meets the problem's requirements.
