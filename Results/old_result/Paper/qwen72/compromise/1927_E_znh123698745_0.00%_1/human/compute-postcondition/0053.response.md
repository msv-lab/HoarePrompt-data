Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- **`_`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input positive integer greater than 1, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains the input positive integer, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`array`**: Remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, so `i` will have the value `n-1` at the end.
- **`answer`**: The list `answer` will contain the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern. Specifically, it will start with 1, then alternate between the last element of `array` and the first element of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included.
- **`a`**: The list `a` will contain the integers `n` and `-n`. This is because the loop modifies `a[0]` and `a[-1]` in such a way that they increment and decrement, respectively, until they reach the end of the `array` list. After `n-1` iterations, `a[0]` will be `n` and `a[-1]` will be `-n`.
