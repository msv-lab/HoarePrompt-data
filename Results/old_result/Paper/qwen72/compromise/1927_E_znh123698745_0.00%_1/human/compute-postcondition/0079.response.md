Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 3, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, a `NameError` is raised. Otherwise, `answer` is a list that contains the first element of `array`, which is 2.***
