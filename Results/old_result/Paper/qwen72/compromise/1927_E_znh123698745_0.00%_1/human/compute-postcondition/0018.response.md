Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` is a list that now includes the value of `array[a[-1]]`, and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `answer` is a list that now includes the first element of `array`, and `array[0]` is 2.***
