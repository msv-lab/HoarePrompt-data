The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a` by subtracting 1 from it. Let's break down the impact on the program:

- `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -2 or the integers 2 and -1, depending on whether `(-1)` is in `a`.
- If `a` contains 1 and -2, then `a[-1]` is -2, and after the operation, `a[-1]` becomes -3.
- If `a` contains 2 and -1, then `a[-1]` is -1, and after the operation, `a[-1]` becomes -2.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `i`, and `answer`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and `array[a[-1]]`, and `a` is a list containing either the integers 1 and -3 or the integers 2 and -2, depending on whether `(-1)` was in `a`.**
