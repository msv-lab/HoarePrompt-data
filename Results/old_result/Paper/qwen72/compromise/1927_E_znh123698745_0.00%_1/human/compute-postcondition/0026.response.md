Let's break down the initial state and the code to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
- `_` is 0. This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `k` is a positive integer. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n = 5`, then `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `i` is `n-1`. For example, if `n = 5`, then `i = 4`.
- `answer` is a list that alternates between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included. For example, if `n = 5`, then `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `answer` will be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.
- `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`. For example, if `n = 5`, then `a = [5, -5]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the list `answer` separated by spaces.
- The list `answer` is constructed by alternating between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example where `n = 5`:
- `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `i = 4`
- `answer` will be constructed as follows:
  - First element: `1`
  - Last element: `5`
  - Second element: `2`
  - Second last element: `4`
  - Middle element: `3`
- Therefore, `answer = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`

### General Case:
For any positive integer `n` greater than 1:
- The list `array` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, n]`.
- The list `answer` will be constructed by alternating between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements are included.

### Final Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of `answer` in the order they are constructed, separated by spaces.

Output: **1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n//2 + 1) (where n is the value of n and the list alternates between the first and last elements of the array until all elements from 1 to n are included)**

This output format describes the sequence of elements printed, where `n` is the value of `n` and the list alternates between the first and last elements of the array until all elements from 1 to `n` are included.
