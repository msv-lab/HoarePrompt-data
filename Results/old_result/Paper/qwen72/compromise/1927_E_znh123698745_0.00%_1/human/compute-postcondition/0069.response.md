The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the list `answer` and the list `a` were not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume they are already defined and `a` contains at least one element. The value of `a[-1]` (the last element of `a`) is used as an index to access an element in `array`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1
- `k` is an input positive integer
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `i` is 2

The impact of the code:
- `answer` is updated by appending the value of `array[a[-1]]` to it.

Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `a[-1]` is an index, the value appended to `answer` will be the integer at the position `a[-1]` in `array`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` has been updated by appending the integer at the position `a[-1]` in `array`.**
