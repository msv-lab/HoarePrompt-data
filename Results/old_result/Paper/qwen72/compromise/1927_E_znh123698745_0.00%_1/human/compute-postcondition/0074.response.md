The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 3, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3.**
