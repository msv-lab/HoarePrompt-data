Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values provided by `input()`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and `t` is 1. `edges` is an empty list. The list of starting nodes for each round is not affected.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the list `edges` to an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain as they were provided by the `input()`, and the list of starting nodes for each round is not modified.
