    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop. Specifically, `dp` will have non-zero values at indices that are reachable by moving `i` steps left or right from the initial index `n`, and the values will be the result of cumulative additions modulo `MOD`. The exact values in `dp` depend on the cumulative effect of the updates from `new_dp` over all iterations. `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n`, and `new_dp` is no longer referenced.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of list `p` plus `n`. `dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, and `final_sum` is an index within this list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It computes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `2*n + 1` and updates it based on transitions defined in a loop. The function returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `p` remains a list of `n` integers, and the `dp` array contains the results of the dynamic programming transitions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, representing the size of the hidden array a. p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.

The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are then passed to another function `func_1`. The results of `func_1` for each test case are collected and printed one by one. After the function completes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `p` retain their last read values, and the list `results` contains the return values from `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value directly but outputs the results to the standard output.
