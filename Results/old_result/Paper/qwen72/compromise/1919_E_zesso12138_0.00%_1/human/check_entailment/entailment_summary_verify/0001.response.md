### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` consisting of 1s and -1s that, when their prefix sums are sorted, match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we need to ensure that the prefix sums of `a` can be rearranged to match `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid arrays `a`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` with a size of `2 * n + 1` to handle the range of possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The offset `n` is used to shift the range of prefix sums to avoid negative indices.
   - The DP array is updated for each element in the array by considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.
   - The final result is obtained from the DP array at the position corresponding to the last element of the prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the prefix sum array `p`, calls `func_1` to compute the result, and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

4. **Validation:**
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the specified limit of 998,244,353.
   - The input handling in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that all possible combinations of 1s and -1s are considered, and the input handling in `func_2` correctly processes the test cases.

Final: **True**
