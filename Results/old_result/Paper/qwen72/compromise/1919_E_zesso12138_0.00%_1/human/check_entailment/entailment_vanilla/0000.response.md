### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of a hidden array `a` consisting of only 1s and -1s.
   - The task is to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `i - n` (where `n` is the length of the array).
   - The offset is used to handle negative indices by shifting the range from `-n` to `n` to `0` to `2n`.
   - For each element in the array, it updates the DP array by considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, it returns the value at the position corresponding to the last element of the prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the prefix sum array `p`, calls `func_1` to compute the result, and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

4. **Validation:**
   - The approach correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The dynamic programming solution ensures that all possible combinations of 1s and -1s are considered.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the specified limit.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
