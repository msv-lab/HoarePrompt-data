Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, and `j` is `2 * n`. After all iterations, `new_dp` has been updated based on the values in `dp` such that for each `j` where `dp[j] > 0`, `new_dp[j-1]` and `new_dp[j+1]` (if within bounds) have been incremented by `dp[j] % MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all indices `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.
- For each index `j`, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, the values at `new_dp[j-1]` and `new_dp[j+1]` (if they are within the valid range) are updated by adding `dp[j] % MOD`.
- After the loop completes, `dp` will be updated to the values in `new_dp`, and `new_dp` will be reset to a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0.
- The final state of `dp` reflects the cumulative updates made during the loop, while `new_dp` is reset to its initial state.
