The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The initial value of `index` is 2, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `2 + n`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is an empty list.**
