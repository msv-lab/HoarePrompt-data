Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.***
