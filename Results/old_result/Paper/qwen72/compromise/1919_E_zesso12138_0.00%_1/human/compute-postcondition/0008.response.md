Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n, and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `input`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and properties.
