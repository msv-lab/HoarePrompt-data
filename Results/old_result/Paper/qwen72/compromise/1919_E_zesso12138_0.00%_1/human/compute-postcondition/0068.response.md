Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `j` is 1. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[0]` is set to `(dp[1] % MOD)`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[2]` is set to `(dp[1] % MOD)`.***
