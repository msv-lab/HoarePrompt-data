The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Let's break down the changes:

- `p` was initially a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`.
- The new `p` is now a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`.
- `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
- `index` is `3 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is updated to be a list of integers converted from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2*n]`, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is `3 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.**
