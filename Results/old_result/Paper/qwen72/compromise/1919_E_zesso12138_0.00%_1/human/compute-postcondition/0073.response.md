The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it, and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `p` is still a list of `n` integers
- `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`
- `offset` is `n`
- `i` is 3
- `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0
- `j` is 2
- If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `(dp[2] % MOD)`

The code snippet:
```python
new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. `j - 1` evaluates to `1` because `j` is 2.
2. `new_dp[1]` is initially 0.
3. `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`.
4. The new value of `new_dp[1]` is `(0 + dp[2]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[2] % MOD`.

Therefore, the updated value of `new_dp[1]` is `dp[2] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers initialized to 0 except `new_dp[1]` which is `dp[2] % MOD`, `j` is 2. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[3]` is set to `(dp[2] % MOD)`.**
