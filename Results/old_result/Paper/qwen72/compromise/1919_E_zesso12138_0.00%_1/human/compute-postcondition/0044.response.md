Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer, `p` is still a list of `n` integers, `dp` is now a list of `2*n + 1` integers where each element has been updated based on the transitions defined in the loop, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of `2*n + 1` integers, `j` is 3, and `2 * n + 1` must be greater than 3. If `dp[3]` is greater than 0, and if `j - 1` (which is 2) is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD`. Additionally, if `j + 1` (which is 4) is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[4]` is updated to `(new_dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD`. If `dp[3]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
