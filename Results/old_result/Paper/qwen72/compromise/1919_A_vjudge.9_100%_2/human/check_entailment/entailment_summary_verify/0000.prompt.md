You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. It then reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b` (where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`) from the input. For each pair, the function checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the function prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference is odd, the function prints 'Alice'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified and are not accessible outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. The logic in the program is based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`). However, this does not accurately reflect the game's rules, where players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove a coin. 

A specific case where the program fails is when `a = 2` and `b = 1`. According to the program, it would output "Bob" because the difference `1` is odd. However, the correct outcome should be "Alice" because Alice can play optimally by swapping wallets in her first turn, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins. Then, Bob will be forced to remove a coin, leaving him with 1 coin. Alice can then remove her coin, forcing Bob to remove his last coin, and Bob will be unable to make a move, thus losing the game. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases.
