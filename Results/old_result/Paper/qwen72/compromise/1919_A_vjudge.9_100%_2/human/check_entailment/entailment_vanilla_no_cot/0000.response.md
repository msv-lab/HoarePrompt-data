Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not accurately determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The solution checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, but this is not the correct criterion for determining the winner.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially a turn-based game where the player with the higher number of coins can always force the game into a state where the opponent is at a disadvantage. The key observation is that if the number of coins in both wallets is the same, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty, and it will be Alice's turn to make a move, which she cannot do.

However, if the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the opponent has fewer coins and will eventually be unable to make a move. Therefore, the correct logic should be:

- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a > b`, Alice wins.
- If `a < b`, Bob wins.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a > b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.
