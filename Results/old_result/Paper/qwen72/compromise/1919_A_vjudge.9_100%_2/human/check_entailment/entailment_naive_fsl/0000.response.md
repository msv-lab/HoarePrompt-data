Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. The logic in the program is based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`). However, this does not accurately reflect the game's rules, where players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove a coin. 

A specific case where the program fails is when `a = 2` and `b = 1`. According to the program, it would output "Bob" because the difference `1` is odd. However, the correct outcome should be "Alice" because Alice can play optimally by swapping wallets in her first turn, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins. Then, Bob will be forced to remove a coin, leaving him with 1 coin. Alice can then remove her coin, forcing Bob to remove his last coin, and Bob will be unable to make a move, thus losing the game. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases.
