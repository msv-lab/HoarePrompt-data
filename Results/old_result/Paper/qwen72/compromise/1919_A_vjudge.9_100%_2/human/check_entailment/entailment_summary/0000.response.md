Reasoning:  
The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (even or odd) of the number of coins in the wallets. 

1. **Initial Observation**: If both players have the same number of coins, the game will end in a draw if they keep swapping, but since the game rules state that the player who cannot make a move loses, the game will actually end when one player is forced to remove the last coin from their wallet, making it impossible for the other player to make a move. This means that if both players start with the same number of coins, the player who makes the first move (Alice) will always lose because she will be the one to make the last move that leaves her wallet empty.

2. **Parity Analysis**: The game can be analyzed based on the parity of the number of coins. If the number of coins in both wallets is either both even or both odd, the absolute difference between the number of coins will be even. If one wallet has an even number of coins and the other has an odd number of coins, the absolute difference will be odd.

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice removes a coin, Bob removes a coin. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one to make the last move that leaves her wallet empty.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he will lose. Alice can start by either swapping or removing a coin, and then mirror Bob's subsequent moves. This ensures that Alice will always be able to make a move after Bob, and Bob will eventually be the one to make the last move that leaves his wallet empty.

The program provided checks the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and prints 'Bob' if the difference is even, and 'Alice' if the difference is odd. This logic is consistent with the winning strategy described above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
