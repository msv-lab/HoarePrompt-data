### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin, and vice versa), and the game will end when both wallets are empty, with Bob making the last move.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always make the first move to create an even difference, and then Bob will be forced to mirror Alice's moves, leading to Alice making the last move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in each wallet for each test case.
   - The program correctly computes the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and checks its parity.
   - The program prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.
   - The state of the program after each iteration of the loop is consistent with the problem description and the logic described in the key insight.

5. **Verification of Test Cases**:
   - Let's verify the given test cases:
     - **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
       - `abs(1 - 1) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".
     - **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
       - `abs(1 - 4) % 2 == 1` (odd), so the program prints "Alice".
     - **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
       - `abs(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".
     - **Test Case 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
       - `abs(4 - 5) % 2 == 1` (odd), so the program prints "Alice".
     - **Test Case 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
       - `abs(11 - 9) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".
     - **Test Case 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
       - `abs(83 - 91) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".
     - **Test Case 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
       - `abs(1032 - 9307) % 2 == 1` (odd), so the program prints "Alice".
     - **Test Case 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
       - `abs(839204 - 7281) % 2 == 1` (odd), so the program prints "Alice".
     - **Test Case 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
       - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".
     - **Test Case 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
       - `abs(53110 - 2024) % 2 == 0` (even), so the program prints "Bob".

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is correct and matches the key insight.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for each test case.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program's state and behavior are as expected.
