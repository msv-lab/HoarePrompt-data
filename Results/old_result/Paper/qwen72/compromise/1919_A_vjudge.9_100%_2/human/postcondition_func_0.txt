The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. It then reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b` (where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`) from the input. For each pair, the function checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the function prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference is odd, the function prints 'Alice'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified and are not accessible outside the function.
