Postcondition: **`a` remains a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[14]`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and `ind` contains those indices; `k` is 14.**
