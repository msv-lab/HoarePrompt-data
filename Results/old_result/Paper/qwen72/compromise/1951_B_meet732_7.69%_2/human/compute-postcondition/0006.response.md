Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - Each integer \(a_i\) is unique and within the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `x` is equal to `a[14]`.
   - `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - `c` is 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and `ind` contains those indices.
   - `k` is 14.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ind)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `x` is set to the value of `a[14]`.
   - `ind` is a list that will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `ind` will contain the indices of all such elements.
   - The number of elements in `ind` is stored in `c`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `x` is `a[14]`, we need to find the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]`.
   - If there are at least two such elements, `ind` will contain their indices.
   - If there are fewer than two such elements, `ind` will contain the indices of all elements greater than `a[14]`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print(ind)` statement will output the list of indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]`, or the indices of all such elements if there are fewer than two.

Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]`, or the indices of all such elements if there are fewer than two)**
