Postcondition: **`a` remains a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[14]`; `ind` is an empty list, indicating that there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 0, as there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.**
