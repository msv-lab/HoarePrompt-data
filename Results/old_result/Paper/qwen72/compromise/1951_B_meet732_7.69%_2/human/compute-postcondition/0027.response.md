The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each integer `a_i` is unique and within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

Functionality: **The function returns different values based on the conditions:**
- **Case 1:** If the number of integers in the list `a` is between 2 and 100,000, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case 2:** If `k` is not defined, the return value cannot be determined.
- **Case 3:** If the first element in the list `ind` is greater than `k` and not 0, the function returns the value of the first element in `ind` minus 1.
- **Case 4:** If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `ind[0]`, the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case 5:** If the first element of `ind` is 0 and the second element of `ind` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, the function returns the smaller value between this index minus 1 and `k - 1`.
- **Case 6:** If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- **Case 7:** If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
