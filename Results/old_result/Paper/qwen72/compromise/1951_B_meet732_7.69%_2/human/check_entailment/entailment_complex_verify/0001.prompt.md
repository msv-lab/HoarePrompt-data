You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and an integer `k` (not explicitly passed as a parameter but assumed to be available in the function scope). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
1. If no elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
2. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is not 0, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
3. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
4. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
5. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
6. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and the first index is 0, it returns the minimum of the second index minus 1 and `k - 1`.
7. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is greater than the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and the difference between the second and first indices.
8. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is less than or equal to the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and `k - ind[0]`.

Additionally, if `k` is 14, the function prints the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]` (or all such elements if fewer than two).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a list of `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match is the cow with the higher rating.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (index `k`) with any other cow exactly once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `l` and calls the function `func_1` with this list.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It identifies the rating of our cow `x` and initializes a list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and appends the index of cows with ratings higher than `x` to `ind` until it finds two such cows.
   - If no cows have a higher rating than `x`, the function returns `n - 1` (our cow can win all matches).
   - If only one cow has a higher rating than `x`, the function returns the maximum number of matches our cow can win based on the position of this cow.
   - If two cows have higher ratings than `x`, the function returns the maximum number of matches our cow can win based on the positions of these two cows.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where no cows have a higher rating than `x` by returning `n - 1`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where only one cow has a higher rating than `x` by considering the position of this cow and the position of our cow.
   - The function correctly handles the case where two cows have higher ratings than `x` by considering the positions of these two cows and the position of our cow.

5. **Optimal Swap**:
   - The function aims to find the optimal position to swap our cow to maximize its wins. This is done by considering the positions of the cows with higher ratings.
   - The logic to determine the maximum number of wins is based on the positions of these higher-rated cows and the position of our cow.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The condition `if k == 14:` is a debugging statement and should not be part of the final solution. However, it does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.
   - The function `func_1` does not explicitly perform the swap, but it calculates the maximum number of wins based on the optimal swap position, which is sufficient for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying the optimal position for our cow to maximize its wins. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
