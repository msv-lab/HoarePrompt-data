#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and an integer `k` (not explicitly passed as a parameter but assumed to be available in the function scope). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
1. If no elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
2. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is not 0, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
3. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
4. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
5. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
6. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and the first index is 0, it returns the minimum of the second index minus 1 and `k - 1`.
7. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is greater than the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and the difference between the second and first indices.
8. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is less than or equal to the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and `k - ind[0]`.

Additionally, if `k` is 14, the function prints the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]` (or all such elements if fewer than two).
