#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of bullets you can fire per second; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster; x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))

        success = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each test case, `n` and `k` were the input integers, `healths` and `positions` were the lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` and `health` are the values from the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last `position`, `time_available` is equal to the last `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the last `health`, and `success` is True if the total bullets used did not exceed the time available for any monster, otherwise `success` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the firing rate `k` (bullets per second), followed by the healths of the monsters and their initial positions. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by firing bullets at them, considering the time it takes for the bullets to reach each monster based on their positions. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the available time, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
