Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If at any point `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, `success` is False and the loop exits. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, and `monsters` remain unchanged. The `total_bullets_used` will be the sum of the healths of all monsters that were processed before the loop either completed or exited. The variable `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completed all iterations without breaking, otherwise it will be the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited. The `position` and `health` will be the position and health of the last monster processed, respectively. The `distance` will be the absolute value of this `position`, and `time_available` will be equal to this `distance`. The `bullets_needed` will be equal to the `health` of the last monster processed. If at any point during the loop, the sum of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, `success` will be set to False and the loop will exit. If the loop completes without this condition being met, `success` will remain True.
