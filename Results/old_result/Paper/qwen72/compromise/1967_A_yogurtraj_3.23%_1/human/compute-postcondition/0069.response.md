Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `k` is now `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[2]` to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `r` is now the second element of the sorted list `a`.
