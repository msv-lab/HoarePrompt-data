Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[2] + (-2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) % 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `r` is `a[3]`, `y` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `rem` is 0, and `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.***
