The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 0, `y` becomes `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**
