Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[0] + k // 1`, which is `a[0] + k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
