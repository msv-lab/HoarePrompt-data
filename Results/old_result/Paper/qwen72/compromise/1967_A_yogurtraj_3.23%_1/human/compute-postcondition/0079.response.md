Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is either `n - 3` or 0, `k` is either 0 or \( k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2]) \), `r` is either `a[2] + (0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3` or `a[3]`, and `rem` is either `(0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) % 3` or 0. If \((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k\), then `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + (0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `rem` is `(0 - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])) % 3`, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `y` remains 0, `k` is updated to \( k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1]) - 3 * (a[3] - a[2]) \), `r` is `a[3]`, and `rem` remains 0.***
