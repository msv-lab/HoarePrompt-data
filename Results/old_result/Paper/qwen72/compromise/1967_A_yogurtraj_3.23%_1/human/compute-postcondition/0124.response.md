Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`), `y` is 0, and `rem` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `k` is not 0.**
