Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input, `k` is the second integer from user input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the final value of `r` after the loop completes, `rem` is the final value of `rem` after the loop completes, `y` is the final value of `y` after the loop completes, the user input must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The list `a` now contains the integers provided by the user.
- The initial state variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the user input must be greater than 1 is still valid.
