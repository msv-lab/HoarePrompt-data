To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., `n - 1 >= 1`), which simplifies to `n >= 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `ii` is 0
- `n` and `k` are input integers
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `r` is the first element of `a`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
