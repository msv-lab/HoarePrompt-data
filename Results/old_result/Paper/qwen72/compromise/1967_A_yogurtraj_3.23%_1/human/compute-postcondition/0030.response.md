The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `y` is `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + (-2 * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `rem` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1]) % 3`, `k` is `-2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.**
