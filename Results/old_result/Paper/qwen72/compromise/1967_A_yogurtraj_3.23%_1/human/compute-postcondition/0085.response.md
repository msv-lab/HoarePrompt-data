To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `ii` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is \(n - 1\).
- `y` is either \(n - 1 - j\) where \(j\) is the index at which the condition \((j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k\) was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met.
- `k` is 0.
- `r` is the value of \(a[j] + k // (j + 1)\) if the condition was met at index \(j\), or the last element of `a` if the condition was never met.
- `rem` is either \(k \% (j + 1)\) if the condition was met at index \(j\), or 0 if the condition was never met.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `y` and `r`:**
   - The condition \((j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k\) is checked for each index \(j\) in the list `a`.
   - Since `k` is 0, the condition simplifies to \((j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > 0\).
   - This condition will always be true for any valid \(j\) because \(a[j + 1] - a[j]\) is positive (since `a` is sorted and contains distinct integers).
   - Therefore, the condition will be met at the first index \(j = 0\).

2. **Calculate `y` and `r` based on the condition being met at \(j = 0\):**
   - `y` is \(n - 1 - 0 = n - 1\).
   - `r` is \(a[0] + k // (0 + 1) = a[0] + 0 = a[0]\).
   - `rem` is \(k \% (0 + 1) = 0 \% 1 = 0\).

3. **Substitute the values into the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `r = a[0]`
     - `y = n - 1`
     - `rem = 0`
   - The expression becomes: \((a[0] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + (n - 1)\).

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   - \((a[0] - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1)\)
   - Simplify further: \((a[0] - 1) * n + n\)
   - Factor out \(n\): \(n * (a[0] - 1 + 1)\)
   - Simplify: \(n * a[0]\)

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the product of `n` and the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **n * a[0]** (where `n` is the first integer from user input and `a[0]` is the first element of the sorted list `a`)
