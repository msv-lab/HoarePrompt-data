Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is either `n - 1 - j` where `j` is the index at which the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met, or 0 if the condition was never met, `k` is either 0 if the condition was met, or the remaining value after subtracting the cumulative differences up to the last iteration, `r` is the value of `a[j] + k // (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or the last element of `a` if the condition was never met, and `rem` is either `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, or 0 if the condition was never met.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `ii` remains 1.
- The variable `n` remains the first integer from user input, which must be greater than 1.
- The variable `a` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop completes all iterations.
- The variable `y` will be `n - 1 - j` if the condition `(j + 1) * (a[j + 1] - a[j]) > k` was first met at index `j`, otherwise it will be 0.
- The variable `k` will be 0 if the condition was met, otherwise it will be the remaining value after subtracting the cumulative differences up to the last iteration.
- The variable `r` will be the value of `a[j] + k // (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, otherwise it will be the last element of `a`.
- The variable `rem` will be `k % (j + 1)` if the condition was met at index `j`, otherwise it will be 0.
