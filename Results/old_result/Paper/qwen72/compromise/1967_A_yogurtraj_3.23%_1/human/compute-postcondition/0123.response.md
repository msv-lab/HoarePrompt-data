Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`), `y` is 0, and `rem` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
- If the condition is true, the loop updates `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k`, and breaks out of the loop.
- If the condition is false, the loop decreases `k` by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and updates `r` to `a[i + 1]`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`, `k` will be 0 (since it gets decremented until it reaches 0 or less), `r` will be the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`), `y` will be 0, and `rem` will be 0.
