Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from user input and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k % 2`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `y` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 1 - 1`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
