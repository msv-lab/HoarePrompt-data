The function `func_1` takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns an integer representing the total cost of rearranging the string such that all '1's are moved to the front and all '0's are moved to the back. The cost is calculated as the sum of `(right - left + 1)` for each swap operation performed during the rearrangement process. After the function executes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, but internally, the function creates a list `s` that initially contains the characters of `sChar` in the same order. By the end of the function, `s` will have all '1's at the beginning and all '0's at the end, and the variable `left` will hold the number of '1's in the string.
