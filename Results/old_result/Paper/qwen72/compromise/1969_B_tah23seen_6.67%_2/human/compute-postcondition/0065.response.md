Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the last '1' in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no more '1's exist, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.**

### Explanation:
- **`sChar` and `s`**: These strings remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`left`**: The loop increments `left` until it either finds a '1' or reaches the end of the string `s`. After the loop completes, `left` will be the index of the last '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no more '1's are found.
- **`right`**: This variable is not directly modified by the loop, but it is assumed to be updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists. This assumption holds true even after the loop completes.
- **`cost`**: The `cost` is incremented by the value of `right - left + 1` for each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `cost` will reflect the total sum of these increments.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations is as described above.
