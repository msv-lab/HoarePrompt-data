Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.**

### Explanation:
- **`sChar`**: The binary string `sChar` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as the loop does not modify `sChar`.
- **`s`**: The list `s` also remains unchanged, as the loop only modifies the indices `left` and `right`, not the contents of `s`.
- **`left`**: After the loop finishes, `left` will be the index of the first '1' in `s`. If there is no '1' in `s`, `left` will be equal to `len(s)`.
- **`right`**: The value of `right` remains the same as it was initially, which is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found. The loop only increments `left` and does not affect `right`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described above.
