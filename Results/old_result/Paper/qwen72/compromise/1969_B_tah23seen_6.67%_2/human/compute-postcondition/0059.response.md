To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `left`: This is an index in the string `s`.
   - `len(s)`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `s[left]`: The character at the `left` index in the string `s`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `s` contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
   - `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`.
   - `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists.
   - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute if `left` is less than `len(s)` and the character at `s[left]` is not '1'.
   - Given that `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s`, the condition `s[left] != '1'` will initially be false.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To make the loop execute, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1'.
   - Since `left` is already less than `len(s)`, we do not need to adjust `left` or `len(s)`.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `s[left]` to be a character other than '1'. However, since we cannot directly change the content of `s` (as it is derived from `sChar`), we need to ensure that `left` points to a position where `s[left]` is not '1'.

Given the constraints, the only feasible adjustment is to ensure that `left` points to a position where `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `left` is initially an index where a '1' exists, we need to find the next index where `s[left]` is not '1'.

### Adjusted State:
Since we cannot directly change `s`, we need to ensure that `left` is set to the next index where `s[left]` is not '1'. However, without changing the content of `s`, this is not possible. Therefore, the loop will not execute if `left` is initially pointing to a '1'.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the loop will not execute unless `left` is adjusted to point to a different index where `s[left]` is not '1'. Since we cannot change `s`, the loop will not execute under the given conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is an index where a '1' exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is updated to the next index where a '0' exists in `s` or is equal to `len(s)` if no such '0' exists, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `cost` is increased by the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.** 

However, the loop will not execute because `s[left]` is '1'.
