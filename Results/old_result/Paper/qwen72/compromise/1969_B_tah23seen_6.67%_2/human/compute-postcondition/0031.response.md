The code snippet swaps the elements at indices `left` and `right` in the list `s`. 

- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1.

After the swap:

- The character at index `left` in `s` will now be '0'.
- The character at index `right` in `s` will now be '1'.

All other variables (`sChar`, `left`, `right`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` with the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2.**
