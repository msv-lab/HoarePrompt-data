To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `right < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that the index `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - Given that `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), and `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar`, the length of `s` is at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - Since `right` is initially 1 (as stated in the problem), `right < len(s)` will always be true because the minimum length of `s` is 2.

2. **Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'.
   - Given that `s` is a list of characters from the binary string `sChar`, and `right` is initially 1, we need to ensure that `s[1]` is not '0' for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `s[right]` (which is `s[1]` since `right` is 1).
- To ensure the loop executes, `s[1]` must be '1'.

### Final State:
Since the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s[1]` is '1', the final state is:

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `cost` is 2, and `s[1]` must be '1'**.
