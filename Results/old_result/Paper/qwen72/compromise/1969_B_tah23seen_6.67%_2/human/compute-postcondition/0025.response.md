To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `left`: The current index being checked.
   - `len(s)`: The length of the list `s`.
   - `s[left]`: The character at the current index `left`.

2. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - `left < len(s)`: This ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - `s[left] != '1'`: This ensures that the character at index `left` is not '1'.

3. **Current State:**
   - `left` is 1.
   - `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `s[0]` must not be '1'.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Additionally, `s[left]` must not be '1'.

### Current State Analysis:
- `left` is 1, which is less than `len(s)`.
- We need to ensure that `s[left]` (i.e., `s[1]`) is not '1'.

### Conclusion:
- Since `left` is already 1 and less than `len(s)`, we only need to ensure that `s[1]` is not '1'.
- If `s[1]` is not '1', the loop will execute one more time.

### Final State:
- No adjustments are needed to `left` or `len(s)`.
- The only requirement is that `s[1]` must not be '1'.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the previous iteration, with the additional note that `s[1]` must not be '1'.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`, `left` is 1, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2, and `s[1]` must not be '1'.**
