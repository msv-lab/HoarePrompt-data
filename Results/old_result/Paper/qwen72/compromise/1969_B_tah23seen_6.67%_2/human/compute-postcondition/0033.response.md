Postcondition: ***`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at indices `left` and `right` in `s` are swapped, and `cost` is updated to `2 + (right - left + 1)`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `cost` remains 2. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.***
