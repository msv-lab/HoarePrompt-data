Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second character of `sChar`, `s` is a list containing the first and second characters of `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code appends the second character of `sChar` (stored in `i`) to the list `s`, which initially contains only the first character of `sChar`. After the code executes, `s` now contains both the first and second characters of `sChar`. The values of `sChar` and `i` remain unchanged.
