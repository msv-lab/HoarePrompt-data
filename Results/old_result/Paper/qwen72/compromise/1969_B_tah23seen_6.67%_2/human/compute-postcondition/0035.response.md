Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order. `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, and `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, plus 1. `right` must be an index where `s[right]` is not '0'.**
