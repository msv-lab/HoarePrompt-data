You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (consisting of '0' and '1') with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order as they appear in `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1

        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, but with all '1's moved to the front and all '0's moved to the back, `left` is equal to the number of '1's in `s`, `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `cost` is the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total sum of `right - left + 1` for each iteration until the loop condition is no longer met, where `left` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, and `right` is the length of the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns an integer representing the total cost of rearranging the string such that all '1's are moved to the front and all '0's are moved to the back. The cost is calculated as the sum of `(right - left + 1)` for each swap operation performed during the rearrangement process. After the function executes, the input string `sChar` remains unchanged, but internally, the function creates a list `s` that initially contains the characters of `sChar` in the same order. By the end of the function, `s` will have all '1's at the beginning and all '0's at the end, and the variable `left` will hold the number of '1's in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Each operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the cost.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `s` and appends each character of the input string `sChar` to it. This converts the string into a list of characters.
   - **Variables**:
     - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
     - `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both pointers are within the bounds of the string.
     - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', a swap is performed between `s[right]` and `s[left]`, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
     - The `right` pointer is moved to the next '0' character.
     - The `left` pointer is moved to the next '1' character.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the total cost.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The logic of swapping elements and moving pointers is not sufficient to ensure that the string is sorted correctly. The algorithm does not consider all possible substrings and their costs effectively.
   - The approach of swapping individual elements does not align with the requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the optimal substrings to cyclically shift to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost.
   - A more efficient approach involves finding the longest prefix that can be shifted to the end to form a sorted string and calculating the cost accordingly.

Given the logical flaws in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
