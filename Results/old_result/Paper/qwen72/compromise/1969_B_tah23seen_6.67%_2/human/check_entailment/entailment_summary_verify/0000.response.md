### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

#### Function Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Input**: A binary string `sChar`.
  - **Output**: An integer representing the total cost to sort the string.
  - **Internal Logic**:
    - Convert the string `sChar` to a list `s`.
    - Initialize `left` and `right` pointers.
    - Iterate through the string to find positions where `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`.
    - Swap these elements and update the cost.
    - Move the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**:
   - The program swaps elements `s[right]` and `s[left]` whenever `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`. This approach does not guarantee that the string will be sorted in non-descending order.
   - For example, consider the string `101011`. The program might swap elements incorrectly, leading to an unsorted string.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` is not always correct. The cost should be the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, but the current implementation might not always reflect the correct length of the substring being shifted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the string is already sorted, the program should return 0, but it might not do so correctly due to the flawed logic.

#### Example Case:
Consider the input string `101011`:
- The correct output should be 5.
- The program might produce a different result due to the flawed logic.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify all substrings that need to be cyclically shifted.
2. Ensure the string is sorted in non-descending order after all operations.
3. Calculate the cost accurately based on the length of the substrings being shifted.

A correct approach would involve:
- Finding the longest prefix of '1's and the longest suffix of '0's.
- Calculating the cost to move the remaining '1's to the front and '0's to the back.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has logical flaws that prevent it from correctly sorting the binary string and calculating the cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
