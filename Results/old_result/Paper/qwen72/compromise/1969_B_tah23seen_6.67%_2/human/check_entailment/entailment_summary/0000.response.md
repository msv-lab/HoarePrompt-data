Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of sorting a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as specified:

1. **Incorrect Cyclic Shift Implementation**: The function attempts to swap elements directly rather than performing a cyclic shift. A cyclic shift involves moving the last element of a substring to the front, not swapping two elements. This means the function does not actually perform the required operation.

2. **Logic Flaw in Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on the direct swap of elements, which does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift. The cost should be calculated based on the length of the substring being shifted, not the distance between the elements being swapped.

3. **Termination Condition**: The while loop conditions are not robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly when the string is already sorted or when the string has no '1's or '0's to swap.

4. **Incorrect Output**: The function does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string. It may prematurely terminate or incorrectly calculate the cost, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
