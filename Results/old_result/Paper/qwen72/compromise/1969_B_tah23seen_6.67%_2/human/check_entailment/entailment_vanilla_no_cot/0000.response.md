Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the cost of sorting the binary string. The algorithm attempts to swap elements directly when it finds a '1' followed by a '0', but this approach does not account for the optimal way to use cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

A more efficient approach would involve calculating the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the end of the string, which can be done by identifying the longest contiguous segment of '1's that can be moved to the end with minimal cost. This involves a different strategy than the direct swapping used in the provided code.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(sChar):
    n = len(sChar)
    # Count the number of 1s in the string
    count_ones = sChar.count('1')
    
    # If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0
    if count_ones == 0 or count_ones == n:
        return 0
    
    # Find the minimum cost to sort the string
    min_cost = float('inf')
    ones_in_window = 0
    for i in range(2 * n):
        if sChar[i % n] == '1':
            ones_in_window += 1
        if i >= count_ones:
            if sChar[(i - count_ones) % n] == '1':
                ones_in_window -= 1
        if i >= count_ones - 1:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, count_ones - ones_in_window)
    
    return min_cost + count_ones

# Main program
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This corrected version calculates the minimum cost by considering the sliding window technique to find the optimal segment of the string that needs to be cyclically shifted to achieve the sorted order. This approach ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.
