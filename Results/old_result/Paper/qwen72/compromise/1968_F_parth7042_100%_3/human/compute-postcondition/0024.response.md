Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `index` is `index + 1`, `mp[pf[i]]` now contains the value `i` appended to its previous list.**

In natural language:
- The value of `a[i]` is now the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The value of `pf[i]` is updated to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` and the new value of `a[i]`.
- The value of `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1.
- The list `mp[pf[i]]` now includes the value `i` appended to its previous contents.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` remains valid.
