Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- `a[i]` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operation.
- `i` is appended to the list `mp[pf[i]]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` remains valid.
