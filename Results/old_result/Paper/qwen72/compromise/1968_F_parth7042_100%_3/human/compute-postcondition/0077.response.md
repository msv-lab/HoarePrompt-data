Output State: **`index` is `3 + 2*q`, `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3, `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is `q - 1`, `q` is the number of iterations the loop was set to execute, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*(q-1)]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*(q-1)]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the value `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions evaluated in each iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The `index` variable will be `3 + 2*q` after the loop has completed all `q` iterations, as it increments by 2 in each iteration.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, still containing the integer values from the `data` list starting from index 3.
- The list `pf` also remains unchanged, still containing the cumulative XOR of elements in `a`.
- The dictionary `mp` remains unchanged, still mapping each value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value occurs.
- The loop variable `_` will be `q - 1` after the loop completes, as it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The variable `q` remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of iterations the loop was set to execute.
- The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last iteration, specifically `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*(q-1)]` and `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2*(q-1)]`.
- The variable `x` will be the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` from the last iteration.
- The lists `v1` and `v2` will contain the indices from `mp` corresponding to `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` from the last iteration, respectively.
- The variables `it1` and `it2` will be the indices in `v1` and `v2` where `l` and `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, or the adjusted index for `it2` as `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
- The list `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration. Each element in `results` corresponds to whether the conditions for that specific iteration were met.
