The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `queries` is a list of tuples. Each `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each `q` satisfies 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, each element in `a` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` with 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output of processing one test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains four elements: `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results.**
