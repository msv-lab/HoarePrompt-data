Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input data, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list of integers `a`, and a list of query tuples `queries`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero. If the XOR is zero, or if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`, the function appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the function prints the results, one per line. The final state of the program is that `index` is `7 + 2*t*q` and `results` is a list of strings 'YES' or 'NO' with length `t*q`. **
