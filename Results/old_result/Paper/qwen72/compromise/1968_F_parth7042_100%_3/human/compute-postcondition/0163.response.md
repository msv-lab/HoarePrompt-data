Output State: **`index` is `8 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, `mp[pf[1]]` contains the list `[1, 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list in `mp` at the key `pf[i]`.
- Given that `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q])`.
- The list at `mp[pf[1]]` already contains `[1]`, so after appending `i` (which is 1), the list becomes `[1, 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
