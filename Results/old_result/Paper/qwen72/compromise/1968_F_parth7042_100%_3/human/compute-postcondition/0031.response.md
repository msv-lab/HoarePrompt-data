Output State: **`index` is `3 + n`, `a` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the integer value of the corresponding element in `data` starting from index 3, `pf` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` from index 1 to the current index, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that `pf` value occurs, `_` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
