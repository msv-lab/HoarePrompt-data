Output State: **`index` is `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values, `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 0]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is `int(data[7 + 2*q + n + 2*q + 1])`, `results` contains the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the loop body, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.** 

The value of `a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index])`, where `index` is `7 + 2*q + n + 2*q`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
