Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Output Format**: The program should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case, but it prints the list `k` instead.
2. **Shape Detection Logic**: The program checks if the first two counts of '1's in the list `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square. This is not sufficient to determine the shape correctly. For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, and for a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of a triangle (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ... for an upside-down triangle).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Find the row and column indices of all '1's
        ones = [(r, c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n) if grid[r][c] == '1']
        
        # Determine the size of the shape
        min_row = min(ones, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
        max_row = max(ones, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
        min_col = min(ones, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
        max_col = max(ones, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
        
        k = max_row - min_row + 1
        
        # Check if the shape is a square
        if k == max_col - min_col + 1:
            # Check if all rows have exactly k '1's
            if all(row.count('1') == k for row in grid[min_row:max_row+1]):
                print("SQUARE")
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            # Check if the shape is a triangle
            if all(len(row) - row.rfind('1') - row.find('1') + 1 == 2 * (i - min_row) + 1 for i, row in enumerate(grid[min_row:max_row+1])):
                print("TRIANGLE")
            elif all(len(row) - row.rfind('1') - row.find('1') + 1 == 2 * (max_row - i) + 1 for i, row in enumerate(grid[min_row:max_row+1])):
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("SQUARE")

func()
```

This corrected version:
1. Collects all the '1's in the grid.
2. Determines the bounds of the shape.
3. Checks if the shape is a square by verifying if all rows within the bounds have the same number of '1's.
4. Checks if the shape is a triangle by verifying if the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern of a triangle (either normal or upside-down).

This should correctly determine the shape for each test case.
