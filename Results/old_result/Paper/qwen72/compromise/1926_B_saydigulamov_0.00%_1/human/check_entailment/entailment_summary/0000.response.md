Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the grid size and the grid itself. It counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. However, the program only checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This does not determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle as required by the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve:
1. **Identifying the shape**: For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same and greater than 1. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a sequence where the count of '1's in the i-th row is `2 * i - 1` (or in reverse for an upside-down triangle).
2. **Outputting the result**: The program should print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.

The current program does not perform these checks and instead prints the list of counts, which is not the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
