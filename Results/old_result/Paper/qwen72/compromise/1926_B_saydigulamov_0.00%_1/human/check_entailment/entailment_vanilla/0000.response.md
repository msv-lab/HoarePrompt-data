### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters (either '0' or '1').

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program appends the count of '1's in each row to a list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.
   - After reading all the rows, it checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.

3. **Output**:
   - If `k[0] == k[1]`, it prints the list `k`.

### Issues:
- **Output Mismatch**:
  - The program is supposed to output "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.
  - However, the program prints the list `k` instead of the required output.

- **Shape Detection Logic**:
  - The program only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square.
  - This logic is insufficient because:
    - A square should have all elements in `k` equal.
    - A triangle should have elements in `k` forming a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) or (5, 3, 1, ...).

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly determine the shape and does not produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness: **False**
