Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z', and `decoded` is a list containing the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `encoded` string remains unchanged.
- The `mapping` dictionary will contain a mapping from each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'. Each character in `encoded` will be mapped to a different letter, and the letters will be assigned in the order they are encountered in `encoded`.
- The `decoded` list will contain the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded`, based on the mappings established in `mapping`. If a character in `encoded` is encountered for the first time, it will be mapped to the next available lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a'. If a character is encountered again, the list will append the letter it was previously mapped to.
