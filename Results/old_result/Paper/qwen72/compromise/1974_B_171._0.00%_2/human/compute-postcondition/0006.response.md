The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the range of values it will iterate over, which is from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This range is fixed and will always include 26 iterations (from the ASCII value of 'a' to 'z' inclusive). Therefore, the loop will always execute regardless of the initial state of `encoded`, `mapping`, or `decoded`.

However, the task specifies that we need to ensure the loop can execute, and the only relevant state to consider here is the initialization of `c`. The loop will start with `c` being the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97).

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary, `c` is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a')**
