The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `encoded`. For the loop to execute, the string `encoded` must have at least one character. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. Since `char` is the variable that will take the value of each character in `encoded` during the loop, it does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts. However, for the loop to execute, `encoded` must not be empty.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
