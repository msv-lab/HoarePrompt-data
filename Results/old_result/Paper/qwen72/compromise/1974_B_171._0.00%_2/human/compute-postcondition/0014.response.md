Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char` and the key 'b' mapped to `char`, and `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary except for the keys 'a' and 'b'. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged.***
