The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. Each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'. The returned string is the result of replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped letter.
