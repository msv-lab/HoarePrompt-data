Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The program's current logic only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes), which is insufficient to determine if Nikita can achieve a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The problem description specifies that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. This means that after an even number of moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only change by an even number (e.g., 0, 2, 4, etc.), and after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes can only change by an odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.). Therefore, for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.

The original assessment provides two examples to illustrate the issue:
1. For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program outputs "Yes" because `n` is less than `m`. However, it is impossible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves, so the correct output should be "No".
2. For `n = 3` and `m = 1`, the program outputs "Yes" because `n` is greater than `m`. However, it is impossible to have exactly 1 cube after 3 moves, so the correct output should be "No".

The suggested correction in the original assessment is accurate:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected logic ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct in identifying the flaw and providing the correct logic to fix it.

Final: **False**
