Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, and `a` and `b` retain their initial values unless modified as follows: If `s.count('1') == 1`, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, `b` is set to 'SQUARE' and `a` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1')` is neither 1 nor greater than 1, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
