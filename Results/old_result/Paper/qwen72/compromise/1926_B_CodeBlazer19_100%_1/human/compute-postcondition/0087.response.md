Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, then `b` is set to 'SQUARE' and `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
