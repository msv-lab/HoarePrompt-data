Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `s` is the last input string provided by the user.
   - If any input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
   - If no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0.
   - If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
   - Additionally, `a` is 0.

2. **Determine the value of `b`:**
   - The initial state specifies that `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character.
   - If no input string `s` contains more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
   - Since the initial state also mentions that `a` is 0, it implies that no input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character.
   - Therefore, the only condition left is whether any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character. If not, `b` remains an empty string.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `a` is 0, it means no input string `s` contains exactly one '1' character.
   - Since `b` is only set to 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` contains more than one '1' character, and there is no information suggesting that such a string exists, `b` remains an empty string.

Therefore, the output of the `print(b)` statement will be:

Output: **'' (an empty string)**
