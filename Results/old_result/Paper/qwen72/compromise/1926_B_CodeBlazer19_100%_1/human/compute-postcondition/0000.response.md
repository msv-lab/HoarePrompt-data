The code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This value represents the number of test cases, and according to the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. After executing the code, the value of `t` is now specifically the integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.**
