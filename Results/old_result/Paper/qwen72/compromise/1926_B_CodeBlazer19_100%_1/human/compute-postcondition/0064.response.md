Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If no input string `s` has more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string. If no input string `s` has exactly one '1', `a` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer.
- The value of `j` is calculated as `n-1`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for setting `a` and `b` based on the count of '1' characters in `s` remain the same.
