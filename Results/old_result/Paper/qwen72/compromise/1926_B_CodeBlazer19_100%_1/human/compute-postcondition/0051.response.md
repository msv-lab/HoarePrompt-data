The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is a new input string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is greater than 1, `a` is set to 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If the count of '1' characters in `s` is 0, `a` is set to 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
