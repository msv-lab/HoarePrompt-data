Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each row of the grid and checking the count of '1's in each row. However, the logic used to determine the shape is flawed:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. This condition alone is insufficient to identify a triangle because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. For example, a triangle with \( k = 3 \) will have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively.

2. **Square Detection**: The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1'. For instance, a triangle with \( k = 3 \) will have a row with 3 '1's.

3. **Final Output**: The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' otherwise. This logic fails to correctly identify the shape based on the problem's definition.

To correctly identify the shape, the program should:
- Check for the presence of a triangle by verifying the pattern of '1's in the grid.
- Check for the presence of a square by verifying that each row has the same number of consecutive '1's.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
