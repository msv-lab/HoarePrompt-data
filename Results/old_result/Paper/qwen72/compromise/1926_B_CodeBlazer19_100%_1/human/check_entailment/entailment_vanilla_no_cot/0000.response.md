Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square based on the given problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**:
   - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1' (`s.count('1') == 1`) and sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This logic is flawed because a triangle can have more than one '1' in a row.
   - The program checks if any row has more than one '1' (`s.count('1') > 1`) and sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This logic is also flawed because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and a square must have the same number of '1's in each row.

2. **Handling of Multiple Rows**:
   - The program does not consider the overall structure of the grid. It only looks at individual rows and makes decisions based on the count of '1's in each row, which is insufficient to determine the shape.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is set, otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'. This logic is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the shape is a triangle but no row has exactly one '1'.

To correctly identify the shape, the program should:
- Check the overall structure of the grid to see if it forms a triangle or a square.
- Verify the conditions for both shapes as described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid, n):
    # Check for a normal triangle
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for start_row in range(n - k + 1):
            for start_col in range(n - 2 * k + 2):
                if all(grid[start_row + i][start_col + k - i - 1] == '1' for i in range(k)):
                    return True
    # Check for an upside-down triangle
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for start_row in range(k - 1, n):
            for start_col in range(n - 2 * k + 2):
                if all(grid[start_row - i][start_col + k - i - 1] == '1' for i in range(k)):
                    return True
    return False

def is_square(grid, n):
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for start_row in range(n - k + 1):
            for start_col in range(n - k + 1):
                if all(grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] == '1' for i in range(k) for j in range(k)):
                    return True
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This corrected version includes functions to check if the grid forms a triangle or a square, and it uses these functions to determine the shape correctly.
