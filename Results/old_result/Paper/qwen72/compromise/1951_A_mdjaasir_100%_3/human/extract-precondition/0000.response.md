It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition you provided is `def func():`. Let's correct this and extract the precondition based on the problem description and the intended function definition.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to generate Python files for each `.html` file found in subfolders of the current directory, where the subfolder names are within a specified range. The function checks if the subfolder names are digits and fall within the range `[start, end]`. For each `.html` file in these subfolders, it creates two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name of the HTML file, and another with `-wa.py` appended.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that are digits.**
