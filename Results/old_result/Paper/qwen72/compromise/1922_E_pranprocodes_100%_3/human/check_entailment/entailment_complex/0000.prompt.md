Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `i` is the number of test cases - 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (total number of even `x` values encountered across all test cases), `min` is -100000000 + (total number of odd `x` values encountered across all test cases), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x` for the last test case, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for the last `x` to become 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers that, when reversed, forms an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself. If no such sequence can be generated, the function does not handle this case explicitly and will still print a sequence. The elements of the sequence are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the sequence is constructed by decrementing a maximum value for even X and incrementing a minimum value for odd X.
