The code snippet `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Based on the initial state, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. After decrementing `x` by 1, the new value of `x` will be `x - 1`. Since `x` was greater than 1, `x - 1` will still be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999, -100000000]` if the original `x` was even; `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if the original `x` was odd.**
