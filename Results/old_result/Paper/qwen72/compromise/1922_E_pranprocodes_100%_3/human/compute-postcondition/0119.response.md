Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers that, when reversed, forms an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself. If no such sequence can be generated, the function does not handle this case explicitly and will still print a sequence. The elements of the sequence are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the sequence is constructed by decrementing a maximum value for even X and incrementing a minimum value for odd X. **
