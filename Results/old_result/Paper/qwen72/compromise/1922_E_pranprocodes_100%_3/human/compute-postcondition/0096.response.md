The code snippet `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, and 100000000 if `x` is odd. The list `ans` initially contains `[100000000]` if `x` is even, and `[-100000000]` if `x` is odd. After appending `max`, the list `ans` will contain either `[100000000, 99999999]` if `x` is even, or `[-100000000, 100000000]` if `x` is odd. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999]`, and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `[-100000000, 100000000]`, and `t` is 1.**
