Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**

The value of `min` has been reset to -100000000, and all other variables remain unchanged.
