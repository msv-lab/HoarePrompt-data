Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is now `x // 2` (where `x` is an input integer greater than 1 and even), `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999]`, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (since `x` is even).
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
