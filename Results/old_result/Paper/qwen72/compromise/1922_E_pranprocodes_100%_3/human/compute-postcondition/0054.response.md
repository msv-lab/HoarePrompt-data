Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, and `t` is 0. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `t` is 0, and `x` remains unchanged.***
