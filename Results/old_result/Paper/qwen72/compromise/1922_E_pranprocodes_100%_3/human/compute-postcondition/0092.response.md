Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and is an even integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `t` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `x` is initially an input integer greater than 1 and is an odd integer.
- The code `x -= 1` subtracts 1 from `x`, making `x` an even integer.
- Since `x` was initially greater than 1, after subtracting 1, `x` is now greater than 0.
- The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.
