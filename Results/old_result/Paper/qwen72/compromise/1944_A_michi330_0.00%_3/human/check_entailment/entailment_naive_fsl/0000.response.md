Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still significant enough to isolate some islands. Specifically, the program always prints \( n - 1 \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \). According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy up to 3 bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit. If Dominater destroys the bridges between:

- Island 1 and Island 2
- Island 1 and Island 3
- Island 1 and Island 4

Everule will only be able to visit Island 1 and Island 5, resulting in a total of 2 islands. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The correct logic should consider the number of bridges that can be destroyed to isolate Everule from as many islands as possible. The minimum number of islands Everule can visit is determined by the number of bridges that can be destroyed to isolate Everule from the other islands. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule can be isolated to only one island. Otherwise, the number of islands Everule can visit is \( n - k \) if \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \).
