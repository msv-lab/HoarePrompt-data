The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `k`, and `t` is a specific integer provided by the user. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
