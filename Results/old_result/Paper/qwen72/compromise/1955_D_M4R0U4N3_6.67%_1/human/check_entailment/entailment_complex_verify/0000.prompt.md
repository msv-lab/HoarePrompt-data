You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. The conditions are 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. The function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.

        for r in range(m, n):

            if old in extra:
                extra.remove(old)
            elif old in done:
                done.remove(old)
                todo.add(old)
            if a[r] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])

    #State: The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` that contain at least `k` elements from the set `todo`. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values for each test case, while the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset for each new test case. The variable `ans` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case and is used to accumulate the count of valid subarrays, which is printed at the end of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. It then counts the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements from the set `b`. After processing each test case, it prints the count of such valid subarrays. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values for each test case, while the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where elements in array `b` are not unique. The program uses sets to track elements, which inherently removes duplicates. This can lead to incorrect results when there are duplicate elements in `b` that need to be matched in the subsegments of `a`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 2 4
```
The correct output should be `3` because the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 all contain at least 3 elements that match the elements in `b` (after rearrangement). However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly treats the duplicate `2` in `b` as a single element.

To fix this, the program should use a `Counter` to track the frequency of elements in `b` and ensure that the subsegments of `a` contain at least `k` elements that match the required frequencies.
