Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization of Sets**:
   - `todo` is initialized as a set of elements from `b`.
   - `done` and `extra` are initialized as empty sets.

3. **Initial Window Check**:
   - The function iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on whether the elements are in `todo` or not.
   - It correctly initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial window contains at least `k` elements from `b`, otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` by removing the old element (`a[r - m]`) and adding the new element.
   - It correctly increments `ans` if the current window contains at least `k` elements from `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, the function prints the value of `ans`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `m == n` correctly by ensuring that the initial window is processed and the result is printed.
   - It also handles the case where `k == m` correctly by ensuring that all elements in the window must match the elements in `b`.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` ensures that the operations (add, remove, and check membership) are efficient, typically O(1) on average.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that the function processes each subarray in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for updating the sets and counting the valid subarrays is correct. The function ensures that the sets are updated correctly as the window slides over the array `a`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
