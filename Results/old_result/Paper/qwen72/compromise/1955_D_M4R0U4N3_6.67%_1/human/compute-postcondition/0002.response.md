The function `func` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k`. The conditions are 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. The function is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the example.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` of length `n`, a list of integers `b` of length `m`, and an integer `k` where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. It is intended to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the given context.**
