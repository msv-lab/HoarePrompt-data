Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To correctly solve the problem, the function should be defined with parameters for n and m, and potentially an additional parameter for the number of test cases t. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # cases is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (n, m)
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.**
