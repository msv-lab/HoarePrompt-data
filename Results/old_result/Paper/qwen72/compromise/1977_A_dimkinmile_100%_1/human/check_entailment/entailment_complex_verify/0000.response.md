### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition Order:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. This will indeed result in a runtime error. The function should be defined before it is called.

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not entirely correct for the given problem description.
   - The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:
     - `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to build a tower of at least `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect must be an even number of changes to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case `n = 2` and `m = 1`:
     - The original condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` evaluates to `1 % 2 == 0 and 1 >= 0`, which is `False` (since `1 % 2 == 1`).
     - The correct condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` evaluates to `2 >= 1 and (2 - 1) % 2 == 0`, which is `True` (since `1 % 2 == 1` is `False`, but `2 >= 1` is `True` and `(2 - 1) % 2 == 1` is `False`).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic inside `func_1`, but they do not address the order of function definition or the logical error in the condition.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Function Definition Order:**
  - The function `func_1` should be defined before it is called to avoid a runtime error.

- **Correct Condition:**
  - The correct condition should be `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the function definition order and the logical condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
