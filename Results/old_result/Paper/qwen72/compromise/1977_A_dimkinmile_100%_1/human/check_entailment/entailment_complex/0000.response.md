Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The core of the solution lies in the condition checked by the program: whether the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` is used to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **Even Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being even is crucial because each move (adding or removing a cube) changes the number of cubes by 1. To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves must be such that the difference between the initial and final states is even. This is because adding and removing cubes alternately will always result in an even number of changes.
   - **Non-negative Difference**: The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m` that Nikita wants to end up with. This is necessary because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints "Yes".
   - If either condition is not met, the program prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are equal, as the difference `n - m` will be 0, which is even and non-negative.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `m`, which is impossible, and prints "No".

5. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It checks the necessary conditions and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
