Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it prematurely breaks out of the loop after finding the first `y` that provides a sum greater than `max_sum`. This means it does not necessarily find the maximum possible sum of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all \(y\) in the range \([1, x-1]\). Instead, it should continue to check all possible values of \(y\) to ensure the maximum sum is found.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

In this corrected version, the `break` statement has been removed, allowing the loop to iterate through all possible values of \(y\) and find the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
