Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`, `y` is `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.** 

In natural language: The value of `current_sum` is now the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `gcd_val`, and `y`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
