The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `y` in the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was `x - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by `1`, so `y` is now `x - 2`. The loop will execute again as long as `y` is greater than `0`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.**
