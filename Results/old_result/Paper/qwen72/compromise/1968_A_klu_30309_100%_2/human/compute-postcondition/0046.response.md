The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`. The loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `y` is `x - 2`, and the loop has not broken out yet.

To execute the loop one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `y` must be `x - 3` and `x` must be at least 3 (since `x - 3` must be greater than 0).

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 3), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `gcd_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 3`, and `current_sum` is `x - 1`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `x - 1` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.**
