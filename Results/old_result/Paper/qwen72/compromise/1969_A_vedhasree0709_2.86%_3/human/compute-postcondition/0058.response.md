Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0 or 1 (unchanged)**

The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `l` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
