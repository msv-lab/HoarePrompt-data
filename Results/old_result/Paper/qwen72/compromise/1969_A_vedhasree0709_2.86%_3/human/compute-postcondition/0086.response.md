Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. The function checks if there exists any index `k` in the list `l` such that `l[k] == k + 2` and `l[k + 1] == k + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` for that test case. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function has printed either `2` or `3` for each test case, depending on the conditions met within the list `l`. **
