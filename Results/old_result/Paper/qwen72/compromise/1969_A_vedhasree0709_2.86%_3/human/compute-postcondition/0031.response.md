Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0 if there does not exist an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is 1, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `i` has been updated to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
