Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the second element of `l` is 3 and the third element of `l` is 2, then `j` is 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
