The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to control the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be incremented by 1, but the actual number of iterations is determined by the user input, not by the value of `_` itself. Therefore, the state of `_` does not need to be specified beyond it being incremented for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0 if there does not exist an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is 1.**
