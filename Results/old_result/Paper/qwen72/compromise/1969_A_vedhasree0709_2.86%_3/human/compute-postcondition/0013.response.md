The code snippet contains a `print` statement that directly prints the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `l`, `i`, `j`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **2**
