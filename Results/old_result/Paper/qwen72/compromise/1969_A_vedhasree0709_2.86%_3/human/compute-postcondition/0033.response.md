To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to check the condition `i <= n - 1` with the given program state.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `_` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 0 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop condition)

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0, the condition `0 <= n - 1` will always be true for any valid `n` (since `n` is at least 1, `n - 1` is at least 0).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user**
