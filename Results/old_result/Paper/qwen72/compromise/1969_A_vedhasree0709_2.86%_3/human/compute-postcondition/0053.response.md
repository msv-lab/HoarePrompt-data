Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. `j` is 0, meaning no element `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-2`.**
