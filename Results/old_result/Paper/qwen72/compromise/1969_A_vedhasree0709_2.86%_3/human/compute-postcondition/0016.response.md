Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2. If `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
