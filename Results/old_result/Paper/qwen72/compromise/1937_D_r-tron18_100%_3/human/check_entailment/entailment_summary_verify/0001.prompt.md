You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5). It computes a list `ans` of length `n` where each element represents the difference between the sum of indices of all '<' characters to the right of the current index and the sum of indices of all '>' characters to the left of the current index, adjusted by the total length of the string `n`. After computing the list, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \) where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the \( i \)-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either the left or right border.
   - We need to answer \( n \) queries, each placing the pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
     - It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - This function is used to calculate the cumulative sum of certain indices in the array.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s1` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `pre` with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a list to keep track of cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
     - `ans` is an array to store the results for each query.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is populated with the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of these indices.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single 0.
     - `ans` is initialized with zeros.

   - **Loop through the grid from right to left:**
     - For each cell \( i \):
       - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
       - If the cell contains '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

   - **Calculations:**
     - The calculations involve using the cumulative sums to determine the number of steps the pinball takes to leave the grid.
     - The logic for updating `preOne` and `suffZero` ensures that the cumulative sums are correctly maintained as the pinball moves and the characters are inverted.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for handling both '<' and '>' characters is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program prints the results for each query as required.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
