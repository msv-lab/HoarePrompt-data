### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a 1D grid represented by a string `s1` of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball is placed on each cell, and it moves according to the direction of the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element in `arr` and the element that is `times` positions before the last element.
     - It is used to compute the sum of indices in the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The function iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, updating the `ans` list with the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each position.
     - The logic for updating `ans` is based on the number of '>' and '<' characters to the left and right of the current position, and the cumulative sums stored in `preOne` and `suffZero`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` lists helps in efficiently calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each position.
   - The logic for handling the cases where the number of '>' characters is less than or greater than the number of '<' characters is correctly implemented.
   - The function prints the results for each test case, which matches the problem's output requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program, including the functions `func_1` and `func_2`, correctly solves the problem as described. The logic and the use of cumulative sums ensure that the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position is accurately calculated.

**Correctness: **True****
