Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `count2` is a value greater than 0 and less than `count`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.
- Additionally, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `s` and `j`**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and it is greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is an index in `s` where the character at `s[j]` is not equal to the character at `s[n - 1 - j]` and also not equal to `x`.

2. **Determining `j`**:
   - The condition for `done` being `False` implies that `j` is the first index where `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - This means `j` is the first index where the character in `s` does not match its corresponding character from the end of `s` and is not the first character of `s`.

3. **Splitting `string`**:
   - The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the original `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` is the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` is the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

### Conclusion:
- The exact value of `j` depends on the specific characters in `s` and the conditions provided.
- The output will be the two substrings of `string` split at the index `j` where `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[string[:j], string[j:]] (where j is the first index in s where s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] and s[j] is not equal to x)**
