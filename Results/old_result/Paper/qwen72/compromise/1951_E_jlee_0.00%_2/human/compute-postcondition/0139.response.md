Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is a non-negative integer, `count2` is a positive integer less than or equal to `count` with specific conditions, and `(n + 1) // 2` must be greater than 2. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
