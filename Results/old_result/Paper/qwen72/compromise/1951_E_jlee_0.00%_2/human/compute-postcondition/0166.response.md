Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s`.
- `done` is False.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `count` is a non-negative integer.
- `count2` is a non-negative integer.

The conditions given are:
- If `n` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will only execute if both of the following conditions are **not** met:
1. `n` is 1.
2. `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `s`, we need to consider the general case based on the conditions:

- If `n` is greater than 1 and `x` is equal to the last character of `s`, the `print('YES')` statement will execute.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES (if `n` is greater than 1 and `x` is equal to the last character of `s`)**
