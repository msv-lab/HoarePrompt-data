The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **1**
