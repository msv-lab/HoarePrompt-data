Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count` is 0 or greater. If `count` > 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` is set to `count` if `count` > 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, and `done` is True if `count` > 1, otherwise `done` remains False. If `count` > 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1, and `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. If `count` is 0, `count2` remains 0 and `done` remains False.***
