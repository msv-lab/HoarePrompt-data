Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
