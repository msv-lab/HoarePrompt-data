Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t > 1`
   - `i = 1`
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 4 characters.
   - `n = len(s) > 3`
   - `x = s[0]` (the first character of `s`)
   - `j = 2`
   - The conditions involving `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]` are checked, but they do not affect the `print` statement directly.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
