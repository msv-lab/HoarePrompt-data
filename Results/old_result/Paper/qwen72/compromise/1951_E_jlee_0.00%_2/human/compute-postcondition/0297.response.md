Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0 or greater, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is False.*** 

Since the condition `n == 1` is never true given the precondition that `n` is greater than 5, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.
