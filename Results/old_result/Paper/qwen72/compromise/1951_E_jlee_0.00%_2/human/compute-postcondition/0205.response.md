Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` > 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if `count` > 1, otherwise `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. Additionally, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. If `count` > 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
