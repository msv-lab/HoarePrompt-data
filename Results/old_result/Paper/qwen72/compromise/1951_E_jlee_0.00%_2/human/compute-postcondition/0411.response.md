Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 2.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `string` is a new input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
5. `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
6. `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
7. `j` is 2.
8. `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
9. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`j` is 2**: This is explicitly given in the initial state.
2. **`string[:j - 1]`**: This will print the substring of `string` from the start up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` will print the first character of `string`.
3. **`string[j - 1:]`**: This will print the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` will print the string starting from the second character to the end.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello", the output will be:
Output: **h ello**
