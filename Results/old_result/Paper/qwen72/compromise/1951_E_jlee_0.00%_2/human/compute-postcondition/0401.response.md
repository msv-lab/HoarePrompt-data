Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `done` is True. Otherwise, the program continues with `done` remaining False.***
