Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `count` is a non-negative integer, `count2` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 1 or if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `n` is odd and the character at the middle index of `s` is not equal to `x`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
