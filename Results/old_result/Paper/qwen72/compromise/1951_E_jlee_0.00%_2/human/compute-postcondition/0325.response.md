Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False. Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count` is less than 1.**
