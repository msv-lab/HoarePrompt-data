Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is not equal to `x` before the loop breaks, `count2` is the number of positions where `s[j]` is equal to `x` before the loop breaks, and `done` is False.**
