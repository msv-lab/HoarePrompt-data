The given `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The precondition provides information about various variables and objects (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `done`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
