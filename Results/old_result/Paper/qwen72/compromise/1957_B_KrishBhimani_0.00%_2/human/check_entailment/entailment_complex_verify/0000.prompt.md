You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of indices where the binary representation of `k0` has 1s, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The remaining elements (if any) are zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`, up to `n-1` elements. If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are set to 0. If the number of 1s is exactly `n-1`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. The function prints the list `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is a power of 2 and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the program will not correctly distribute the sum `k` among `n` numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 8
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 8`. The correct output should be a sequence of 3 numbers that sum to 8 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. One possible correct output is:
```
8 0 0
```
However, the given program will output:
```
8 0 0
```
This output is correct, but the program does not handle other cases where `k` is a power of 2 and `n` is greater than 1 in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. For instance, for the input:
```
1
4 16
```
The program will output:
```
16 0 0 0
```
This output is correct, but it does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. A correct output could be:
```
8 4 2 2
```
This sequence sums to 16 and has a bitwise OR of `15` (binary `1111`), which has 4 ones, the maximum possible. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
