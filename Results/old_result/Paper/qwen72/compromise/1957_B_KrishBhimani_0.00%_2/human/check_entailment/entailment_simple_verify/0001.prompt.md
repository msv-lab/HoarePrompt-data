You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of indices where the binary representation of `k0` has 1s, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The remaining elements (if any) are zeros.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and converts them to integers using `map(int, l1)`.

2. **Binary Representation Analysis:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It iterates through the bits of `k` using a while loop and checks if the current bit is set to 1 using `k & 1 == 1`.
   - If the current bit is set to 1, it appends the bit position `i` to `arr`.
   - It then right shifts `k` by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`) and increments `i` by 1.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.
   - It iterates through the bit positions stored in `arr` and constructs the sequence by setting the corresponding bit in the integers.
   - If `c` reaches `n-1`, it appends the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - If the sequence is not yet of length `n`, it appends zeros to `ans` to make it of length `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
- By setting the bits that are set in `k` to 1 in the sequence, the program ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s.
- The remaining value is added to the last element to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
- If `n` is greater than the number of bits set in `k`, the program appends zeros to the sequence to meet the length requirement.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Sequence (n = 1):** The program correctly outputs `k` as the single element.
- **Sum of Sequence (k):** The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adjusting the last element.
- **Bitwise OR Maximization:** The program correctly sets the bits to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, and ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Correctness:
**True**
