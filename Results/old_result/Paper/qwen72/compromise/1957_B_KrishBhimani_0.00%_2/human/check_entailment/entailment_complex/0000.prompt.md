Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of indices where the binary representation of `k0` has 1s, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The remaining elements (if any) are zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`, up to `n-1` elements. If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are set to 0. If the number of 1s is exactly `n-1`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. The function prints the list `ans` for each test case.
