Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- `i` is the last element in `arr`.
- `arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `c` is the number of iterations.
- `ans` is a list containing the values \(1 << i\) for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop to Populate `ans`**:
   - The loop runs until `c` reaches `n - 1`.
   - For each `i` in `arr`, the value \(1 << i\) (which is \(2^i\)) is appended to `ans`.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`.
   - `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume the following values for the initial state:
- `l1 = ['5', '10']` (so `n = 5` and `k0 = 10`).
- `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Execution:
1. **Initialize `ans`**:
   - `ans = []`.

2. **Loop to Populate `ans`**:
   - `i = 0`, `ans.append(1 << 0)`, so `ans = [1]`.
   - `i = 1`, `ans.append(1 << 1)`, so `ans = [1, 2]`.
   - `i = 2`, `ans.append(1 << 2)`, so `ans = [1, 2, 4]`.
   - `i = 3`, `ans.append(1 << 3)`, so `ans = [1, 2, 4, 8]`.
   - `i = 4`, `ans.append(1 << 4)`, so `ans = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - `c` has reached `n - 1` (which is 4), so we append `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - `sum(ans) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31`.
   - `k0 - sum(ans) = 10 - 31 = -21`.
   - `ans = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, -21]`.

4. **Extend `ans` with Zeros**:
   - `ans` is already of length 6, which is greater than `n` (5), so no zeros are added.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 -21**
