Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = []` reassigns `arr` to an empty list.
- Since `arr` is now empty, `i` (which was the last element in `arr`) is no longer defined.
- The list `ans` is initially populated with values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1` or the loop breaks. Since `arr` is now empty, `ans` will be a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`) remain unchanged.
