The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is 0
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `i` is the first element in `arr`
- `arr` must have at least one element
- `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, and `c` is 1. If `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` contains the values `k0` and `1 << i`, and `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be the second element in `arr`
- `arr` must have at least two elements

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, and `c` is 1. If `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` contains the values `k0` and `1 << i`, and `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
