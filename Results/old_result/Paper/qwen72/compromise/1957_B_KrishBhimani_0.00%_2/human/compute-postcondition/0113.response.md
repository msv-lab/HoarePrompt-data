Output State: **`arr` is an empty list if `k` is even, or `arr` contains `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` shifted right by 1 bit and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 2, `c` is the number of iterations, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the value `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`. Additionally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`.
- If `k` is even, `arr` was initially an empty list, so after appending `i`, `arr` remains an empty list.
- If `k` is odd, `arr` initially contained `[1]`, so after appending `i`, `arr` now contains `[1, 2]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
