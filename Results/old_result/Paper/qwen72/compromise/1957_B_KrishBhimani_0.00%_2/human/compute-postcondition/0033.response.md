Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` contains the value `1 << i` and the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, `c` is increased by 1. If `c` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` retains its new value.**

Explanation:
- `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `ans` before this line is `[1 << i]`, so `sum(ans)` is `1 << i`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `k0 - (1 << i)`.
- `c` is increased by 1, so its new value is `c + 1`.
- The conditions for `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- If `c` equals `n - 1` after the increment, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` retains its new value.
