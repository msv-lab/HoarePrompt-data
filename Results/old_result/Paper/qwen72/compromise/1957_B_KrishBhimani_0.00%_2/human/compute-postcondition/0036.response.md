Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` contains the value `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 and `ans` retains the value `1 << i`. `c` is increased by 1.**
