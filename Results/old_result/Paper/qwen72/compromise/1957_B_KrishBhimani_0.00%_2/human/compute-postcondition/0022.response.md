Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, and `arr` is a list containing the positions of all the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from the least significant bit (0-based index).**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The value of `_` remains 0.
- The list `l1` remains unchanged, containing the strings from the input.
- The value of `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The value of `k` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The value of `k0` remains the integer value of the second element in `l1`, which was the initial value of `k`.
- The value of `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`.
- The list `arr` contains the positions of all the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from the least significant bit (0-based index). For example, if `k0` is 13 (binary 1101), `arr` will be [0, 2, 3].
