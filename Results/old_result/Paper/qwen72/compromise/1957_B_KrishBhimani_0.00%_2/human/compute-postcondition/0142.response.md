Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is a list of indices where the binary representation of `k0` has 1s, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The remaining elements (if any) are zeros.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases, which remains within the range 1 to 10,000.
- **`_`**: The loop counter, which will be `t - 1` after all iterations have completed.
- **`l1`**: A list of strings obtained from the input for the current test case.
- **`n`**: The integer value of the first element in `l1`, representing the length of the output list `ans`.
- **`k`**: This variable is reset to 0 for each test case after the inner loop completes.
- **`k0`**: The integer value of the second element in `l1`, representing the initial value of `k` for the current test case.
- **`i`**: The last index in the `arr` list, which is derived from the binary representation of `k0`.
- **`arr`**: A list of indices where the binary representation of `k0` has 1s. This list is generated during the inner loop.
- **`ans`**: A list of length `n` that contains the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to `n-1` elements. If the number of elements in `arr` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are zeros. If the number of elements in `arr` is exactly `n - 1`, an additional element `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])` is appended to `ans` to ensure the sum of `ans` equals `k0`.

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all `t` test cases.
