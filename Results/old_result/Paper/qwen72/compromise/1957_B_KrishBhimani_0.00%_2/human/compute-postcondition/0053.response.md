The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and `k` must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros**
