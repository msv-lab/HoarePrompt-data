Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the initial values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1` or the loop breaks, and the remaining elements are zeros.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to `l1`.
- The initial state already specifies that `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, so this part remains unchanged.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state, since the code snippet only affects `l1`.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the only change being the confirmation that `l1` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.
