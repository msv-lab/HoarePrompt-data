The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` contains the value `1 << i`, `c` is increased by 1. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` contains the value `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `1 << i` and `c` retains its new value.**
