Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (using integer division) and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the elements [0, 1].**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`.
- If `k0` is an odd number, `arr` initially contains the element 0. After appending `i` (which is 1), `arr` now contains [0, 1].
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
