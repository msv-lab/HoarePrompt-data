Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is a list containing the positions of all the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from the least significant bit (0-based index), `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.**

The variable `c` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.
