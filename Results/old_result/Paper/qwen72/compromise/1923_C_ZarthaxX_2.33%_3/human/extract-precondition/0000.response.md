Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
