### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in the array `nums`.

3. **Cumulative Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array by adding 1 for each element in `nums` that is equal to 1.
   - The `sum` array is updated by adding `nums[i] - 1` for each element in `nums`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray is a single element (`l == r`). If so, it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be changed to a different positive integer.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds.
   - This condition is derived from the requirement that the sum of the elements in the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` should be equal to the sum of the elements in the array `b` (where `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i` for all `i`).
   - The term `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the minimum sum increase needed if all 1s are changed to 2s.
   - The term `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the number of elements that are not 1, which can be changed to any positive integer greater than 1.
   - The sum of these changes should be less than or equal to the adjusted sum `sumInRange`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The use of cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum` ensures efficient query handling, and the condition check is logically sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
