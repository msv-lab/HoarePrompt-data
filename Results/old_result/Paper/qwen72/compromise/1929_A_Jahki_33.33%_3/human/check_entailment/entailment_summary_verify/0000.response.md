### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
   - For an array to have maximum beauty, it should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array is already in strictly increasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints 0.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Evaluating `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is in strictly increasing order.
   - However, the function is not correctly implemented. It increments `order` whenever it finds an element that is not strictly less than the next element, but it does not handle the case where all elements are the same correctly.
   - The function should return `True` if the array is in strictly increasing order, but it will also return `True` if the array is in non-decreasing order (which includes the case where all elements are the same).

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where all elements are the same correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct condition for determining if the beauty should be 0.
   - The suggested correction is to check if all elements are the same using `len(set(a)) == 1`.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program will correctly print 0 for arrays where all elements are the same, but this is coincidental and not due to the intended logic.
   - For arrays where not all elements are the same, the program will sort the array and calculate the beauty correctly.
   - However, the logic for checking if all elements are the same is flawed, and the program will incorrectly print 0 for arrays that are in non-decreasing order but not strictly increasing.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. The function `func_1` is not the appropriate way to check for this condition.

Final: **False**
