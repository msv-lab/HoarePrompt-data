### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num`), and for each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).
   - The array `a` is correctly parsed from the input string into a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element (`order`).
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints 0, which is correct because the beauty of a sorted array in non-decreasing order is 0.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty of the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The maximum beauty of an array is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the array is sorted.
   - The program correctly identifies when the array is already sorted and prints 0.
   - For unsorted arrays, the program sorts them and calculates the beauty, which is the correct approach.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), correctly printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, correctly printing 0.
   - For other cases, it correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or all elements are the same.
