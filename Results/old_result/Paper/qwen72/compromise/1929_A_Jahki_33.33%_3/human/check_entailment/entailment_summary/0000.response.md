### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - To maximize this sum, we should sort the array in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these minimized differences will be maximized.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.
   - It then checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order using the function `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in strictly increasing order, the program prints `0` (which is incorrect, as the beauty should be calculated even if the array is already sorted).
   - If the array is not in strictly increasing order, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is in strictly increasing order.
   - If the array is already in strictly increasing order, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Correctness Issues:**
   - The program incorrectly prints `0` when the array is already in strictly increasing order. This is a mistake because the beauty should still be calculated and printed, even if the array is already sorted.
   - The correct approach should be to always sort the array and calculate the beauty, regardless of whether the array is initially sorted or not.

5. **Corrected Approach:**
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty using the sorted array.
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not always calculate the beauty of the array correctly. It fails to calculate the beauty when the array is already in strictly increasing order.

### Correctness:
**False**
