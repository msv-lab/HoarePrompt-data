Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` is set to 1. Otherwise, `order` remains 0.***
