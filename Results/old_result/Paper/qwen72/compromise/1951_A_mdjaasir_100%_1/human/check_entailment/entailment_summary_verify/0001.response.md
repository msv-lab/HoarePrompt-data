### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func()` is defined to solve a problem involving input strings and counting occurrences of the character '1'. This matches the problem description and the function summary.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (which is not used in the logic) and a string `a`. This is consistent with the problem description and the function summary.

3. **Counting '1's**:
   - It counts the number of '1's in the string `a` using `a.count('1')`. This is a valid and efficient way to count occurrences of a character in a string.

4. **Condition Checks**:
   - If the count of '1's is `0`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct based on the problem description.
   - If the count of '1's is greater than `2` and the count is even, it prints 'YES'. This is also correct.
   - If the count of '1's is exactly `2`, it checks if the two '1's are adjacent. If they are not adjacent, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This is implemented correctly by checking the position of the first '1' and the character immediately following it.
   - For all other cases, it prints 'NO'. This is the correct fallback condition.

5. **Logical Flow**:
   - The function correctly handles the different conditions based on the count of '1's.
   - The adjacency check for exactly two '1's is correctly implemented by checking the position of the first '1' and the character immediately following it.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The function reads input from `input()` and prints the result to the console, which is consistent with typical problem-solving in competitive programming or similar contexts.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the count of '1's is `0` or when there are exactly two '1's that are not adjacent. It also correctly handles cases where the count of '1's is odd or greater than 2 but not even.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is logically correct and handles all the specified conditions as described in the problem. There are no apparent issues with the code.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem and function summary.
