Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. Each element in the list is initially set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element, which is adjusted to be `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k` after the loop. The final state of the program is a list `nums` where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` zeros. **
