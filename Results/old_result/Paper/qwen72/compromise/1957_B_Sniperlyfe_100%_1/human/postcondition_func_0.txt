The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). The remaining elements of the list are set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the first element, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function.
