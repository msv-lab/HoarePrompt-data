### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first element has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - It then subtracts `nums[0]` from `k` to update the remaining sum.
   - For the remaining elements in the list, it iterates from index 1 to `n-1` and sets each element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`. This ensures that the remaining elements are as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
   - After setting the elements, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the first element `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum is exactly `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the generated sequence to the `results` list and prints each sequence on a new line.

### Analysis of the Function:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the elements in `nums` is initially set to `nums[0]` and then the remaining elements are added to it. The function ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` is exactly `k` by adjusting the first element if necessary.

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - The remaining elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, which ensures that the remaining elements contribute to the sum without exceeding `k`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Element (`n = 1`):**
  - If `n = 1`, the function correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k`, which satisfies both conditions.

- **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):**
  - The function ensures that the first element has the maximum number of 1s, and the remaining elements are as large as possible without exceeding `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The function handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
