Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `same_value_count` will hold the count of how many times the `favorite_value` (which is the value at index `f - 1` in the list `a`) appears in the entire list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
