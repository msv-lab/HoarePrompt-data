Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least three elements, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, `value` is the third element in the list `a`. If `value` > `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.***
