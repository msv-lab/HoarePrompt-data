Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the input and remain unchanged, `favorite_value` is the value of the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, this condition still holds. If `greater_count` is less than `k`, then `greater_count + same_value_count` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`. `same_value_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element. `value` is the first element of `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least two elements, `value` is the second element of `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least three elements. `value` is the third element of `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
