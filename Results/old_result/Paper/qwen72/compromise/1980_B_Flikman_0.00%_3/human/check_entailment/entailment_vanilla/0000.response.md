### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Dmitry has `n` cubes, each showing a value `a_i`.
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
   - The first `k` cubes are removed.
   - We need to determine if the favorite cube (index `f`) will be removed in all cases, in no cases, or in some cases.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The favorite cube's value is `a[f-1]`.
   - If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will definitely be removed.
   - If there are fewer than `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value, and the total number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube plus the number of cubes with greater values is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, depending on the order of cubes with the same value.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and the list of values `a`.
   - It determines the value of the favorite cube `favorite_value`.
   - It counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube `same_value_count`.
   - It counts the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value `greater_count`.
   - It then checks:
     - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" (the favorite cube will be removed).
     - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints "NO" (the favorite cube will not be removed).
     - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" (the favorite cube may or may not be removed).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic for counting `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is correct.
   - The conditions for determining "YES", "NO", and "MAYBE" are also correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
