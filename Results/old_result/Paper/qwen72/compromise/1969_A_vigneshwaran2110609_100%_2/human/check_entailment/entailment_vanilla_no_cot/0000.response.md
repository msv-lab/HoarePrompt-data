Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's why:

1. **Logic for Detecting Pairs**: The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to determine if a pair of friends (i and p_i) are each other's best friends. This is a valid check for detecting such pairs, but the program only prints `2` if it finds such a pair and immediately breaks out of the loop. This means it will not correctly handle cases where there are no such pairs but the minimum number of invitations required is still `2`.

2. **Output for No Pairs**: If no such pairs are found, the program prints `3`. This is not always correct. For example, in the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the minimum number of invitations required is `3`, but in other cases, it might be `2` even if no direct pairs are found.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a set to track visited friends
        visited = set()
        
        # Initialize the minimum number of invitations
        min_invitations = 0
        
        for i in range(x):
            if i + 1 not in visited:
                # Start a new chain
                current = i + 1
                while current not in visited:
                    visited.add(current)
                    current = l[current - 1]
                min_invitations += 1
        
        # Ensure at least 2 friends come to the party
        if min_invitations < 2:
            min_invitations = 2
        
        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Tracking Visited Friends**: We use a set `visited` to keep track of friends who have already been considered in a chain.
- **Finding Chains**: We iterate through each friend and follow the chain of best friends until we encounter a friend who has already been visited. Each new chain we start increases the count of `min_invitations`.
- **Ensuring at Least 2 Friends**: After processing all friends, we ensure that `min_invitations` is at least `2` to meet the requirement of having at least 2 friends at the party.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
