Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `n` is at least 2, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
