Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than `x`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is not set (or remains `False` if it was initially `False`). The element at the index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1).**
