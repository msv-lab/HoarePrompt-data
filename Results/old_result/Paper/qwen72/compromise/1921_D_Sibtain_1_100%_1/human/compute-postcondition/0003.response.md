Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a` and `c` as input. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reverse-sorted list `c`. If both `a` and `c` contain only one unique value, it prints 0. If `a` contains only one element, it prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the maximum or minimum element of `c`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. The initial variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, but the function processes all test cases provided. **
