Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last one, is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.** 

Here, `k` is the result of the initial `k` minus `n` times the value of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The list `nums` is constructed based on the modified value of `k` for the last element.
