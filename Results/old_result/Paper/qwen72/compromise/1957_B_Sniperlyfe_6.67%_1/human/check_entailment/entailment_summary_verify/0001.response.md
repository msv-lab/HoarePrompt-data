### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over the list and sets each element to the largest possible number with the highest bit set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Specifically, it sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
   - After setting each element, it subtracts the value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - **Sum of Elements:**
     - The loop sets each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - This value is subtracted from `k` in each iteration.
     - After `n-1` iterations, the remaining value of `k` is added to the last element.
     - Therefore, the sum of the elements in `nums` is indeed `k`.

   - **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
     - The bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k` if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
     - This is because the loop sets each element to the same value with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, and the bitwise OR of these values will have all those bits set to 1.
     - If `k` is not large enough to set all bits to 1 for `n` elements, the remaining value is added to the last element, ensuring that the highest possible bits are set to 1.
     - However, the function `func_1` sets each element to the same value, which might not be the optimal way to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 2, the function will set both elements to 3 (binary `11`), and the remaining 2 will be added to the last element, resulting in `[3, 2]` (binary `11` and `10`), which has a bitwise OR of `11` (binary `11`), but the optimal solution would be `[1, 4]` (binary `01` and `100`), which has a bitwise OR of `101` (binary `101`), maximizing the number of 1s.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n = 1`):**
     - If `n = 1`, the function will set the single element to `k`, which is correct.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):**
     - If `n > 1`, the function will set each element to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, and the remaining value will be added to the last element.
     - This ensures that the sum is `k`, but it does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, but it does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements. The function `func_1` sets each element to the same value, which can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.
