Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `b == c`, it prints "YES" because Nikita can achieve exactly `m` cubes by making `n` moves where each move is adding a cube.
   - If `b < c`, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes" because if the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No" because the parity of `b` and `c` is different, and it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes with `n` moves.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

The logic and conditions in the program correctly handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
