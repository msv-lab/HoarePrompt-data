### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled as per the problem description.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent `n` and `m` respectively. This is also correctly handled.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve exactly `c` cubes. This is correct.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If `b` is less than `c`, it is impossible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be even, which is only possible if `b` and `c` have the same parity. This is correct.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If `b` and `c` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be odd, which is not possible if `b` and `c` have different parities. This is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "YES" (or "Yes") if the conditions are met, and "NO" (or "No") otherwise. The problem description allows for case-insensitive outputs, so "YES" and "Yes" are both valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the conditions, and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
