### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube per move. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition checks if both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). If they do, it is possible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs and then add one more cube to end up with `c` cubes.
     - This condition is correct.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If the parities of `b` and `c` are different, it is impossible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa, the number of moves cannot result in the desired number of cubes.
     - This condition is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description. The output is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" are acceptable.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 100\).
- **Inside the loop**:
  - `a` is the number of test cases.
  - `b` and `c` are the integers read for each test case.
  - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, but it is not used in the logic and can be ignored.
  - The conditions are checked as follows:
    - If `b == c`, it prints "YES".
    - If `b < c`, it prints "NO".
    - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes".
    - Otherwise, it prints "No".
- **State after the loop**:
  - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\).
  - `a` is the input integer representing the number of test cases.
  - The loop has executed `a` times, and for each iteration, it has printed the correct output based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
