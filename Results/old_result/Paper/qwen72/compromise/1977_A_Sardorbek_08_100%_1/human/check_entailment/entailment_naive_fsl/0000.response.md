Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (number of cubes), if `b` is less than `c`, and if `b % 2 == c % 2`. However, it should only check if the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c` is the same, because the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must have the same parity for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem, it is possible to end up with 2 cubes after 4 moves (put 1 cube, put 1 cube, remove 1 cube, put 1 cube). However, the program will output "No" because it checks `b < c` and `b % 2 == c % 2` separately, which is incorrect. The correct logic should only check if `b % 2 == c % 2`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
This version correctly checks the parity of `b` and `c` and will output the correct result for all potential cases.
