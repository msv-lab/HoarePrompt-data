Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. It then checks the following conditions for each test case: if `b` is equal to `c`, it prints 'YES'; if `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'; if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `b`, `c`, and `q` are not retained. The function does not modify any external state or variables outside its scope. **
