Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
2. `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer at index `i` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`.
3. `t` is 1.
4. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
5. `s` is a list of integers provided by the user.
6. `r` is the string containing the characters at the indices in `a` corresponding to the values in `s`.
7. `i` is the last integer in `s`.
8. `x` is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String `a`**: This is a fixed string containing all lowercase English letters in order.
   - `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`

2. **List `b`**: This list is dynamically generated based on the list `s`. Each element at index `i` in `b` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`.
   - For example, if `s = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, then:
     - `b[0]` will be incremented by 3 (since 0 appears 3 times in `s`).
     - `b[1]` will be incremented by 1 (since 1 appears 1 time in `s`).
     - `b[2]` will be incremented by 1 (since 2 appears 1 time in `s`).
     - `b[3]` will be incremented by 1 (since 3 appears 1 time in `s`).
     - All other elements in `b` will remain 0.

3. **List `s`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.
   - For example, `s` could be `[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0]`.

4. **String `r`**: This string is constructed by taking the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the values in `s`.
   - For example, if `s = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, then:
     - `r` will be `'aabcad'` (since `a[0] = 'a'`, `a[1] = 'b'`, `a[2] = 'c'`, `a[0] = 'a'`, `a[3] = 'd'`, `a[0] = 'a'`).

5. **Integer `i`**: This is the last integer in the list `s`.
   - For example, if `s = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, then `i = 0`.

6. **Integer `x`**: This is the index of the last occurrence of `i` in the list `b`.
   - For example, if `s = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0]` and `b` is `[3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, then `x = 0` (since the last occurrence of 0 in `b` is at index 0).

### Final Output:
The `print(r)` statement will print the string `r`, which is constructed by taking the characters from `a` at the indices specified by the values in `s`.

Since the exact values of `s` are not provided, we can't determine the exact string `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string `r`.

Output: **r (where r is the string constructed by taking the characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' at the indices specified by the values in the list s)**
