The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is used as the loop variable, so it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
