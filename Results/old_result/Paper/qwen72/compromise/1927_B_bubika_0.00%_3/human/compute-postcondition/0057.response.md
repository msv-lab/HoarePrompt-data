The function `func` is described with parameters but the function signature in the provided code snippet does not include these parameters. Assuming the parameters are `t`, `n`, and `a`, based on the given constraints and relationships:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, representing the trace of a permutation.

The function returns a valid string `s` that corresponds to the given trace for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, ensuring the function can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers representing a trace. For each test case, the function returns a valid string `s` that corresponds to the given trace.**
