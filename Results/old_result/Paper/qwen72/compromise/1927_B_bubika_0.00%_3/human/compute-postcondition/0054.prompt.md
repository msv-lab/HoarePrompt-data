Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is an empty string, `b` is a list where each element corresponding to the integers in the previous `s` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer in the previous `s`, `t` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than the updated `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the first integer in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is increased by the value of `a[x]`, `b[x]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second integer in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is now `r + a[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty list of integers provided by the user with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third integer in `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `r` is now `r + a[x]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
