Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `n` integers, `r` is an empty string, and a `NameError` is raised because `b` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers, `r` is a string that has been concatenated with the values of `a[x]` for each integer `i` in `s`, where `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. Each element in `b` corresponding to the integers in `s` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string that has been concatenated with the values of `a[x]` for each integer `i` in `s`, where `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. Each element in `b` that corresponds to an integer in `s` has been incremented by the number of times that integer appears in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
