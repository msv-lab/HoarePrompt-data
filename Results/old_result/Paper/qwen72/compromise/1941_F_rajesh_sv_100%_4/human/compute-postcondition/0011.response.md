To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F`.
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged.

2. **Variables:**
   - `ans`: This is the result of a computation that finds the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between two expressions for each `f` in `F`.
   - `max_diff`: This is a variable that remains unchanged and represents some maximum difference.
   - `next_max_diff`: This is another variable that remains unchanged and represents some other maximum difference.

3. **Expression in the `print` statement:**
   - `max(ans, next_max_diff)`: This will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - `ans` is the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F`. This means `ans` is a computed value that is the smallest among all the maximum differences for each `f` in `F`.
   - `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are predefined values that are not changed by the computation of `ans`.
   - The `print` statement will output the larger of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Since the exact values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The output will be the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for each f in F, and next_max_diff is a predefined value)**
