Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates a value `k` based on these inputs and prints it. The value of `k` is determined by the following rules: if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it adds `a` to the quotient of `(b + c) // 3` and, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, increments `k` by 1 before printing it. After processing all test cases, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last values read from the input for the last test case. **
