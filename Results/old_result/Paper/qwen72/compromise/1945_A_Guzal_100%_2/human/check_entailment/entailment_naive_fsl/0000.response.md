Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts `b` is such that it cannot be fully accommodated with the available universals `c` to form tents of exactly 3 people. Specifically, the condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is not sufficient to ensure that all extroverts can be accommodated.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 4 1
```
Here, `a = 1`, `b = 4`, and `c = 1`. The program will output `-1` because `b % 3 = 1` and `b % 3 + c = 2`, which is less than 3. However, this case can actually be accommodated as follows:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 3 people: 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- 1 tent for the remaining extrovert.

Thus, the correct output should be `3`, not `-1`. The program fails to handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
