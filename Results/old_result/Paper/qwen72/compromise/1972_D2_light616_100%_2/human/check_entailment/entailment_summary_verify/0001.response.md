### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
     - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) where \(x \cdot x \le n\).
     - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) where \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\), it increments the counter by the minimum of the number of valid multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).
     - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - This ensures that the solution is applied to multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_2` reads a positive integer \(t\) and calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times. It does not return any value.

4. **Correctness and Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - The logic inside `func_1` ensures that the gcd condition is checked and the valid pairs are counted.
   - The use of `math.gcd` and the conditions inside the loops ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The use of `math.gcd` and the conditions inside the loops ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
