### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve one test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are potential values for \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - The loop conditions ensure that \(x\) and \(y\) are within the bounds defined by \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the gcd to be 1.
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the number of valid multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - The logic correctly checks for the gcd condition and counts the valid pairs.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The use of `math.gcd` and the conditions inside the loops ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The initial state before `func_1` is called is accurately described.
   - The state after the loops and before printing `cnt` is also correctly described.
   - The final state after calling `func_1` multiple times in `func_2` is accurately described.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
