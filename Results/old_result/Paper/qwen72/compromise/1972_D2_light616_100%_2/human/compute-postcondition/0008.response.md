The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraint, it is implied that there might be an internal use of a variable `t` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since no specific output is provided, we cannot definitively state what the function returns. However, typically such a function might perform some operation using `t` and return a result based on that operation.

Given the lack of specific output details, the most accurate description of the functionality would be:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but internally uses a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). The exact return value is not specified, but it likely performs some operation involving `t` and returns a result based on that operation.**
