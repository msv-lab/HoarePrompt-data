Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 5, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). Additionally, `n` must be at least 25.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated from its initial condition (the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\)) to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
