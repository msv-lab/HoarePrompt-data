The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The gcd condition (`cnt` is 1 if gcd of `x` and `y` is 1) is still valid because the gcd of 3 and 3 is not 1, so `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
