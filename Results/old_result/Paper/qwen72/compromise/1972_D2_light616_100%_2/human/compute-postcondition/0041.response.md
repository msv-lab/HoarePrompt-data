Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is initially the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
- `n` must be at least 30.
- The GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.

The code snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x + y`:**
   - `x` is 5.
   - `y` is 1.
   - Therefore, `x + y` is 6.

2. **Calculate \((x + y) * x\) and \((x + y) * y\):**
   - \((x + y) * x = 6 * 5 = 30\)
   - \((x + y) * y = 6 * 1 = 6\)

3. **Check the conditions:**
   - \((x + y) * x = 30\) should be less than or equal to `n`.
   - \((x + y) * y = 6\) should be less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Calculate `min(n // 30, m // 6)`:**
   - `n // 30` gives the integer division of `n` by 30.
   - `m // 6` gives the integer division of `m` by 6.
   - `min(n // 30, m // 6)` gives the minimum of these two values.

5. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is incremented by the value of `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.

### Output State Calculation:
- `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `x` remains 5.
- `y` remains 1.
- `cnt` is updated by adding `min(n // 30, m // 6)` to its current value.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 5, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the original value of `cnt` plus `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.**
