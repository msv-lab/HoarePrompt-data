Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- Initially, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0.
- After the code execution, `last_row` now includes the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 and the last character of the string in `a` at index 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.
