Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing the initial input string, the new input string, and another new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string and the first character of the last input string, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string, `i` is `n + 1`, but the loop will not execute because `i` is no longer less than `n`.**
