Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last (and only) string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`.
- Since `a` contains only one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that string.
- `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string.
- `first_row` was initially an empty string, so after the code execution, it contains the first character of the string in `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `last_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
