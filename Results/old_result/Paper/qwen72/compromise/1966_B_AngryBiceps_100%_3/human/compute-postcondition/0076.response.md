Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The length of the set of `first_row` is 1, meaning all characters in `first_row` are the same.
- The length of the set of `last_row` is 1, meaning all characters in `last_row` are the same.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The statement will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.

Output: **NO**
