Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a`, `i` is 0**

The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Since `a` contains one input string, `a[-1]` refers to this string, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of this string. The initial value of `last_row` is an empty string, so after the code execution, `last_row` is now the last character of the input string. All other variables remain unchanged.
