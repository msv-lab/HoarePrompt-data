You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' representing white and black squares, respectively. The grid is defined by its dimensions n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The total number of test cases `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers for each test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for each test case, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, and `i` is `n-1` for each test case. For each test case, if the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, or if `first_row` and `last_row` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' with dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500). It processes each test case and returns the result for each grid. The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
