Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first row and the last row each consist of a single distinct character and the first row is different from the last row, then this condition is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the last string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`, or the first row has more than one distinct character, or the last row has more than one distinct character, or the first row is the same as the last row.***
