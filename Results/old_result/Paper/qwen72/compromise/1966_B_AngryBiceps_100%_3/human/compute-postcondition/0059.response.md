To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The state of `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `t`, and `m` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer
- `a` is an empty list
- `first_row` is an empty string
- `last_row` is an empty string
- `i` is `n-1`

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is set to `n-1`, but this is not a requirement for the loop to start; the loop will iterate from 0 to `n-1` regardless of the initial value of `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `n` must be greater than 0

The state of `i` is not necessary to adjust because the loop will set `i` to 0 on its first iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`**
