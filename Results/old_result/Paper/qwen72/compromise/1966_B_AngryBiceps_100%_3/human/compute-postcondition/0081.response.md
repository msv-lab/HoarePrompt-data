Output State: **The total number of test cases `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers for each test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for each test case, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, and `i` is `n-1` for each test case. For each test case, if the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, or if `first_row` and `last_row` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all the iterations, the following conditions hold true for each test case:
- The number of test cases `t` is greater than 0.
- For each test case, the dimensions `n` and `m` are input integers.
- The list `a` contains `n` input strings for each test case.
- The string `first_row` is composed of the first characters of each string in `a` for each test case.
- The string `last_row` is composed of the last characters of each string in `a` for each test case.
- The variable `i` is `n-1` for each test case.
- For each test case, if the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, or if `first_row` and `last_row` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.
