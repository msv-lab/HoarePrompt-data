#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), where both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list 'arr' sorted in non-increasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns the list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order. The original lists `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations are not affected by this function.
