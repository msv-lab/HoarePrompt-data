Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, and the two lists `a` and `b` which are already sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `cnt` (the count of new problems needed) to 0, and two indices `i` and `j` to 0. This is correct as it will be used to track the positions in the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Comparison and Insertion**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the lists `a` and `b` until either list is fully processed.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `b[j] < a[i]`. If this condition is true, it means the current difficulty in `b` is less than the current difficulty in `a`, and a new problem needs to be proposed.
   - The program then removes the last element from `a` (which is the most difficult problem) and inserts `b[j]` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
   - The count `cnt` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b`.

4. **Correct Position Insertion**:
   - The insertion is done using `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]`, which ensures that the new element is inserted at the correct position to maintain the sorted order.
   - This is a correct approach, but it can be optimized. However, for the given constraints (n ≤ 100), this approach is efficient enough.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the count of new problems needed for each test case.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts a list in non-increasing order, which is not necessary for the problem. This function can be ignored as it does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order by simply moving through the lists without proposing new problems.
   - It also handles the case where multiple elements in `a` need to be adjusted by repeatedly proposing new problems and maintaining the sorted order.

8. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n^2) due to the repeated insertion and deletion operations. However, for the given constraints (n ≤ 100), this complexity is acceptable.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
