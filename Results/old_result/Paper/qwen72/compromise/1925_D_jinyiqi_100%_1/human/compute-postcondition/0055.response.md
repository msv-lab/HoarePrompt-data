Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m`, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is `sum_f + total_f`, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 2**: This condition remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- **`i` is 2**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`n` is `new_n`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`m` is `new_m`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`k` is `new_k`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same.
- **`sum_f` is `sum_f + total_f`**: The variable `sum_f` accumulates the sum of all `f` values read from the input over all iterations of the loop. `total_f` represents the sum of all `f` values read during the loop.
- **`j` is `m-1`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, which is the last index of the loop.
- **`a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration**: These variables hold the values of the last set of inputs read during the final iteration of the loop.
- **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`**: This value is calculated based on `n` and does not change within the loop.
- **`p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`**: This value is recalculated after the loop completes, using the updated `sum_f` and the original values of `m`, `k`, and `cn2`.
- **`q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`**: This value is recalculated after the loop completes, using the original values of `n` and `gcd`.
- **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**: This value is recalculated after the loop completes, using the updated values of `p` and `q`.
