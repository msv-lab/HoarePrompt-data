The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the user's input, while the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.**
