Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` are input integers, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, `f` are input integers.**

The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial state remains unchanged for the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`). The new values for `a`, `b`, and `f` are taken from the user input, which are integers.
