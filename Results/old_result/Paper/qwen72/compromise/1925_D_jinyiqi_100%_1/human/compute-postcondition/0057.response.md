Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m`, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is `sum_f + total_f`, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the input integers read from the input during the last iteration, `cn2` is `new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * new_k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + new_m * new_k * (new_k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (new_n * (new_n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `2 * new_k * cn2 * (sum_f + total_f) + new_m * new_k * (new_k - 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
