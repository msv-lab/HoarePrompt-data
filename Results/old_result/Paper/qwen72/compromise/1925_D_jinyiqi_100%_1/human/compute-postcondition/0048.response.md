Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `m` is `new_m` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `new_k`, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the new input integers read from the input during this iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum_f` is updated by adding the value of `f` to it.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
