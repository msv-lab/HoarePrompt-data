The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer not present in `arr` or the smallest integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is greater than any previously seen integer that also appears exactly once. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program has processed `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
