Reasoning:

The program provided is attempting to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob construct during their game. However, the program does not simulate the actual game play; instead, it directly computes the MEX of the array `a` after considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The logic is based on the idea that Alice and Bob will play optimally, and the final MEX of `c` can be determined by the distribution of numbers in `a`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.

2. **Counting Elements**: For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself. It then uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Determining MEX**: The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in the keys of `mpp` (the counter). This is the basic MEX calculation. However, the program also includes an additional check to handle the game dynamics:
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, as `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This condition is intended to handle the scenario where Alice and Bob are playing optimally, and `i` is the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `a` after Alice has picked an element that appears exactly once.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, it sets `first` to `True`. This is to track that Alice has picked an element that appears exactly once, which affects Bob's subsequent moves.

The program's logic is based on the assumption that:
- Alice will always pick an element that appears exactly once in `a` if it exists, to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will pick an element that appears exactly once in `a` if it exists and `first` is `True`, to minimize the MEX.

However, the program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the optimal strategy inferred from the distribution of elements in `a`.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal play assumption, the program's logic is correct. The MEX calculation and the handling of elements that appear exactly once are consistent with the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
