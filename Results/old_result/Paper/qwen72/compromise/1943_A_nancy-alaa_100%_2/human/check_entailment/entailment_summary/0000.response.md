Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, have played optimally. The key to this problem is understanding the optimal strategies for both players:

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the score, which means she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c` to delay the appearance of the smallest missing integer.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the score, which means he should try to remove the smallest integers from `a` to force Alice to pick larger integers or to prevent Alice from completing a sequence of small integers.

Given these strategies, the optimal approach is to focus on the smallest integers that are either missing from the array or appear exactly once. Here's how the provided program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Elements**: For each test case, it uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `arr`.
3. **Finding MEX**: It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `arr`. If such an integer is found, it is printed as the MEX.
4. **Handling Single Occurrences**: If all integers from 0 to `n` are present in the array, it checks if there is a smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once. If such an integer is found, it is printed as the MEX.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the program:

- The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `arr` and prints it as the MEX.
- The program also correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that appears exactly once and is greater than any previously seen integer that also appears exactly once. However, this part of the logic is not necessary for the optimal solution.

The optimal strategy for both players is to focus on the smallest integers that are either missing or appear exactly once. If a smallest integer is missing, Alice will ensure it is not included in `c`, and Bob will try to remove it from `a`. If all integers are present, the smallest integer that appears exactly once will be the MEX because Alice will pick it to maximize the score, and Bob will not be able to prevent it.

The provided program correctly identifies the MEX in both scenarios, but the logic for handling single occurrences is overly complex and not strictly necessary. The correct approach is to simply find the smallest integer that is either missing or appears exactly once.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in its output, but the logic can be simplified. However, since the program produces the correct output for the given problem, we can consider it correct.

Correctness: **True**
