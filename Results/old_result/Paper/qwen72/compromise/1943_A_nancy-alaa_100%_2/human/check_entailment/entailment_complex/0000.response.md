Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Array and Counter Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `arr`. It then uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This is a good approach to efficiently track the frequency of each element.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The function iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the MEX. The logic is as follows:
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in `arr`, and the function prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This condition is intended to handle the case where `i` is the smallest integer that appears exactly once and is greater than any previously seen integer that also appears exactly once. However, this condition is not necessary for the optimal strategy.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, it sets `first` to `True`. This is intended to track the first occurrence of an integer that appears exactly once.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is to ensure that the smallest integer that appears exactly once is included in `c` if possible. However, the current logic in the function does not fully capture this strategy. Specifically, the condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not required and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to simply find the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once.

5. **Simplified MEX Calculation**: The correct logic should be:
   - Iterate through the range from 0 to `n` and find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr`.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n` are present in `arr`, the MEX is `n`.

Given these points, the current implementation is not fully correct because it includes an unnecessary condition that can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
```

This version correctly finds the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
