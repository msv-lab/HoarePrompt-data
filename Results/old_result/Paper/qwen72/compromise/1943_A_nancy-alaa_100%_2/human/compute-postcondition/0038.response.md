Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is either True or False depending on whether a unique integer was found in `arr` before the loop ended. The loop will execute again if the new `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `arr` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `first`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged.
- The state of the loop and the condition for `first` remain the same as in the initial state.
