Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be non-negative.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is True.
   - `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary.
   - The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary.
   - The `mpp` dictionary is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1, which means the integer `i` appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the integer `i`, which is a key in the `mpp` dictionary and appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
