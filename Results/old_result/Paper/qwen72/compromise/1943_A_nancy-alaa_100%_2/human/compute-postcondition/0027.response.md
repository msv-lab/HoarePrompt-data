Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop (though it is not used in the given code snippet).
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` is False.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the value of `i` is explicitly given as 2, the `print` statement will output the integer 2.

Output: **2**
