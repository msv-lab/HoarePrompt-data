Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0, but its exact value is not needed for the `print(i)` statement.
- `first` is set to False, but it is not used in the `print(i)` statement.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input, but its exact values are not needed for the `print(i)` statement.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, but it is not used in the `print(i)` statement.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly set to 1.

Output: **1**
