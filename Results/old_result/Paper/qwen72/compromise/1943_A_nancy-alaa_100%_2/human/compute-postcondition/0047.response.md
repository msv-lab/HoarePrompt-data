Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and `mpp[i]` is 1.
- `first` is true.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 0, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
