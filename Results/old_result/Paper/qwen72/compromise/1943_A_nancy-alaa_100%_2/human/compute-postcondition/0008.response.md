Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is an input integer that must be non-negative, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0, and `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
