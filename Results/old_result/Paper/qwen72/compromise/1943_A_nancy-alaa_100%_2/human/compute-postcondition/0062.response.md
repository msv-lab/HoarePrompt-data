The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
