Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is False.
- `i` is 1.

The print statement is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 1 in the initial state, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
