Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `a` and the number of elements `n`. The array `a` should be a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to n-1, and `n` is a positive integer. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is either True or False depending on whether a unique integer was found in `arr` before the loop ended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `first` is True if `mpp` contains at least one key with a value of 1, otherwise `first` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the smallest integer not in `mpp` keys or the smallest integer in `mpp` keys with a count of 1 where `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to `n`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
