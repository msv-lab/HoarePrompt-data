Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables do not change, but the `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
