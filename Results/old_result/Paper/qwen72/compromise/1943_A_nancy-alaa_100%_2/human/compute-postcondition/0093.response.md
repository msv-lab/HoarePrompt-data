Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `first` is explicitly set to False.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state. The other variables and objects (`n`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp`) do not affect the value of `i` in this context.

Output: **1**
