### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` for every potential case. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify this claim.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values, which is a good starting point as it ensures that all positions are initially unset.
   - It initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for MEX in the permutation.

3. **Reconstructing Permutation:**
   - The function iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
  - The program assumes that the MEX of the permutation `p` at the start is `n` (since `n` is the largest number and all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are initially assumed to be in the permutation).
  - As the program iterates in reverse order, it updates `mex` to the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the current prefix of `p`.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The key insight is that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
  - Rearranging this, we get `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a[i]`.
  - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly updated for each step. This is because the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is influenced by the values of `p` that have already been set in the current iteration.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. For `n = 1`, the permutation `p` will be `[0]` if `a[0] = 1`, which is valid.
  - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX can be greater than `p_i` in such cases.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

- **First Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex = 5`
  - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 2`
  - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `mex = 5`
  - `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
  - `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
  - `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
  - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - `mex = 3`
  - `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
  - `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
  - `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 0`
  - `p = [2, 0, 1]`
  - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2`, `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` for the given examples and follows the logic described in the function summary. The approach of iterating in reverse and updating `mex` ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and the permutation is constructed to satisfy the given conditions.
