### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies the given `a`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - For each `i`, `a_i` can be rewritten as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) = p_i + a_i`.
   - We need to find `p_i` such that `p_i + a_i` is the MEX of the sequence `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - It starts with `mex` set to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - It iterates from the last element of `a` to the first (i.e., in reverse order).
   - For each `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Initialization**: `p` is initialized to `-1` to ensure that all elements are initially unset.
   - **MEX Calculation**: `mex` is initially set to `n`, which is the largest possible MEX value. As we iterate backwards, `mex` is updated to the smallest value that has not been used yet.
   - **Setting `p[i]`**: The value `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `p_i + a_i` is the current MEX value.
   - **Updating `mex`**: By setting `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, we ensure that the next MEX value is correctly updated to reflect the smallest unused value.

5. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
     - Start with `mex = 5`.
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
   - The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is a valid permutation.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` is a constant array (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), which results in a simple increasing permutation.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, ensuring that the MEX calculation is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given `a` based on the problem description. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

**Correctness: True**
