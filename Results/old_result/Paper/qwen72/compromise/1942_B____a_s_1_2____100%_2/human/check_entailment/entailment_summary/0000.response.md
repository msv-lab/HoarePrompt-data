Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where each element of `a` is defined as \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The key to solving this problem is to understand how the \(\texttt{MEX}\) function works and how to use the given array `a` to reconstruct the permutation `p`.

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for \(\texttt{MEX}\) initially.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates \( p_i \) as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The \(\texttt{MEX}\) of a prefix of the permutation `p` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in that prefix.
  - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of the prefix up to `p[i]` is correctly maintained.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The program calculates \( p_i \) as `mex - a[i]`, which is derived from the given relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - By setting `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`, it ensures that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of the prefix up to `p[i]` is consistent with the value of `a[i]`.

- **Updating `mex`:**
  - The `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` to reflect the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the prefix up to `p[i]`.

- **Handling Multiple Solutions:**
  - The problem guarantees that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data. The program constructs one such permutation, and it is sufficient to print any valid permutation.

### Example Verification:
- For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
  - \( p_5 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5 = 2 \) implies \( p_5 = 3 \).
  - \( p_4 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4 = 1 \) implies \( p_4 = 2 \).
  - \( p_3 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \) implies \( p_3 = 4 \).
  - \( p_2 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2) - p_2 = 1 \) implies \( p_2 = 1 \).
  - \( p_1 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1) - p_1 = 1 \) implies \( p_1 = 0 \).

  The constructed permutation `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` is correct and satisfies the given array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the steps taken are consistent with the problem requirements and the provided examples.
