Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop has completed all its iterations), and for each test case, the list `p` will contain a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. The final value of `n` and the list `a` will remain unchanged for each test case, but they will be re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop.**

To break it down further:
- `t` will be 0 after the loop completes.
- For each test case, the list `p` will be a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where each element `p[i]` is calculated based on the values of `a[i]` and the current `mex`.
- The variables `n` and `a` will retain their values for each test case but will be re-assigned for the next test case.
- The variable `mex` will be updated during each iteration of the inner loop, but its final value will not be relevant after the loop completes.
