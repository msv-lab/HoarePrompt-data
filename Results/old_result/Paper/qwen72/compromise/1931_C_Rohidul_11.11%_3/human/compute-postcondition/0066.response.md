Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, `ans` is `r - l`, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.** 

The value of `ans` is now the difference between `r` and `l`, which is `r - l`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
