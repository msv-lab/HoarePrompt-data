Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t` and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `st` is 1, `end` is 0**

The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so `st` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
