Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is equal to `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**
