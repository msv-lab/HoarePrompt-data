Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `r` is `n - 3` and must be greater than `l`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are all equal, `end` is 1, `ans` is not yet determined, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 3`.
- The condition that `r` must be greater than `l` still holds, as `r` was initially `n - 2` and is now `n - 3`.
- The other variables (`l`, `st`, `end`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` still holds, as `r` has only been decremented by 1.
