Postcondition: **`l` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `r` is the index of the last element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are all equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are all equal, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is determined as follows: If the first element of the list `a` is equal to the last element of the list `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. If `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, then `ans` is `r - l`.**
