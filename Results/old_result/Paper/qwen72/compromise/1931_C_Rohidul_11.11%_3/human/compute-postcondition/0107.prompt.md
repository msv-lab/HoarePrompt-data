You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. After processing each test case, the variables `l` and `r` are indices in the list `a` such that `l` is the largest index where `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r`, and `r` is the smallest index where `a[r] != a[r - 1]` for all `r > l`. `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, and `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal. The variable `ans` is the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that can be removed to make the remaining list have no consecutive equal elements, and it is calculated as follows: If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`. The final output is the maximum of 0 and `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a parameter `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the size of the array, and a parameter `a` which is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= n). The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
