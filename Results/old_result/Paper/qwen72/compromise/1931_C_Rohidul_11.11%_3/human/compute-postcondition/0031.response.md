The code snippet `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between the indices `r` and `l` and assigns this difference to the variable `ans`. The initial state provides that `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, and `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`. Therefore, `ans` will be the number of elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive of `r` but exclusive of `l`).

Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**
