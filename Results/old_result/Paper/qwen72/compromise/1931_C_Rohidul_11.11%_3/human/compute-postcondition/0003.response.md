Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1.**

The initial state remains unchanged for the variables `_`, `t`, `n`, and `a`. The variables `l` and `r` are now assigned specific values: `l` is 0, and `r` is `n` - 1, which is equivalent to `t` - 1.
