Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**

The value of `st` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, preserving their initial values and conditions.
