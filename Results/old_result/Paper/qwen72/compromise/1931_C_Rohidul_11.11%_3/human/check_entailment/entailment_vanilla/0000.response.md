### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes two counters `st` and `end` to keep track of the number of consecutive equal elements from the start and end of the array.

3. **Consecutive Equal Elements:**
   - The program uses two while loops to move the pointers `l` and `r` inward as long as the elements at these positions are equal to their immediate neighbors.
   - This effectively skips over the segments of the array where the elements are already equal.

4. **Conditions for Minimum Cost:**
   - **Case 1:** If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the program calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`. This is because the segments at the start and end are already equal, and we only need to consider the middle segment.
   - **Case 2:** If the first and last elements are not equal and there are no consecutive equal elements at the start or end (`st == 0 and end == 0`), the program calculates the cost as `len(a) - 1`. This is because we need to change all but one element to make the array uniform.
   - **Case 3:** If the first and last elements are not equal but there are some consecutive equal elements at the start or end, the program calculates the cost as `r - l`. This is because we need to change the segment between the first and last non-equal elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated cost, ensuring that the output is always non-negative.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:** The program correctly handles this case by outputting 0, as no operation is needed.
- **Uniform Array:** The program correctly handles this case by outputting 0, as the array is already uniform.
- **Non-Uniform Array:** The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make the array uniform by considering the segments of equal elements and the middle segment.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and edge cases based on the problem description. The logic is sound and follows the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
