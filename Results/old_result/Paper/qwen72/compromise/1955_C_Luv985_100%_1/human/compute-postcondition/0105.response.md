Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `mi`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `mi` is still the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]` based on the value of `r`.
- `a[0]` is still `a[0] - mi`.
- `a[r]` is still `a[r] - mi`.
