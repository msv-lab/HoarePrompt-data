The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. Since `T` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments.

State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4), the function should take three parameters: `T`, a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and a list of lists `a`. `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each pair `(n, k)` in the list of pairs consists of integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15) representing the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, respectively. Each list in `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists `a` should be equal to `T`. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
