Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, the current value of `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `l` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
