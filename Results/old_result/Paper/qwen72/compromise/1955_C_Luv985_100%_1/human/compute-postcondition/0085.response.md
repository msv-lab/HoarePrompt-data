Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and the current value of `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, but the values of `l`, `r`, `mi`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged. The condition that `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k` still holds true after the execution of the code.
