Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `t` is `k % 2`, if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
