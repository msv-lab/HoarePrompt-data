Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r + 1]`) is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
