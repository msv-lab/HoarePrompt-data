Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.** 

The value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, where `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
