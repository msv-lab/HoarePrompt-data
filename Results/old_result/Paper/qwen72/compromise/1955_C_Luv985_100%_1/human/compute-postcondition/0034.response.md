Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- `mi` is updated to the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is now the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
