Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` (if `a[r]` was 0, it remains 0), `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, and if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[r]` was 0 and `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `mi * 2 > k`, then if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `t` is 0 if `k` is even, or 1 if `k` is odd.***
