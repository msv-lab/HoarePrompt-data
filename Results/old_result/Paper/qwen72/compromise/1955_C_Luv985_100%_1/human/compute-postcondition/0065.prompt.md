Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r + 1]`) is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0). `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `ans` is 0 (or 1 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l]` is 0), and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi` (or `a[n - 2] - mi` if `a[r]` is 0). Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` was 0, or 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[l+1]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `a[r-1]` is 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - (2 * mi)`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0 or `a[r]` was 0. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, `ans` is set to 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
