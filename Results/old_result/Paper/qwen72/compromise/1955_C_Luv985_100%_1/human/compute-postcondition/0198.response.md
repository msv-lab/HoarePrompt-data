Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. `t` is 0 if `k` is even, or 1 if `k` is odd.***
