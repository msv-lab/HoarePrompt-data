Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `l` is 0. `r` is `n - 1`. `k` is an integer. `ans` is 0. `T` is decreased by 1. `n` is an integer. `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either `k - 2 * mi` or remains greater than 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0 or 1. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` (if `a[r]` was 0, it remains 0), `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, and if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[r]` was 0 and `a[l]` is 0, then `ans` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `mi * 2 > k`, then if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `t` is 0 if `k` is even, or 1 if `k` is odd.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
