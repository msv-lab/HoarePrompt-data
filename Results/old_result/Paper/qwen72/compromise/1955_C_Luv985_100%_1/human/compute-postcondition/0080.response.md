To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables `l`, `r`, and `k` that are used in the loop condition. The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.

1. **Variable `l`**: The initial state of `l` is 0.
2. **Variable `r`**: The initial state of `r` is `n - 1`.
3. **Variable `k`**: The initial state of `k` is an integer.

For the loop to execute:
- `l` must be less than `r`.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `l` is already less than `r` if `n` is greater than 1. However, `k` being an integer does not ensure that `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0**
