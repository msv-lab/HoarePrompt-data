Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, after the decrement, `r` is now `n - 2` or `n - 3` or `n - 4`.
- The values of `l`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `mi`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
