Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0) minus 2 times `mi`, `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.** 

The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
