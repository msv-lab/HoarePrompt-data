Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is `k - (2 * mi)`, `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value.
- The values of `T`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `mi` is still the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- `a[l]` and `a[r]` are updated by subtracting `mi` from their respective values.
