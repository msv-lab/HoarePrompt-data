Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`. `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 1`. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`.***
