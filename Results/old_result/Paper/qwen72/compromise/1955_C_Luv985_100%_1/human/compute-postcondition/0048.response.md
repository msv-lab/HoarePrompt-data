Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0). `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `ans` is 0 (or 1 if `a[r]` is 0 or `a[l]` is 0), and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi` (or `a[n - 2] - mi` if `a[r]` is 0). Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
