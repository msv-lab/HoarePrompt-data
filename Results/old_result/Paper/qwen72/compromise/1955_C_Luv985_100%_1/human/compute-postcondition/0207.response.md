The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `pairs`. 

- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `pairs` is a list of pairs, where each pair `(n, k)` consists of integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15). Here, `n` represents the number of ships, and `k` represents the number of attacks by the Kraken.
- `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships for each test case.

The length of the list `pairs` and the list `a` should be equal to `t`. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the result indicates the number of ships that remain after the Kraken has attacked `k` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of pairs `pairs` where each pair `(n, k)` represents the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, and a list of lists `a` where each inner list contains the durability of the ships. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of ships that remain after the Kraken has attacked `k` times for each test case.**
