### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Breakdown**:
   - **Introverts**: Each introvert needs their own tent.
   - **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals**: They can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with `universals` to form a complete tent. If not, it returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as required, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing their own tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All Introverts**: If there are only introverts, each will need their own tent, and the function should return the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts**: If there are only extroverts, the number of tents needed should be `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals**: If there are only universals, the number of tents needed should be `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases**: The function should handle mixed cases correctly by ensuring that extroverts are always in tents with exactly two others, and universals can fill in the gaps as needed.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided test cases and expected outputs are consistent with the logic implemented in the functions.
   - For example, in the test case `1 2 3`, the function correctly calculates that 1 tent is needed for the introvert, 1 tent for the two extroverts and one universal, and 1 tent for the remaining two universals, totaling 3 tents.
   - In the test case `1 4 1`, the function correctly identifies that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as required, returning -1.

### Conclusion:
The functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They handle all edge cases and mixed scenarios as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True****
