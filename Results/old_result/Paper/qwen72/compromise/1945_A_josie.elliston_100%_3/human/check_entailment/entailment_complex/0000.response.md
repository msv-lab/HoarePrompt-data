### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If so, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to the rules.
   - If the above condition is not met, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, and any remaining people (less than 3) will need an additional tent.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) and the result from `func_1`.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, and prints the result of `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
  - Introverts: 1 (1 tent needed)
  - Extroverts: 2 (2 extroverts need 1 tent, and 1 universal can join them)
  - Universals: 3 (2 universals can join the extroverts, and 1 universal can live alone)
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3

- **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
  - Introverts: 1 (1 tent needed)
  - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts need 2 tents, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots)
  - Universals: 1 (1 universal cannot fill the remaining spots for extroverts)
  - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate all extroverts)

- **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
  - Introverts: 1 (1 tent needed)
  - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts need 2 tents, and 2 universals can fill the remaining spots)
  - Universals: 2 (2 universals can fill the remaining spots for extroverts)
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3

- **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
  - Introverts: 1 (1 tent needed)
  - Extroverts: 1 (1 extrovert needs 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spots)
  - Universals: 1 (1 universal cannot fill the remaining spots for extroverts)
  - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate all extroverts)

- **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
  - Introverts: 1 (1 tent needed)
  - Extroverts: 3 (3 extroverts need 1 tent, and 2 universals can live alone or together)
  - Universals: 2 (2 universals can live alone or together)
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3

- **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
  - Introverts: 19 (19 tents needed)
  - Extroverts: 7 (7 extroverts need 3 tents, and 18 universals can fill the remaining spots)
  - Universals: 18 (18 universals can fill the remaining spots for extroverts)
  - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
  - Introverts: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Extroverts: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Universals: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Total tents: 0

- **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
  - Introverts: 7 (7 tents needed)
  - Extroverts: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Universals: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Total tents: 7

- **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
  - Introverts: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Extroverts: 24 (24 extroverts need 8 tents)
  - Universals: 0 (0 tents needed)
  - Total tents: 8

- **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
  - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents needed)
  - Extroverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents, and 1000000000 universals can fill the remaining spots)
  - Universals: 1000000000 (1000000000 universals can fill the remaining spots for extroverts)
  - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the problem description. It ensures that introverts get their own tents, extroverts are accommodated in groups of three, and universals are used to fill any remaining spots. The program also correctly returns -1 when it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.

### Correctness:
**True**
