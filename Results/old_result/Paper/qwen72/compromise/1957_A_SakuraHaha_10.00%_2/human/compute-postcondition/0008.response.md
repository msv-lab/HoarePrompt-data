To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`cnt`**: This is a dictionary. The exact contents of the dictionary are not provided, but it is assumed to contain integer values.
2. **`ans`**: This variable is defined as the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4. Floor division (`//`) returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.

Given the initial state, the `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4.

Since the exact values in the dictionary `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4)**
