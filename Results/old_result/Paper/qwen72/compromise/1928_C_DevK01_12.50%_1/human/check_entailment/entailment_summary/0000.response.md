### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is in a line and receives a number based on a repeating pattern of length `2k - 2`.
   - The pattern is: `1, 2, 3, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - We need to find how many values of `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the given position `n` and number `x`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position `n` and the number `x` are related by the pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The number `x` can appear in two segments of the pattern: the first `k` numbers and the next `k - 2` numbers.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - For the first segment (1 to k): `x` can be any number from 1 to `k`.
   - For the second segment (k-1 to 2): `x` can be any number from `k-1` to 2.
   - The position `n` can be expressed as `n = (2k - 2) * m + p`, where `m` is the number of complete cycles and `p` is the position within the current cycle.
   - We need to check if `p` can be a valid position for `x` in the pattern.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates `q = (y - 2) // 2` and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional valid `k` values.
   - The results from both calls are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It also includes the square root of `q` if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The function returns a list of these divisors.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing 0.
   - The calculation of `q` and the subsequent calls to `func_1` are logical and align with the problem's constraints.
   - The program correctly combines the results from both calls and removes duplicates.
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. The logic and steps are well-aligned with the problem's requirements.
