Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`.
- The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, `q`, `n`, and the initial `k` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
