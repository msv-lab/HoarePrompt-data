Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `ans1` is `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l)) - 2`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so the new value of `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l)) - 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
