The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `c[i]` is equal to `c[0]`.

Therefore, the value of `c[0]` is appended to `ans2`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[0]`.**
