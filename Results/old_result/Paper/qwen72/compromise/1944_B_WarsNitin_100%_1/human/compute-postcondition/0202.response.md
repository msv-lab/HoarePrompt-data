Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` contains all its original elements, `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended once, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - len(l)`, `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended once, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `ans1`, `k` (previously defined), `ans2`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `n` and `k` are input integers, while the rest of the state remains as described in the initial state.
