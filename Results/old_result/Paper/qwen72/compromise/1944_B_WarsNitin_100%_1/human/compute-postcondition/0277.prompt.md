Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`. If `k` is 0, the loop has broken early. Otherwise, `k` has been decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `b` between indices 1 and `n-2`. `ans1` contains the elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice. `l` contains the elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. `k` is now equal to `req`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `req - 2` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains `req`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice. `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is `req - 2` if `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, and `k` is `req - 4` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is `req - 2` if `c[i] != c[i - 1]` and `k` is `req - 6` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. `ans1` contains elements from `b` that were found to be equal to their preceding element, each appended twice, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their preceding or following element, excluding the first and last elements of `b`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[i]`, and `c[3]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
