The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `k`, we only know that `k` is reduced by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[3]` in addition to any previous values, `k` is decreased by 2.**
