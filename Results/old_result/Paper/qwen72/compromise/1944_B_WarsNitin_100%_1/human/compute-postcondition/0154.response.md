Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, and `k` is now equal to `req`. `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration. `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged.**
