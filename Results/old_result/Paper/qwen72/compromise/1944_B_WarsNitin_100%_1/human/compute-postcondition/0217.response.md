The code `ans1.append(b[n - 1])` appends the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`
- `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise
- `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists
- `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order
- `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order
- `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`
- `q` is `t`
- `t` must be greater than `t - 1`
- `n` and `k` are input integers

After executing the code:
- `ans1` now contains the element at index `n - 1` of the list `b`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is either `[b[0]]` if `b[0] != b[1]` or remains an empty list otherwise, `ans1` is `[b[n - 1]]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` are input integers.**
