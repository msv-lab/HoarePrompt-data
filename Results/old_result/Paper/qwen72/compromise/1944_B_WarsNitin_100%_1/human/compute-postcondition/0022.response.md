Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains two instances of the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times the original input integer, `l` is a list that may contain the first element of `b` if it is not equal to the second element of `b`, and if `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `l` remains as it was initially.***
