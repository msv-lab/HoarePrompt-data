Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The variables `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The line `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.
- Therefore, `n` and `k` are now input integers.
