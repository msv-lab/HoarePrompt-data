Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. The loop terminates when `i` reaches `n-1` or when `k` becomes 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` must contain at least one element, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, plus the first element of `l` (appended once), `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - 1` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop. `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now includes the first element of `l` appended once.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` must contain at least 2 elements, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, plus the first element of `l` (appended once), and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once), `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - 2` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the first element of `l` appended once, and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once). If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` must contain at least 3 elements, `ans1` contains elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, each appended twice, plus the first element of `l` (appended once), and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once), and now also includes `l[2]` (appended once), `k` is now equal to `req - 2 * m - 3` where `m` is the number of times `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true during the loop, `l` contains elements from `b` that are unique and not equal to their adjacent elements, up to the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged, if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was true for any `i`, `ans2` now includes the corresponding values of `c[i]` appended twice, otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged, `ans2` now includes the first element of `l` appended once, and now also includes `l[1]` (appended once), and now also includes `l[2]` (appended once). If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
