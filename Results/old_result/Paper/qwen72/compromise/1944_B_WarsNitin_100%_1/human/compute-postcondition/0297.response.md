Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has at least `k` elements (or fewer if `k` reached 0 before the loop finished), `ans1` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `len(l) - 1`**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `l`, starting from 0 and ending at `len(l) - 1`.
- **`l` has at least `k` elements (or fewer if `k` reached 0 before the loop finished)**: The loop appends elements from `l` to `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` becomes 0 or all elements of `l` are processed.
- **`ans1` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`**: The loop appends elements from `l` to `ans1` until either `k` becomes 0 or all elements of `l` are processed.
- **`ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`**: Similarly, `ans2` also contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`.
- **`k` is `max(0, k - len(l))`**: After the loop, `k` is reduced by the number of elements processed, but it cannot be negative, so it is clamped to 0 if it goes below 0.
