Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` is an empty list, `ans1` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `ans2` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (req - 2 * m - len(l))`, `q` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = []` reassigns `l` to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `k`, `ans2`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about these variables is preserved in the output state.
