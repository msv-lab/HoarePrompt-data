The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure the loop condition `i < n - 1` holds true.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
