Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes the value of `b[1]` and `b[1]` again, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes the value of `b[i]`.***
