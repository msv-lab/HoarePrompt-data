The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` in the list satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) for each `x` in the list `test_cases`, such that the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is maximized.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) for each `x` in `test_cases`, such that the sum of `y` and the gcd of `x` and `y` is maximized.**
