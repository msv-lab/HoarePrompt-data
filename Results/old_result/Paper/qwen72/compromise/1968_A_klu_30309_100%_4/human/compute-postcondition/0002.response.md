Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x in the list satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, results is a list of integers where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is maximized for each x in test_cases.**
