Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.**

However, since the function definition provided is incomplete, I will provide the correct function definition and its precondition:

Correct Function Definition:
```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values in test_cases does not exceed 10^6.**
