The function `func` is expected to accept parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Assuming the correct function definition is used, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input string `s` and its length `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input string `s` and its length `n`. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.**
