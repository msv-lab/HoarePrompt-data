You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s`, then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and prints the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `s` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input string `s` and its length `n`. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
