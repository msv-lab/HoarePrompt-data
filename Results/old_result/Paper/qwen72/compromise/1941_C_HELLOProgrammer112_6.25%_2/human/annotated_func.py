#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s`, then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, and prints the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `s` are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that the input variables `a` and `s` are no longer relevant.
