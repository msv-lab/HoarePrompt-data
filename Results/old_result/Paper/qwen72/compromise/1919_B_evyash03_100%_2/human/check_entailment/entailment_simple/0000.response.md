Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in the string `expression`. This does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic to evaluate different possible splits and their penalties.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`. The provided program would instead return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which happens to be correct in this case but is not the result of an optimal split strategy.

However, the program fails in other cases. For the fourth test case where `s = "--+++++++-"`, the optimal split could be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `2 + 5 + 1 = 8`, but the program returns `abs(4 - 6) = 2`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum possible penalty for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
