The value of `sub` is calculated as `length - count`. The initial state specifies that `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, but the value of `length` is not provided. Therefore, `sub` is equal to the difference between `length` and the number of "+" characters in `expression`. The state of `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` is equal to `length - count`.**
