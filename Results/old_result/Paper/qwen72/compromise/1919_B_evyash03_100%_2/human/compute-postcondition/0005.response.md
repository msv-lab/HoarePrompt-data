The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000. The function returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`, where `sub` is equal to `length - count` and `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`, and returns the absolute difference between the length of the string and the number of "+" characters in the string.**
