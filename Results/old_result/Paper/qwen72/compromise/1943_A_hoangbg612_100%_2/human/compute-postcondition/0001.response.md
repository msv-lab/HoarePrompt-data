The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of the list `a` and the integer `n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
