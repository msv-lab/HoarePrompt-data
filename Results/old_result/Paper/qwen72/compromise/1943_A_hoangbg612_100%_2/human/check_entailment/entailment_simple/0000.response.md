### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted, which is a necessary step to ensure that the elements are processed in ascending order.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `cur` to -1, which is used to track the current MEX value.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `N`.
   - The loop iterates through each element in `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the frequency in `M`.
   - If the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle the case where all elements are used, but it is not necessary for the MEX calculation and might be incorrect.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by checking the frequencies of elements in `M`.
   - It creates a list `cnt` to store elements that appear exactly once in `N`.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`. This step is intended to handle the optimal strategy, but it is not clear why the second element is chosen.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Sum Check:**
  - The line `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The sum of the frequencies should always equal the length of the array `N`, and this check does not contribute to the MEX calculation.
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is not aligned with the optimal strategy. Alice and Bob should be making decisions based on the MEX value, not just the frequency of elements.
- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The program should directly calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(cur)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:**
  - `cur` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer.
- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The loop iterates through the sorted array `N`.
  - If the current element `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments `cur` by 1.
  - If `num` is greater than `cur`, the loop breaks, and `cur` is the MEX.
- **Output:**
  - The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical issues in the MEX calculation and the handling of the optimal strategy. The corrected program provides a more accurate and efficient solution to the problem.
