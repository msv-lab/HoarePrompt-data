Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a for loop. However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is not ideal but works in this context because `func_1` reads input directly within the function.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the string `s` and converts it into a list of characters, which is a reasonable approach for manipulating the string.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The function attempts to find the longest tandem repeat by iterating over possible lengths `j` from `n // 2` down to 1. This is a good approach because the longest possible tandem repeat would be half the length of the string.

4. **Character Comparison**: For each possible length `j`, the function checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either equal or one of them is a question mark. If they match, it increments the `count`. If they don't match, it resets the `count`.

5. **Tandem Repeat Detection**: If the `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `count * 2` and returns. This is correct because a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` is detected.

6. **No Tandem Repeat Found**: If the loop completes without finding any tandem repeat, the function prints `0`. This is also correct because it handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where the string contains no question marks and no tandem repeats (e.g., "codeforces").

8. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough for the given constraints, as it iterates over the string in a nested loop, but the total complexity is manageable given the constraints (total length of all strings does not exceed 5000).

However, there is a minor issue in the program:

- **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass the string `s` as an argument to `func_1` to make the function more modular and testable.

Despite this minor issue, the program logic is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
