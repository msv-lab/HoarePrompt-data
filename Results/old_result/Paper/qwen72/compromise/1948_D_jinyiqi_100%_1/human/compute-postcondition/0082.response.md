Output State: **`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, and `count` is the final count value after all iterations. If `count` equals `j` at any point during the iterations, the program prints `count * 2` and returns. Otherwise, `count` is the number of consecutive successful checks (where `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) before the loop completes.**

In natural language:
- The initial state variables `t`, `s_list`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The variable `j` is still `n // 2 - 2`.
- The variable `k` is now `n - j`, which is the number of iterations the loop has completed.
- The variable `count` is the final count of consecutive successful checks (where `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`) before the loop completes.
- If at any point during the iterations, `count` equals `j`, the program prints `count * 2` and returns, effectively ending the loop.
- If the loop completes without `count` ever reaching `j`, `count` will be the number of consecutive successful checks that were made.
