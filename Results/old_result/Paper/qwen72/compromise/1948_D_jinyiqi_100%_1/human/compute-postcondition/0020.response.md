Postcondition: ***`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns the value of `count` which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the conditions `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]` are met. If any of these conditions are true, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0. If `count` is not equal to `j`, the program does not return a value and `count` retains its value.***
