Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case.
3. `s` is a list of characters from one of the input strings in `s_list`.
4. `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
5. `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
6. `k` is 0.
7. If `s[0]` is '?', `s[j]` is '?', or `s[0]` is equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
8. `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.
9. Additionally, `count` is equal to `j`.

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.
- This means the condition `s[0] is '?', s[j] is '?', or s[0] is equal to s[j]` is false.
- Therefore, `count` is 0.
- However, the initial state also states that `count` is equal to `j`.
- Since `count` is 0, `j` must also be 0.

### Calculation:
- `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
- For `j` to be 0, the equation `n // 2 - 1 = 0` must hold.
- Solving for `n`, we get `n // 2 = 1`, which means `n = 2`.

### Final Output:
- `count` is 0.
- The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
- Therefore, `count * 2` is `0 * 2`, which equals 0.

Output: **0**
