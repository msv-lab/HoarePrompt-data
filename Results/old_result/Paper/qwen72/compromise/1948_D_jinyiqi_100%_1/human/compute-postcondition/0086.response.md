Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a single string `s` of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for specific patterns in the string by iterating over its characters and comparing them with characters at a distance `j` from them. If a pattern of length `j` is found where each character or its counterpart at distance `j` is either a question mark or identical, the function prints `2 * j` and returns. If no such pattern is found after all iterations, the function prints `0` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
