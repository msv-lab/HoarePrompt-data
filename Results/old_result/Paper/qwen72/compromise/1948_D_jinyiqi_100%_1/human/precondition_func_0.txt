The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s_list` where each string is a test case.
