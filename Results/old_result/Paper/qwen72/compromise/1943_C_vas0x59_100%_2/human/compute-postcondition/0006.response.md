Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, inclusive, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]`, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `u2vs` still has `n` elements, but the list at index `u` (after `u` has been decreased by 1) now contains the value `v` (after `v` has been decreased by 1).
- The values of `u` and `v` are each decreased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
