Output State: **`path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has terminated because it has reached the starting node `a`. `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`, which is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) retain their original values. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba`.**
