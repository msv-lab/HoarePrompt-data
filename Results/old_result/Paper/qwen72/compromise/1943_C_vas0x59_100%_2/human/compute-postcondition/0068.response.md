Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `path_ba` contains the full path from node `b` to node `a` in reverse order, with `a` being the last element in the list. `n` is -1, `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`, which is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci1`, `c2` is the element in `path_ba` at the index `ci2`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` values from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`. The length of `path_ba` is even.**
