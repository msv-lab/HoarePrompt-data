Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases, and the variables t, n, and k remain unchanged as they are input variables. The output for each test case is determined by the conditions within the loop: if k is 1, the output is 1; if k is less than or equal to 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the output is the ceiling of k divided by 2; otherwise, the output is k divided by 2 (integer division) plus 1.**
