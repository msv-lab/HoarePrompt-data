Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum of `n // k` and `k` to `Min`, and the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` to `Max`. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same, and the other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `Min` and `Max` while keeping the initial state of the other variables.
