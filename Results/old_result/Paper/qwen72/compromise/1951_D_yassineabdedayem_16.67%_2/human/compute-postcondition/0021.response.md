Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer and `k` is now equal to `k - Max`, `rep` is 1, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `Min`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` are still valid, with the only change being the updated value of `k`.
