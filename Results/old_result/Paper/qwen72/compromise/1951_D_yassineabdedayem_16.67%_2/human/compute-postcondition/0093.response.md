To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `tab`. The loop will execute if `tab` contains at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `tab` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer
- `k` is 0
- `rep` is 60 or less
- `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers
- The loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true

We need to adjust the state to ensure `tab` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The state of `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, `i` is the first element of `tab`**
