Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `Min` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is equal to `Max`, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `tab` is a list that now includes the string representation of `number`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**
