Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it attempts to decompose `n` into a sum of products of two integers, where one integer is at most `k` and the other is a divisor of `n`. The function records these products in a list `tab` and stops after 60 iterations or when `n` cannot be further decomposed under the given constraints. If `k` is reduced to 0, the function prints "YES" followed by the number of elements in `tab` and the elements themselves. If `k` is not 0, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, `n` is 0 or a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, and `rep` is the total number of times the loop executed (at most 60). **
