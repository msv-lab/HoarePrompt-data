Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
- **`n`**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` will be 0. This is because the loop continues to subtract `Min * Max` from `n` until `n` is no longer greater than or equal to `k`.
- **`k`**: This variable will be a positive integer or 0. It is updated in each iteration by subtracting either `Min` or `Max` from it, depending on the conditions inside the loop.
- **`rep`**: This variable will be the number of times the loop executed, which can be at most 60. The loop will stop if `rep` reaches 60, or if any of the other conditions (`n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `n >= k`) are no longer true.
- **`tab`**: This list will contain the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop. Each time the loop runs, it appends the string representation of `number` to `tab`.

The loop effectively reduces `n` by subtracting products of `Min` and `Max` until `n` is 0, and it also updates `k` and `rep` accordingly. The `tab` list keeps track of the `number` values computed in each iteration.
