To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is a non-zero integer (satisfies `n != 0`)
- `k` is a positive integer (satisfies `k > 0`)
- `rep` is 1 (satisfies `rep < 60`)
- `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`
- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is updated to `0`
- Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`

We need to ensure that the conditions in the `while` loop head are still satisfied for the next iteration:

1. **`n != 0`**: Since `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero after this update. This depends on the values of `Min` and `Max`.
2. **`k > 0`**: `k` is updated based on the conditions. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - Min`. We need to ensure that `k` remains positive.
3. **`rep < 60`**: `rep` is 1, so it will still be less than 60 for the next iteration.
4. **`n >= k`**: This condition depends on the updated values of `n` and `k`.

Let's break down the conditions:

- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to `0`, which would violate the condition `k > 0`. Therefore, this scenario must be avoided for the loop to execute again.
- Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and we need to ensure that `k - Min` is still positive.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, and we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to `k` after this update.

Given the current state, the only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to ensure that `k` remains positive and `n` remains non-zero and greater than or equal to `k` after the updates. Since `k` is a positive integer and `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `k - Min` will be positive as long as `k` is greater than `Min`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than `Min` and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` after the update.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`**
