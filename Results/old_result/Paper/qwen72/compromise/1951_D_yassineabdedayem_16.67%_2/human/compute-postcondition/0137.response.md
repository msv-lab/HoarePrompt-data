Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, and `tab` now has an additional element which is the string representation of `number`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The initial state specifies that `tab` already contains the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`.
- After appending, `tab` will have an additional element, which is the string representation of `number`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and the conditions for updating `k` and `number` remain unchanged.
