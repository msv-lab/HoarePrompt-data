Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.**
