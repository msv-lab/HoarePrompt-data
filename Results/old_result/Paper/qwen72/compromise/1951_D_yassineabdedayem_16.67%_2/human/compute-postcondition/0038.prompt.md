Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 2, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `tab` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the updated `number`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rep` is increased by 1, `Min` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is equal to `Max`, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `tab` is a list that now includes the string representation of `number`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
