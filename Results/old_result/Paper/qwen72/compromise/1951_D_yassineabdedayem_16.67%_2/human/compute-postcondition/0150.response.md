Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` must have at least `rep` elements, `i` is the last element of `tab`**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `rep` still represents the number of times the loop executed, which is at most 60. The list `tab` must have at least as many elements as the value of `rep` because the loop iterates over each element in `tab`. The variable `i` will be the last element of `tab` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
