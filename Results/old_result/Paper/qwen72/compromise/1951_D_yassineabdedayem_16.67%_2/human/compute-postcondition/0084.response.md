Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and `n - Min * Max` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string representations, `k` is `k - Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n - Min * Max` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k` is still valid, but `k` is now `k - Min`.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 after being updated to `k - Min` or `k - Max` is still valid, but `k` is now `k - Min`.
- `Min` is still the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is still the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `number` remains `Max`.
