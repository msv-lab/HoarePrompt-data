Based on the provided initial state, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is a simple command to print the string `'YES'`.
3. Since there are no conditions or variables affecting the `print` statement, it will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
