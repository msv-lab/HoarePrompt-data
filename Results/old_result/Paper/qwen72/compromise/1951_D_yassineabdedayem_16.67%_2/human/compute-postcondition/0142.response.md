Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60).
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop.

The code snippet to be evaluated is:
```
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
