Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input positive integer or 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string representations of numbers. If `k` is 0, the loop has finished executing all elements in `tab`. If `k` is a positive integer, the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.**
