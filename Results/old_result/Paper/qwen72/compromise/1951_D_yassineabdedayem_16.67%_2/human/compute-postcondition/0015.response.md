The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged. The list `tab` now contains one element, which is the string representation of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.**
