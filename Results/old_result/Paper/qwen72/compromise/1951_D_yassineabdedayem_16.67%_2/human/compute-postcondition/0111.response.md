Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is `Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` equals `k`, and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `Min` to `number`.
- `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, so `number` now holds the value of `Min`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
