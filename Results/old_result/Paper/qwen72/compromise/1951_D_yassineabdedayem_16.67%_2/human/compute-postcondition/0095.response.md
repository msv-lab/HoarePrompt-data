The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, and `i` is the first element of `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least 2 elements. The variable `i` will be set to the second element of `tab` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, `i` is the second element of `tab`**
