Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is set to `Min` and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `number` is set to `Max` and `k` is set to `k - Min`.**
