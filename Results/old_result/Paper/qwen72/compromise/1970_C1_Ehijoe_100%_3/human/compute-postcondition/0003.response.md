Output State: **`n` and `t` are input integers, `n` is between 2 and 200,000, `t` is between 1 and `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `nodes` is now a defaultdict where the default factory is a list. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a list for any new key that is accessed.
