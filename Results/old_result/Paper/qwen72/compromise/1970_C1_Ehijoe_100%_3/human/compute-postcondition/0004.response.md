The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` is between 2 and 200,000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 200,000, `i` is 0**
