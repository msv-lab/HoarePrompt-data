### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the chosen substring.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
   - The output for each test case is the minimum total cost to sort the string.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the minimum total cost.
   - The function iterates through the string and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - If a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm works by identifying the transitions from '1' to '0' and calculating the cost of moving the '0' past all the '1's before it.
   - Each time a '0' is encountered after some '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's plus one (the length of the substring including the '0' and all preceding '1's).
   - This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order by moving each '0' to the correct position with the minimum cost.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost will be zero, which is correct.
   - If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the cost will also be zero, which is correct.
   - For strings like "101011", the algorithm correctly identifies the transitions and calculates the cost.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For "10", the cost is 2 (one operation: "10" -> "01").
   - For "0000", the cost is 0 (no operations needed).
   - For "11000", the cost is 9 (three operations: "11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011").
   - For "101011", the cost is 5 (one operation: "101011" -> "011011" and another: "011011" -> "011101").
   - For "01101001", the cost is 11 (multiple operations to sort the string).

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `s` is a binary string with a length of 2 or more, and the length of `s` does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - `cost` is initialized to 0.
  - `one` is initialized to 0.
  - The function iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
  - If `i` is '1', `one` is incremented.
  - If `i` is '0' and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.
  - The function returns the total cost.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
  - The cost calculation is based on the number of '1's encountered before a '0'. This is correct because each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's before it to achieve a sorted string.
  - The cost for each '0' is `one + 1`, which is the length of the substring including the '0' and all preceding '1's. This is the minimum cost required to move the '0' to the correct position.

- **Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles strings that are already sorted or contain only '0's or '1's.
  - For strings with mixed '0's and '1's, the function correctly identifies the transitions and calculates the cost.

- **Example Verification**:
  - The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the function, as verified in the original assessment.

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic and the cost calculation are accurate for the given problem description.
