The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, with a length of 2 or more, and the length of `s` does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns the total number of times '0' appears in `s` after a '1', with each occurrence contributing `one + 1` to the cost, where `one` is the number of '1's in `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total cost calculated by counting the number of '0's that appear after a '1' in the string, with each '0' contributing `one + 1` to the cost, where `one` is the number of '1's in `s`.**
