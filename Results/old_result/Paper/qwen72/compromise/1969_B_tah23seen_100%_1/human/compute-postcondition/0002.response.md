The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. Since the state already indicates that `s` is a binary string with a length of 2 or more, this condition is already satisfied. The variable `i` will take on the values of the characters in `s` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided, with the understanding that `i` will be the first character of `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of 2 or more, and the length of `s` does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, `cost` is 0, `one` is 0, `i` is the first character of `s`**
