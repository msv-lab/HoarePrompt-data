The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for each test case: `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, with each test case involving the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of sale days (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
- `m`: an integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9).
- `k`: an integer representing the total number of tickets to be bought (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)).
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function processes these inputs to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to buy (`k`), and a list of prices per ticket for each day (`a`). It returns the minimum cost to buy exactly `k` tickets across the given days, adhering to the daily purchase limit.**
