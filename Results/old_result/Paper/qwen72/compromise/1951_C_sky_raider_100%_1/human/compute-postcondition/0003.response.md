The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `l` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by user input.**
