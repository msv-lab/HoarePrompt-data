Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- The value of `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, this means `c` is now `c + s * (l[1] + t)`.
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + s`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`.

All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
