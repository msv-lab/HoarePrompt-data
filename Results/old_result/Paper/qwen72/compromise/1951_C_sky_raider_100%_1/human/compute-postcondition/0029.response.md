Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is the minimum value between the new `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + t)`, `t` is `0`, `k` is `k - (n-1) * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is set to `0`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, `l`) retain their previous values or are calculated based on the initial state.
- The value of `c` is updated using the formula provided, but since `t` is now `0`, the expression simplifies to `c + s * (l[0] + 0) + s * (l[1] + 0) + ... + s * (l[n-1] + 0)`, which is `c + s * (l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1])`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (n-1) * s`.
