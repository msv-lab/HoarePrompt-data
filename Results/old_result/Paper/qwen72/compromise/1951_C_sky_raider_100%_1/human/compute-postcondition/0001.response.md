The code snippet takes an input from the user, which is expected to contain three integers separated by spaces. These integers are then unpacked into the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the input is required to be greater than 0, each of these variables will hold a positive integer value.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer**
