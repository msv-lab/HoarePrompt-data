The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[0] + t) + s * (l[1] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * s`, `k` is `k - s`**
