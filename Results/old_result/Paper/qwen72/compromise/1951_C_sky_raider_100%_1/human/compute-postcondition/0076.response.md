Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to buy (`k`), and a list of prices per ticket for each day (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets, considering the daily purchase limit and the sorted ticket prices. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the printed minimum costs for each test case. The input variables `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `k` is reduced to 0 or a non-negative integer less than `m`. **
