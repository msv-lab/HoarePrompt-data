Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting Prices**: The ticket prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which is a key strategy to minimize the total cost.
3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices, purchasing the maximum possible number of tickets (`min(m, k)`) each day until all `k` tickets are purchased. It also correctly updates the total cost and the number of tickets left to purchase.
4. **Price Increase**: The program correctly accounts for the price increase after each purchase by adding the number of tickets purchased to the price increment (`t`).

The program efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
