Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of elements in the array, such as `def func(a, n):`, where `a` is a list of integers and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each element `a_i` in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
