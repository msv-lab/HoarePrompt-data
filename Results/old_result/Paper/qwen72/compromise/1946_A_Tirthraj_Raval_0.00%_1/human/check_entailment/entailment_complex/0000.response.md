Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. However, the program simply counts the occurrences of the current median in the sorted array and prints this count. This does not address the requirement to find the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` should take parameters for the array and the number of elements in the array, as mentioned in the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(a, n):`.

2. **Logic for Increasing the Median**: The program does not implement any logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Instead, it calculates the index `p` of the current median in the sorted array and prints the count of the element at this index. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

3. **Expected Output**: The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples. For instance, for the first test case `[2, 2, 8]`, the program prints `2` (the count of the median `2`), but the correct output should be `1` (the minimum number of operations to increase the median to `3`).

To correct the program, we need to implement logic that:

1. Determines the current median of the array.
2. Finds the smallest number greater than the current median.
3. Calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the current median equal to this smallest number greater than the current median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # Find the smallest number greater than the current median
        next_median = current_median + 1
        while next_median not in a[p+1:]:
            next_median += 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations required
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **False**
