Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The program checks if any frequency of a card is exactly `k` and then prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations on different groups of cards or the fact that the minimum number of cards left can be less than `k - 1` in some cases.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` correctly builds a frequency table, but it caps the frequency at `k` for each card. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the frequency of a card is greater than `k`.

2. **Final Output Logic**: The program's final output logic is too simplistic. It should consider the total number of cards that can be removed through the operations, not just whether any single card has a frequency of `k`.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be removed by repeatedly performing the operation on groups of cards that have a frequency of at least `k`. The minimum number of cards left will be the remainder of the total number of cards when divided by `k - 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        total_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            total_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        
        print(total_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each card number.
3. **Total Cards Calculation**: For each frequency, it calculates how many cards can be removed by performing the operation as many times as possible. Specifically, for each group of `k` cards, `k - 1` cards are removed.
4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of cards left after performing all possible operations.

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of cards left in your hand after performing the operations.
