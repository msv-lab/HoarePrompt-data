### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - It also initializes two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

3. **First Loop (for `A` and `idx_A`):**
   - This loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character encountered, it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters and their positions relative to the last '<' character.
   - The cumulative count is stored in `A`, and the index is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Second Loop (for `B` and `idx_B`):**
   - This loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character encountered, it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters and their positions relative to the last '>' character.
   - The cumulative count is stored in `B`, and the index is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Third Loop (for each query):**
   - This loop iterates through the string `s` to handle each query.
   - Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The calculations involve using the cumulative counts and positions stored in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query in the format specified.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of `A` and `idx_A` Calculation:**
  - The cumulative count for '>' characters is correctly calculated and stored in `A`.
  - The indices of '>' characters are correctly stored in `idx_A`.

- **Correctness of `B` and `idx_B` Calculation:**
  - The cumulative count for '<' characters is correctly calculated and stored in `B`.
  - The indices of '<' characters are correctly stored in `idx_B` in reverse order.

- **Correctness of Query Handling:**
  - The logic for handling each query is complex but appears to correctly account for the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.
  - The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball starts on a '>' or '<' character and calculates the time it takes to leave the grid.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the pinball movement and the inversion of characters. The calculations for each query are consistent with the problem description, and the program handles all edge cases as described.
