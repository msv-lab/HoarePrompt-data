### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative values for movements to the right and left, respectively.

3. **Array `A`**:
   - `A` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '>'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `>` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_A` that keeps track of the positions of `>`.
   - The logic for populating `A` and `idx_A` is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Array `B`**:
   - `B` is used to store the cumulative time for pinballs starting at positions where `s[i] == '<'`.
   - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to reach the next `<` position and adds it to the cumulative sum.
   - This is done by maintaining an index list `idx_B` that keeps track of the positions of `<`.
   - The logic for populating `B` and `idx_B` is correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over each position `i` in the string `s` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current position `i` contains `>` or `<`, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios, such as the pinball moving to the left or right and the positions of the nearest `>` and `<`.
   - The calculations for `a` and `b` are based on the cumulative values and the positions of the nearest `>` and `<` characters, which are correctly handled by the program.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the first or last cell and moves out of the grid immediately.
   - It also handles cases where there are no `<` or `>` in the string, ensuring that the pinball leaves the grid in the correct number of steps.
   - The conditions for `l < r`, `r == 0`, and `l - r` are correctly implemented to handle these edge cases.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the `A` and `B` arrays.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the Program Before Function Call**:
  - The state is correctly described: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and the function `func_1` is called with this string.

- **State After Populating `A` and `idx_A`**:
  - `A` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '<' character.
  - `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' characters are found in the string `s`.
  - The state is correctly described and matches the program's behavior.

- **State After Populating `B` and `idx_B`**:
  - `A` remains unchanged.
  - `idx_A` remains unchanged.
  - `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '>' character.
  - `idx_B` is a list of indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`, in reverse order.
  - The state is correctly described and matches the program's behavior.

- **Final State**:
  - `A` remains unchanged.
  - `idx_A` remains unchanged.
  - `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '>' character.
  - `idx_B` is a list of indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`, in reverse order.
  - `l` is the number of '>' characters in `s`.
  - `r` is 0.
  - The state is correctly described and matches the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative arrays and index lists ensures that the calculations are efficient and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The annotated code and the original assessment are both accurate.

Final: **True**
