Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when the pinball is placed on the last cell and the last cell is a '>'. According to the problem description, if the pinball is placed on the last cell and it is '>', it should move to the right and leave the grid immediately. However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
>>>
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
1 2 3
```
This is incorrect because the pinball placed on the last cell (3rd cell) should leave the grid immediately, taking 1 second, not 3 seconds.
