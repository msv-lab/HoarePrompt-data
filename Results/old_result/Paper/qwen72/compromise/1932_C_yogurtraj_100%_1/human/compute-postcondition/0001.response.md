Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers.** 

The values of `t` and `ii` remain unchanged. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`, respectively. Since `int(input())` must be greater than 0, both `n` and `m` are positive integers.
