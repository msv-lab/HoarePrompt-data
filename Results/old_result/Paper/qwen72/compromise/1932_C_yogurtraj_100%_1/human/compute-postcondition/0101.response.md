Output State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `i` is -1. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`, and `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `a[l] % m`.**
