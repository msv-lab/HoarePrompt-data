Output State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` (if the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`), `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l + 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, the character at index `i` in `t` is not 'R', and `k` is now `k * a[q1] % m`.**
