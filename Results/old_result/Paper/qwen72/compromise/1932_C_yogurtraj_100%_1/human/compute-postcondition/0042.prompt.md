Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated based on the condition: if `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q2] % m` where `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`; if `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is `k * a[q1] % m` where `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q1` is updated to `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if `t[i]` is not 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q2` is updated to `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is the updated value of `k` and the element at index `i` (which is `n - 2`) is now the updated value of `k`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R' and `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element and the element at index `n - 3` are the updated value of `k`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element and the element at index `n - 3` are the updated value of `k`, and all other elements are 0, except `y[i]` which is now `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 3`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is `q1 - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
