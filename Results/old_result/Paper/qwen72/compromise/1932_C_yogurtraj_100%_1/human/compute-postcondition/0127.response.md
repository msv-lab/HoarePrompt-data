To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: This is the input string.
2. **`ii`**: This is initialized to 0.
3. **`n`**: This is a positive integer.
4. **`m`**: This is a positive integer.
5. **`a`**: This is a list of integers provided by the input.
6. **`l`**: This is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`.
7. **`y`**: This is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of the loop's computation for that index.
8. **`i`**: This is initialized to -1.
9. **`q1`**: This is `l - n + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - n + 2` otherwise.
10. **`q2`**: This is `l + n - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' or `l + n` otherwise.
11. **`k`**: This is the final computed value after all iterations.

The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces. The key here is to understand the values of the elements in `y`.

Since the initial state mentions that `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of the loop's computation, we need to infer what these computations might be. However, the exact computation is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the values in terms of the loop's results.

Given the information:
- `y` is a list of `n` elements.
- Each element in `y` is the result of the loop's computation for that index.

The output will be the elements of `y` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of the elements in `y` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them as the results of the loop's computation.

Output: **[y[0], y[1], ..., y[n-1]] (where each y[i] is the result of the loop's computation for index i)**
