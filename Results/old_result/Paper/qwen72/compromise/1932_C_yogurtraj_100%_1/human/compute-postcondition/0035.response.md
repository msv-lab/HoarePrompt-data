The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0` in steps of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 4`, and `n` must remain a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R' and `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element and the element at index `n - 3` are the updated value of `k`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 4`**
