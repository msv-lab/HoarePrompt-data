### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and processes it.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because a special character must have a neighbor, and if it is the only special character, it cannot be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - **Even `n`:** The function constructs a string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` characters of the uppercase Latin alphabet twice. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, and the total number of special characters is `n`.
     - **Odd `n`:** The function starts with the string "AAA" and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` characters of the uppercase Latin alphabet twice. This ensures that the first three characters are special (since "A" is repeated three times), and the remaining characters are also special, making the total number of special characters `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if `n` is greater than 1.
   - The function prints "NO" if `n` is 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The function ensures that the constructed string has at most 200 characters, which is within the problem's constraints.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The function correctly identifies and handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - The function correctly constructs a string for even and odd `n` values, ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
