Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 5, `ans` is 'AA' + 'BB' + 'CC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'C') repeated twice to the existing value of `ans` (which is 'AABB'). Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
