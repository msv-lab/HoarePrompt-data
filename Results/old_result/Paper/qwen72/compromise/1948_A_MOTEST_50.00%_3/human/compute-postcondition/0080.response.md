Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `ans` is 'AABBCCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'C') twice to the string `ans`. The initial value of `ans` is 'AABBC', so after the execution, `ans` becomes 'AABBCCC'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
