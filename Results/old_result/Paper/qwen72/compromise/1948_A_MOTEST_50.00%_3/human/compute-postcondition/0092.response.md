Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and is at least 7 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` (which is 'D') twice to the string `ans`. The initial value of `ans` was 'AAABBBCC', so after executing the code, `ans` becomes 'AAABBBCCDD'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
