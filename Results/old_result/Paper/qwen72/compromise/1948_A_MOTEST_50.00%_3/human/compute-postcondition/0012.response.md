Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0, `j` is 0**

The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the variable `ans` by appending the character at index `x` of the string `s` twice. Since `x` is 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is 'A'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AA'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
