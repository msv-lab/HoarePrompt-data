Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and is at least 5 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAABBB', `x` is 1, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'B') twice to the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was 'AAA', so after the execution, `ans` becomes 'AAABBB'. The other variables remain unchanged.
