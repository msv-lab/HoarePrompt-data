Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1 and even, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1 and odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAABBCC...CC' (where 'C' is repeated `n // 2 - 1` times), and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.**
