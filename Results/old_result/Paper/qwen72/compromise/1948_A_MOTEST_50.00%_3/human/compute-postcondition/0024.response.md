Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, `ans` is 'ABBA', `x` is 1, `j` is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 'AAA'.
- The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` (which is 'B') twice to `ans`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes 'ABBA'.
- The values of `s`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
