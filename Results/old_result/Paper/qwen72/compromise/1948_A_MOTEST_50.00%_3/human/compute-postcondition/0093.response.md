Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and is at least 7 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 4, `j` is 2**

The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
