You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest sorted version of `s` depending on the initial order of `s`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be redefined in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will depend on the last input string `s`. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). It processes each test case and returns the results based on the input string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
