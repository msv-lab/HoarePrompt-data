Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case using the `func_1` function.

1. **Check for Uniform Array**:
   - The function first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make a uniform array non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Find Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
   - If the array is not uniform, the function then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in the array. This is intended to be the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`**:
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element is flawed. It only considers the first element and does not account for other elements that might also form consecutive sequences. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling of Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program should consider all possible consecutive sequences of the same element, not just those that match the first element. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should consider the sequence of `2`s, not just the `1`s.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output `2` instead of `1`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
