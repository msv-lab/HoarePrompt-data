Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplying by the total count of other sticks.

4. **Summing Up the Results**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting combinations is correct. For a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Since the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks are of the same length or two sticks are of the same length and the third stick is shorter.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by counting the combinations of sticks of the same length and the combinations of two sticks of the same length with one stick of a different length.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks or where no valid triangles can be formed.

Given the above points, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
