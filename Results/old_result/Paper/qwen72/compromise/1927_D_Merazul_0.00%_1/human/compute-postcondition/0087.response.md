The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of integers in the array, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `queries`: A list of `q` queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function returns the results of the queries for each test case. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the output, but it is implied that the function processes the queries and returns some form of result based on the subarrays defined by the queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it processes a subarray defined by the query and returns the results of these queries for each test case.**
