Let's break down the print statement and the variables involved based on the initial state provided:

1. **`f`**: This variable is `1` if for every integer `i` from 1 to `k`, at least one of `i` is in `a` or `i` is in `b`. Otherwise, `f` is `0`.
2. **`m`**: This is calculated as `k // 2 - (number of elements in `a` that are not in `b`)`.
3. **`n`**: This is calculated as `k // 2 - (number of elements in `b` that are not in `a`)`.
4. **`i`**: This is `k`.
5. **`u`**: This is `True` if `k` is in `a`, otherwise `False`.
6. **`v`**: This is `True` if `k` is in `b`, otherwise `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`f ^ 1`**:
   - This is a bitwise XOR operation between `f` and `1`.
   - If `f` is `1`, then `f ^ 1` is `0`.
   - If `f` is `0`, then `f ^ 1` is `1`.

2. **`m | n < 0`**:
   - This is a bitwise OR operation between `m` and `n`, followed by a comparison with `0`.
   - If `m | n` is less than `0`, the result is `True`.
   - If `m | n` is not less than `0`, the result is `False`.

3. **`f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`**:
   - This is a logical OR operation between the results of `f ^ 1` and `m | n < 0`.
   - If `f ^ 1` is `0` and `m | n < 0` is `False`, the result is `False`.
   - If `f ^ 1` is `0` and `m | n < 0` is `True`, the result is `True`.
   - If `f ^ 1` is `1` and `m | n < 0` is `False`, the result is `True`.
   - If `f ^ 1` is `1` and `m | n < 0` is `True`, the result is `True`.

4. **Slicing the String 'YNEOS'**:
   - The string 'YNEOS' is indexed as follows: `Y` at index 0, `N` at index 1, `E` at index 2, `O` at index 3, `S` at index 4.
   - The slicing operation `::2` means starting from the index given by the condition and taking every second character.
   - If the condition is `False`, the slicing starts from index 0: `'YNEOS'[0::2]` which is `'YEO'`.
   - If the condition is `True`, the slicing starts from index 1: `'YNEOS'[1::2]` which is `'NOS'`.

### Final Output Determination:

- **If `f` is `1`**:
  - `f ^ 1` is `0`.
  - The condition `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` is `False` if `m | n` is not less than `0`.
  - The condition `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` is `True` if `m | n` is less than `0`.
  - Therefore, the output will be:
    - `'YEO'` if `m | n` is not less than `0`.
    - `'NOS'` if `m | n` is less than `0`.

- **If `f` is `0`**:
  - `f ^ 1` is `1`.
  - The condition `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` is always `True` regardless of the value of `m | n`.
  - Therefore, the output will always be:
    - `'NOS'`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the initial state and the logical operations, the print statement will output:
- `'YEO'` if `f` is `1` and `m | n` is not less than `0`.
- `'NOS'` in all other cases.

Since the exact values of `m` and `n` are not provided, we can only determine the output based on the value of `f` and the condition `m | n < 0`.

Output: **'YEO' if `f` is `1` and `m | n` is not less than `0`; otherwise 'NOS'**.
