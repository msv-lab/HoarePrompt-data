Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\), or reporting that no such pair exists. However, the provided program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and bitwise logic, which does not align with the requirements of the given problem.

Here are the key issues with the provided program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program uses a lambda function `R` to parse input, but it does not correctly handle the input format. The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array and multiple queries. The program does not correctly parse and process these inputs.

2. **Logic for Finding Indices**: The program does not implement any logic to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within the specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). Instead, it performs set operations and bitwise logic that do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YNEOS' based on some bitwise operations, which is not the correct output format. The problem requires outputting two indices or \(-1 -1\) if no such pair exists.

A correct implementation would involve parsing the input correctly, processing each query to find the required indices, and outputting the results in the specified format. Here is a more appropriate solution:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        q = int(input())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input().split())
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        print(i+1, j+1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

solve()
```

This solution correctly parses the input, processes each query to find the required indices, and outputs the results in the specified format.
