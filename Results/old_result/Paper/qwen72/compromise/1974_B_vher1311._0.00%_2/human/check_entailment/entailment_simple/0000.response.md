### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Algorithm:**
   - The encoding process constructs a string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We should first construct the string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Then, we replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from `b` and initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of this list, respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in `b`:
     - If the character is in the list of unique characters, it replaces the character with the character at the end of the list and decrements the end pointer `j`.
     - If the character is not in the list, it inserts the character at the current position `i` in the list and increments both `i` and `j`.
   - Finally, it returns a string of the unique characters, which is incorrect for the decoding process.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly decode the string. Instead, it modifies the input string `s` by replacing all characters with the last unique character in `unique_chars` and then returns a string of unique characters.
   - The logic for handling characters not in `unique_chars` is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process.
   - The function should replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r` to correctly decode the string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem. It fails to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters, and instead returns a string of unique characters. This does not restore the original string `s`.
