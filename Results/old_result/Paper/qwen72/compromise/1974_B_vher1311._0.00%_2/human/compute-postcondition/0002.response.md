The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is non-empty (i.e., its length is at least 1), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `unique_chars` minus 1, but these variables are not used in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The variable `char` will take the value of the first character in `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the first character in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `unique_chars` minus 1**
