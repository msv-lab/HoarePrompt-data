Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Type Conversion**: The elements of `aa` and `bb` are converted to strings, but they should be integers. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and counts.
   ```python
   aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
   bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
   ```

2. **Sliding Window Logic**: The logic for updating the sliding window is flawed. Specifically, the way the program updates the counts of elements in `D`, `E`, and `C` is not correct. The program should correctly handle the addition and removal of elements from the current window.

3. **Initialization of `E` and `C`**: The initialization of `E` and `C` is done incorrectly. `E` should be initialized as the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, and `C` should be initialized as the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.

4. **Sliding Window Update**: The update logic for the sliding window is complex and prone to errors. The program should correctly handle the removal of the element that is sliding out of the window and the addition of the new element that is sliding into the window.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for i in range(m, n):
            in_aa = aa[i]
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            
            # Remove the element that is sliding out of the window
            if out_aa in D:
                if D[out_aa] > 0:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                else:
                    cnt_aa[out_aa] -= 1
            
            # Add the element that is sliding into the window
            if in_aa in cnt_bb:
                if in_aa in D:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
                    pairs_in_D += 1
                elif in_aa in cnt_aa:
                    D[in_aa] = 1
                    pairs_in_D += 1
                else:
                    cnt_aa[in_aa] = 1
            
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the elements are treated as integers, and the sliding window logic is correctly implemented to update the counts of elements in the current window.
