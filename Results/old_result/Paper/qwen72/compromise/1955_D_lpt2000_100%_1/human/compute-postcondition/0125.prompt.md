Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the user input, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from the user input split by spaces, `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from the user input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other initial conditions remain valid: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from user input, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is initially 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, the frequency of `out_aa` in `D` is either decreased by 1 (if `E[out_aa]` is 0) or remains unchanged (if `E[out_aa] > 0`), and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other initial conditions remain valid: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from user input, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `bb` is a new list of strings where each element is a string from user input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection (minimum counts) of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. The next `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and the next `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `m < n`, `n - m > 0`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`) remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
