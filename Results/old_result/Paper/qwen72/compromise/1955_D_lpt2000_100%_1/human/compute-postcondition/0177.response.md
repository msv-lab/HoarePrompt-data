Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (before any changes) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The next pair `(in_aa, out_aa)` will be the next elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively. If `E[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and the value of `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.***
