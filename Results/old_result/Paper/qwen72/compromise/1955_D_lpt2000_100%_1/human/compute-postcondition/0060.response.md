Postcondition: ***`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. All other variables (`nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `E`, `C`, `D`) retain their previous values.***
