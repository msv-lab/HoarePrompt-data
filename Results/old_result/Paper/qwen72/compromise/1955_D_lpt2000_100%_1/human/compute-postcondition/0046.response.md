Postcondition: ***`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of strings derived from the new input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with values being the minimum counts of common elements, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with their respective frequencies, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` was initially greater than or equal to `k` and 2 if `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains 0, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the count of `in_aa` in `E` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.***
