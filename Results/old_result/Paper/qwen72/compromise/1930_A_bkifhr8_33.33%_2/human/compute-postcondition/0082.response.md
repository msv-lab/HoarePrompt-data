Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst` added to the original value of `ans` if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is an empty list. If the length of `lst` is 2, the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
