Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `l` is an input string. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`, and the first two elements of `lst` are removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is set to the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2`, `lst` is a list with one less element, and the first element of `lst` is now the second element from the initial state, with the third element from the initial state removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `l` is an input string. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and `lst` is a list with two elements removed: the first element is now the second element from the initial state, and the third element from the initial state is also removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
