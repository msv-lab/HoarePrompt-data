The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst` before the removal, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` using a space as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` is reduced by 1. The element at index 2 has been removed from `lst`.**
