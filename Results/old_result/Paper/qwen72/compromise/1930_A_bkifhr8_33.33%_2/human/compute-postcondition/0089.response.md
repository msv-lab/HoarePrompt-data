Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `len(lst)` is not equal to 2, `lst` is now an empty list. If `len(lst)` is 2, `lst` remains a list of 2 integers.***
