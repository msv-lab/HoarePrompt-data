Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2n + 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is 0, the length of `lst` is the number of substrings in `l` separated by spaces, `l` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which was 0) plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. The length of `lst` is the number of substrings in `l` separated by spaces minus 1 if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise the length of `lst` is 2. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the second element (index 1) of `lst` has been removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst` added to the original value of `ans` if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` is an empty list. If the length of `lst` is 2, the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `len(lst)` is not equal to 2, `lst` is now an empty list. If `len(lst)` is 2, `lst` remains a list of 2 integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
