Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `lst`, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list with two elements removed: the first element is now the second element from the initial state, and the third element from the initial state is also removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the third element from the list `lst`.
- The initial state already indicates that the first element of `lst` is now the second element from the initial state, and the third element from the initial state is removed.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `lst` has two elements removed: the first element (now the second from the initial state) and the third element from the initial state.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
