Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is updated to `ans_f` plus the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst`, the length of `lst` is reduced by 1 with the element at index 2 removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since 1 * 2 = 2) from the list `lst`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `ans_f` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` was previously updated to `ans_f` plus the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst`.
- The length of `lst` is now reduced by 1, as the element at index 2 has been removed.
