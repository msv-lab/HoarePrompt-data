Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which was 0) plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. The length of `lst` is the number of substrings in `l` separated by spaces minus 1 if the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, otherwise the length of `lst` is 2. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, the second element (index 1) of `lst` has been removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
