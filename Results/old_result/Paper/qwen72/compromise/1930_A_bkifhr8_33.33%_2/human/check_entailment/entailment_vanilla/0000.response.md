### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Processing the List:**
   - The program attempts to iterate over the list and select pairs of integers to add their minimum value to the score.
   - However, the way it removes elements from the list is incorrect. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are not removing the correct elements. The indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, which will lead to incorrect removals and potential index errors.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always select the smallest two numbers from the list and add the smaller of the two to the score.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the list and then iterating over the sorted list, adding the first `n` elements to the score (since the first `n` elements will be the smallest `n` pairs).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The program should sort the list of integers and then sum the first `n` elements to get the maximum score.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - `t = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n = int(input())` reads the number of pairs.
  - `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads the list of integers and converts them to a list of integers.

- **Sorting and Summing:**
  - `lst.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order.
  - `ans = sum(lst[:n])` sums the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest `n` pairs.

- **Output:**
  - `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the score for the current test case to the results list.
  - After processing all test cases, the program prints each score in the results list.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed method of removing elements from the list. The corrected program follows the optimal strategy and is correct.

Correctness: **False**
