Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Loop Condition and Indexing**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is incorrect because it iterates `2n` times, but you only need to perform `n` moves.
   - The indexing and removal logic within the loop is flawed. Specifically, `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The `remove` method removes the first occurrence of the specified value, not the element at the specified index. This can lead to incorrect removals and incorrect scores.

2. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum of the first two elements in the list and then removes them. However, it does not ensure that the smallest elements are always paired optimally to maximize the score.

3. **Optimal Pairing**:
   - To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest elements together. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements in a sorted list of `2n` elements will be the smallest).

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The score is calculated by summing the first `n` elements of the sorted list. This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the score.

4. **Storing and Printing Results**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `ans_f` and printed at the end.

This solution correctly handles the problem and ensures the maximum possible score is achieved for each test case.
