Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, Bob cannot sell more buns than he has.
   - If `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would start to be less than the usual price `a`, which is not beneficial.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would be less or equal to the usual price. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - The sum of the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

The logic and calculations are correct, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
