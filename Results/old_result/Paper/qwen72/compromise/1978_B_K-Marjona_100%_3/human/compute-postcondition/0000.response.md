To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

The state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for the loop. The input value must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and the input value for the loop must be a positive integer**.
