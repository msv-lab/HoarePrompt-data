Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, the length of `nums` is 21, `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, and the value of `nums[i]` (which is \(2^0 = 1\)) is greater than `k`.** 

The value of `idx` is now -1, which is the result of `i - 1` where `i` was 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
