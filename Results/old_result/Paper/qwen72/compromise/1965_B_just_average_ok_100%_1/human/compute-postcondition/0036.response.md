Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 1, `len(nums)` is 21. If `nums[1]` (which is \(2^1\)) is greater than `k`, then `idx` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `idx`.***
