To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the changes made to the list `nums`.

### Initial State:
- `nums` is the original list.
- New elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are appended to `nums`.
- The value `2^idx` is removed from `nums`.
- `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Original Length of `nums`:**
   - Let the original length of `nums` be `n`.

2. **Appending New Elements:**
   - Three new elements are appended to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - This increases the length of `nums` by 3.

3. **Removing an Element:**
   - The value `2^idx` is removed from `nums`.
   - This decreases the length of `nums` by 1.

4. **Net Change in Length:**
   - The net change in the length of `nums` is \(3 - 1 = 2\).

5. **Final Length of `nums`:**
   - The final length of `nums` is \(n + 2\).

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the final length of the list `nums`, which is the original length plus 2.

Output: **n + 2 (where n is the original length of the list `nums`)**
