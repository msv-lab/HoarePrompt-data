Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the list `nums` will contain the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the values \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\). The variable `idx` will be the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`. The variable `i` will be the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists. The length of `nums` will be 23. The values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the input values for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`nums` List**: Initially, `nums` contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). After each iteration, the list is modified by appending three new elements: \(k - \text{nums}[\text{idx}]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[\text{idx}] + 1\), and removing the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\). This process ensures that the length of `nums` remains 23 after each iteration.
- **`idx` Variable**: `idx` is determined by finding the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`. This value is used to modify the `nums` list.
- **`i` Variable**: `i` is the index where `nums[i] > k` or 20 if no such element exists. This is used to find the position of the element greater than `k`.
- **`n` and `k` Variables**: These variables are updated to the input values for each iteration of the loop, meaning they will reflect the values provided in the input for each test case.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, the modifications to `nums` are consistent, and the final state of `nums` after all iterations will be as described above.
