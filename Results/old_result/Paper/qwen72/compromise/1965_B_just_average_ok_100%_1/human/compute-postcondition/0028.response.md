To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's ability to run, specifically the variables or objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `nums`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(len(nums))` function, which means it will start at 0 and iterate up to `len(nums) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `nums` must be a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which means it has 21 elements (from 0 to 20 inclusive).

Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `nums` is not empty, which it isn't based on the given state. However, the state of `i` and the length of `nums` are the critical factors here.

State: **`nums` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 0, `len(nums)` is 21**
