The code snippet `nums.append(k - nums[idx])` appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `nums[i]` (where `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` greater than `k`) is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to `i - 1` and the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `idx` remains -1 after the loop completes all iterations.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. If `idx` is set to `i - 1` (where `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` greater than `k`), then `nums[idx]` is the element just before the first element greater than `k`.
2. The value `k - nums[idx]` is calculated and appended to the list `nums`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nums` now includes the new element `k - nums[idx]` at the end of the list.
- `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).

Output State: **`nums` is the original list with the new element `k - nums[idx]` appended to it, and `idx` remains the same as it was before the code execution (either `i - 1` or -1).**
