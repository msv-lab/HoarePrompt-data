Output State: **If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` remains -1, and `i` is 20. If an element in `nums` is greater than `k`, `idx` is set to the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the index of the first element greater than `k`. The length of `nums` is now 23, and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The last element in `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The element `1 << idx` has been removed from `nums`.**
