The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. For each test case, it determines the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements from `b`. The function prints the count of such subarrays for each test case. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed, and the counts have been printed.
