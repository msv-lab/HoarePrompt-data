Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with any elements that were in `a` removed if they were present, `done` is a set containing the values `n`, `m`, and `k` if they were in `todo` and removed from it, `extra` is a set containing any values from `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`. If `old` (the value of `a[r - m]` where `r` is an unknown integer) is in `extra`, `old` has been removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
