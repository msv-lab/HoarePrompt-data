Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `extra` is a set, `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `old = a[r - m]` updates the value of `old` to `a[1]` because `r` is `m + 1`, and `r - m` evaluates to `1`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `r`, `j`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the conditions for `ans` are still valid.
