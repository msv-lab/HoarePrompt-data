Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `a[1]` (which is `m`) is in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing the values `a[0]` (which is `n`) and `a[1]` (which is `m`), and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`). If `a[1]` is not in `todo`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[0]` removed if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing the value `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo` or an empty set otherwise, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]` which is `n`) and the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]` which is `m`).**
