Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` is a set with `a[1]` removed and `a[r]` added. If `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `todo` also contains `a[1]` and `done` is the set `done` with the element `a[1]` removed. `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
