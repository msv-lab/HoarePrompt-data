Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m`, `m` must be less than `n`, `old` is removed from the list `extra`.** 

The value of `old` is no longer in the list `extra`, but all other variables (`n`, `m`, and `r`) remain unchanged. The condition that `m` must be less than `n` is still valid.
