Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, `j` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` and any other elements it previously had, and `extra` remains an empty set. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `a[j]` is no longer in `todo` if it was initially in `todo`, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, `done` remains an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing the integers `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`.**
