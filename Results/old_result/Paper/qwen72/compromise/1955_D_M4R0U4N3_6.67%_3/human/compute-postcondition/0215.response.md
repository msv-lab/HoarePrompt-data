To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `r` is set to `n`.
   - `old` is set to `a[n - m]`.
   - `j` is set to `m - 1`.
   - `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed.
   - `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations.
   - `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations.
   - `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers, and its exact values are not specified.
   - `n` and `m` are integers where `n >= m` and `m >= 1`.
   - `r` is initialized to `n`.
   - `old` is the element at index `n - m` in the list `a`.
   - `j` is initialized to `m - 1`.
   - `todo` is a set of integers from user input, but elements that are in `a` are removed.
   - `done` is a set of elements from `a` that were in `todo` during the loop iterations.
   - `extra` is a set of elements from `a` that were not in `todo` during the loop iterations.
   - `ans` is the count of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop likely iterates through the list `a` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` based on the elements in `a` and the user input.
   - The condition `len(done) >= k` is checked during each iteration, and if true, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`, which is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

Since the exact values of `a`, `k`, and the user input are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of times the length of `done` met or exceeded `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the length of done was greater than or equal to k during the loop iterations)**
