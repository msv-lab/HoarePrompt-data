Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` remains unchanged unless elements are removed from `a` during the loop iterations, `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body, `extra` and `done` are updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part, `done` no longer contains `a[m]`.**
