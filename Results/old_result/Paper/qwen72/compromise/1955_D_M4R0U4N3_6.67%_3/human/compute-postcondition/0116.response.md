The only objects in the loop head are variables `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is `m`, `m` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer greater than `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `r` needs to be incremented by 1, so `r` is `m + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `r` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is `a[0]`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `ans`, `done`, `todo`, or `extra`.**
