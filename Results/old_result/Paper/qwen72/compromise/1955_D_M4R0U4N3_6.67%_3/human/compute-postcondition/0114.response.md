The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we can only state that `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[0]`, `ans` is increased by 1, if `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `done` and is not added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. The length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
