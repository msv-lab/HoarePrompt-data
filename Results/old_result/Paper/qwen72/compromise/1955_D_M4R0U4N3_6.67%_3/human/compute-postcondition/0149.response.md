Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of three input integers, `r` is `n`, `old` is `a[n - m]`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by the number of times this condition was true during the loop execution, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input provided by `input().split()`, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `extra = set()` initializes `extra` as an empty set.
- The initial state mentions that `extra` contains integers from the input list `a` that were in the initial `m` elements or were added to `extra` during the loop execution but were not added to `done`. However, since the code snippet only initializes `extra` and does not add any elements to it, `extra` remains an empty set.
- The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `old`, `todo`, `done`, and `ans`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
