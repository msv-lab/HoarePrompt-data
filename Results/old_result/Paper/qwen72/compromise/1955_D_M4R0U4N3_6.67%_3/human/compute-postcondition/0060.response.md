Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `r + 1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `j` is 2, `r` is `r + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, and `old` has been removed from the list `done`.** 

The value of `old` is `a[r - m]`, and it has been removed from the list `done`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
