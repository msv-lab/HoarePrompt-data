Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing any values from the new `a` that were not in `todo` and therefore not moved to `done`, plus any other elements from the new `a` that were not in `todo` and added to `extra` during the loop, `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition.**

The `done` set is now empty, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
