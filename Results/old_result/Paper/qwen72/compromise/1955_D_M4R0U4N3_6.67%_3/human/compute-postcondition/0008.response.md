Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, `todo` is a set of integers provided by the user input with the value `a[j]` removed, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0.**

The value of `a[j]` (which is `a[0]` since `j` is 0) is removed from the set `todo`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
