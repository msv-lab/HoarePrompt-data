Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[m]`, `j` is `m - 1`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the input provided by `input().split()` but with all elements that were in `a` during the loop iterations removed, `ans` remains unchanged unless `len(done) >= k` in the loop body, `extra` is the set `extra` with `a[m]` removed, `done` is updated based on the conditions involving `old` and `a[r]` as described in the if part.**
