Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `j` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `todo` is a set of integers from the new input, `done` is a set, `extra` is a set containing `a[1]`, and `ans` is the number of iterations where `len(done) >= k` or `len(done) < k` depending on the condition.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[j]` is added to the set `extra`.
- Since `j` is 1, `a[1]` is added to `extra`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
