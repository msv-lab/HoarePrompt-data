The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be incremented from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The array `a` and its elements are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
