You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to be part of a larger program or script that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element `a_i` in the array is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should be called within a loop or similar construct that iterates over the test cases, each of which is defined by the integer `n` and the array `a`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, processing each test case defined by the integer `m` and the array `arr`. For each test case, the loop checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the final output state is the sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an integer array `a` of length `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). It returns a result for each test case based on the provided array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
