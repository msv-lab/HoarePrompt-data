You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and an array `arr` of `m` integers. It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final output is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program only splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted, but it does not properly insert the digits back into the array in the correct position. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted to achieve a sorted array.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the first test case:
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and check if `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is sorted, which it is.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `45` needs to be split into `[4, 5]` and the array should become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

For the second test case:
- The array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
- The program will split `28` into `[2, 8]` and check if `[12, 2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `12` needs to be split into `[1, 2]` and the array should become `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

For the third test case:
- The array is `[0, 0]`.
- The array is already sorted, so the program will correctly print `YES`.

The program fails to handle the transformation of elements correctly and does not ensure that the array is sorted after all necessary operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
