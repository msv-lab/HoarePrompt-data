You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and an array `arr` of `m` integers. It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final output is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `m` which represents the length of the array.
   - It then reads `m` integers and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function assumes that it is possible to sort the array (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal:**
   - The function traverses the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.

4. **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
  - The function splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` and does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits and then checking the entire array for sorted order.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - **First Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
    - The array is sorted, so the output should be `YES`.
  - **Second Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 28, 5]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
    - The array is not sorted, so the output should be `NO`.
  - **Third Test Case:**
    - Array: `[0, 0]`
    - The array is already sorted, so the output should be `YES`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting check for the entire array. It only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
