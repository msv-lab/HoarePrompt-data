Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation any number of times. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` and then checks if the resulting list of digits plus the next element `arr[i]` is sorted. This approach is incorrect because the operation should split the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and then insert those digits in the same position, not just the first digit.

2. **Multiple Operations**: The problem allows for the operation to be performed any number of times, but the program only checks for a single operation. This means it may miss cases where multiple operations are needed to make the array non-decreasing.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by only considering the immediate next element after splitting. This is not sufficient to ensure the entire array is non-decreasing.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Split any element that is at least 10 into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- Check if the resulting array is non-decreasing after performing the operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    # Function to split an element into its digits and insert them in the same position
    def split_element(i):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
        arr[i:i+1] = digits

    # Perform the operation on all elements that are at least 10
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= 10:
            split_element(i)

    # Check if the resulting array is non-decreasing
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

Explanation:
- The `can_be_sorted` function first defines a helper function `split_element` to split an element into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- It then iterates over the array and splits any element that is at least 10.
- Finally, it checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the issues with the original program, the correctness of the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
