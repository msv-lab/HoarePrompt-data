#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to be part of a larger program or script that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element `a_i` in the array is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should be called within a loop or similar construct that iterates over the test cases, each of which is defined by the integer `n` and the array `a`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, processing each test case defined by the integer `m` and the array `arr`. For each test case, the loop checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the final output state is the sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and an array `arr` of `m` integers. It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final output is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
