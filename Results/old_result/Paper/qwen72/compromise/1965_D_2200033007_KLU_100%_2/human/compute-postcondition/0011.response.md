The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList` and `smallList`. Both `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, with the constraint that the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element. The function returns the last element of `bigList` if it does not match the last element of `smallList`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, both lists of integers where `bigList` is at least as long as `smallList` and both contain at least one element. It returns the last element of `bigList` if it does not match the last element of `smallList`.**
