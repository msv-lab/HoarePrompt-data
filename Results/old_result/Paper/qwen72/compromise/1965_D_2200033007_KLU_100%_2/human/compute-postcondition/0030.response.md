Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `sm` is `a[2]`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements from index `i` to `len(a) - 1` and the value `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the value of `sm` (which is `a[2]`) to the list `cts`.
- The initial state specifies that `cts` already contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements from index `i` to `len(a) - 1`.
- After appending `sm` to `cts`, the new state reflects that `cts` now includes this additional value.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, `sm`) remain unchanged.
