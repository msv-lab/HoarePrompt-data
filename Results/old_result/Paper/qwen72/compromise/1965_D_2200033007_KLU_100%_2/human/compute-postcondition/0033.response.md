Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is `a[2] + a[3]`, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements from index `i` to `len(a) - 1`, the value `a[2]`, and the value `a[2] + a[3]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sm` (which is `a[2] + a[3]`) to the list `cts`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged. The updated `cts` now includes the additional element `a[2] + a[3]`.
