Output State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the length of `bigList` is greater than or equal to the length of `smallList`, and both lists contain at least one element, but the last element of `bigList` is no longer equal to the last element of `smallList` (if any remains). The lengths of both `bigList` and `smallList` are reduced such that the remaining elements do not match at the end.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the loop condition `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is no longer satisfied. This means that either `smallList` is empty, or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal. The lengths of both lists are reduced by the number of matching elements from the end of each list.
