Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome array with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is `a[2] + a[3]`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements from index `i` to `len(a) - 1` and the value `a[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to be the sum of `a[2]` and `a[3]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, and `cts`) remain unchanged.
