Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how each function contributes to the solution:

1. **func_1**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted. This is used to generate the complete set of subarray sums for a candidate solution.

2. **func_2**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times. Since the input is missing exactly one subarray sum, this function helps identify the missing sum by finding the sum that appears an odd number of times.

3. **func_3**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using the identified unique subarray sums. It places the values in the middle and then distributes the remaining values symmetrically to ensure the array is a palindrome.

4. **func_4**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a utility function to find the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`. However, it is not necessary for the core logic of the problem.

The overall approach of the program is sound:
- It correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.
- It reconstructs the palindrome array by placing the values symmetrically.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
