Reasoning:  
The program aims to reconstruct a palindromic array from the given sums of all but one of its subarrays. The approach taken involves identifying the missing subarray sum and using it to reconstruct the original palindromic array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic and functions:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the size of the array `n` and the list of subarray sums.
   - Sorts the subarray sums to facilitate further processing.

2. **Identifying the Missing Sum**:
   - Uses `func_2` to filter out duplicate sums, leaving a list of unique sums (`odds`).
   - Determines the missing sum based on the parity of the sums and the length of the array. This is done by checking the number of unique sums and comparing them to the expected number of unique sums for a palindromic array of length `n`.

3. **Reconstructing the Palindromic Array**:
   - Uses `func_3` to construct the palindromic array from the unique sums and the missing sum.
   - `func_1` generates all subarray sums for a given array.
   - `func_4` helps in identifying the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

4. **Function Details**:
   - **func_1**: Generates all subarray sums for a given array and returns them sorted.
   - **func_2**: Filters out duplicate sums, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in the resulting list are equal.
   - **func_3**: Reconstructs the palindromic array from the unique sums and the missing sum.
   - **func_4**: Identifies the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given subarray sums.

The logic and steps seem to align well with the problem requirements. The program correctly handles the reconstruction of the palindromic array and identifies the missing subarray sum. The use of sorting and filtering ensures that the unique sums are processed correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the program appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given inputs.
