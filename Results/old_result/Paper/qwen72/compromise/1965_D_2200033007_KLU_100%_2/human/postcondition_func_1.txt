The function `func_2` takes a list `cts` of integers as input and returns a new list `odds`. This list `odds` contains only those integers from `cts` that do not appear consecutively. Specifically, any integer in `cts` that is the same as the last added integer in `odds` is skipped, ensuring that no two consecutive elements in the returned list `odds` are equal.
