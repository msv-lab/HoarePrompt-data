The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
