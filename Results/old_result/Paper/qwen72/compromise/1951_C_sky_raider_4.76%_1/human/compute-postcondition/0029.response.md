Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is `k - n * min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is the first element of the list `l`.
- `s` is `min(m, k)`.
- The new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * min(m, k) - min(m, k) * min(m, k) / 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
