Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 0, `l[i]` is `l[0]`.
- The new value of `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `l`) remain unchanged.
