The value of `c` is calculated as `k * k / 2`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is equal to `k * k / 2`.**
