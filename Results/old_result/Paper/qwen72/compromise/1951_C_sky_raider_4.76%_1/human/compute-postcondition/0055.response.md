Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the new input integer, `k` is now `k - s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is now `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s + l[1] * s - s * s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the minimum of `m` and the original `k`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - s`.
- The value of `c` remains the same as it was defined in the initial state, which is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s + l[1] * s - s * s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
