Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 100`, and a list of `n` integers, each between `1` and `10^9`. The function sorts each list of integers in ascending order and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. After executing `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
