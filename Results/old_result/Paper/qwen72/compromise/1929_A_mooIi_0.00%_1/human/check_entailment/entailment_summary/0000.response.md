Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The program, however, simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then computing the sum of the differences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Array**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the array in descending order to maximize the differences.
4. **Calculating Beauty**: It calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
5. **Output**: It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
