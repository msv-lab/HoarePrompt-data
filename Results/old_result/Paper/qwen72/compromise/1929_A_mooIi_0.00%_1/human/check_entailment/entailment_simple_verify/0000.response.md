Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the required output. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. 

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order, and then the sum of the differences should be calculated. The current program does not perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array in ascending order. This is a clear mismatch with the problem requirements.

For the given example:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output `1 2 3`. The correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order to get `[3, 2, 1]` and then calculate the beauty as `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
