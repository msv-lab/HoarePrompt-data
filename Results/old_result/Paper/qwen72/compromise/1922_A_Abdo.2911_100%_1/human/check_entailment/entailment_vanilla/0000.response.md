### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It then iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` to check if a template can be formed such that `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.

3. **Conditions for Template Matching:**
   - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same).
     - The function checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If it is, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.
   - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `b[i]`.
     - The function checks if `c[i]` is the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If it is, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - If `possible` remains `False`, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - The function correctly checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), which ensures that `c` does not match the template.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
  - The function correctly checks if `c[i]` is the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is different from both, then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different.
  - It also handles the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is different from both.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. The conditions and checks are correctly applied, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**
