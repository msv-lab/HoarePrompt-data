Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `possible` is set to True, indicating that either:
  - There exists at least one character in `a` that is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different, or
  - There exists at least one character in `a` that is not equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to either `a` or `b`.

Given that `possible` is set to True, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
