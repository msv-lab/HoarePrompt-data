Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is True/False (unchanged)**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = input().strip()` updates the value of `a` to a new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.
