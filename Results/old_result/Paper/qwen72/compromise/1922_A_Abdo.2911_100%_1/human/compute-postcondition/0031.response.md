Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is set to True.** 

The value of `possible` has been explicitly set to True, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
