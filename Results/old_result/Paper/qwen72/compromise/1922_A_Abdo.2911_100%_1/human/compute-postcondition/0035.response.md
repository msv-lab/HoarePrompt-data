Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2, `possible` is True.**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 2, and `possible` is set to True or False based on the conditions described in the task.
- The code snippet sets `possible` to True.
- Therefore, the value of `possible` is now True.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects these values, with `possible` now explicitly set to True.
