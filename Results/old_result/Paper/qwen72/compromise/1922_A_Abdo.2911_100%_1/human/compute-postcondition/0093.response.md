Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is True/False (unchanged)**

The code snippet `c = input().strip()` updates the value of `c` to the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `possible`) remain unchanged.
