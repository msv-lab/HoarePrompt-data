Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- `possible` is True, which means that the conditions for `possible` being True are satisfied. These conditions are:
  - Either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or
  - `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`.

Given that `possible` is True, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
