The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It checks if there is any index `i` where the character in `c` is different from the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` when `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If such a condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer, and `a`, `b`, and `c` being the last input strings with leading and trailing spaces removed. The variable `i` is set to `n-1` and `possible` is either True or False based on the conditions checked.
