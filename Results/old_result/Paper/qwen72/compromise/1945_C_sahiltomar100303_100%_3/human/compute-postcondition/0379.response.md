Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `i` is `n - 1`
- `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than `mid`
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` is 0
- `right` is `n`
- `leftZero` is 0
- `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`
- `rightZero` is 0
- `rightOne` is 0
- The current value of `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(left)
```

From the initial state, we can see that `left` is explicitly defined as 0. Therefore, the value of `left` is 0.

Output: **0**
