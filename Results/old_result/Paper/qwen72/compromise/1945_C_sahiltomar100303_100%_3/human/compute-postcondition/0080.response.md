Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is `tleftZero + tleftOne`, `rightOne` is `trightZero + trightOne`.**

### Explanation:
- **`left`**: After all iterations, `left` will be 0 because the loop decrements `left` by 1 each time until it is no longer greater than 0.
- **`leftZero` and `leftOne`**: These variables are decremented each time a '0' or '1' is moved from the left half to the right half of the string. By the end of the loop, all '0's and '1's from the left half will have been moved, so both `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be 0.
- **`rightZero` and `rightOne`**: These variables are incremented each time a '0' or '1' is moved from the left half to the right half. By the end of the loop, all '0's and '1's from the left half will have been moved to the right half, so `rightZero` will be the sum of `tleftZero` and `tleftOne`, and `rightOne` will be the sum of `trightZero` and `trightOne`.
- **Other variables**: The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `leftMove` also remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
