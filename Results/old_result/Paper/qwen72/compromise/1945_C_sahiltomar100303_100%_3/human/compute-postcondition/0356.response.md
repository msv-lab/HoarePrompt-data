Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `trightZero`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1`, `right` is `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'.** 

The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1, updating the value of `rightOne` to `trightOne - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
