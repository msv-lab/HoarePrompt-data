Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, `rightZero` is 0, and `rightOne` is 0. If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` retains its value. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.***
