Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `trightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2. If `left` is greater than 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `left` remains greater than 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, and the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.**
