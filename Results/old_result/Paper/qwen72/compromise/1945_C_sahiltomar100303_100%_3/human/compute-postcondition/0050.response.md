Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 3, and `rightOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 1, and `rightOne` is 2 and `trightOne` is 2.**
