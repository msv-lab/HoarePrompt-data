The value of `right` is incremented by 1, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `right` is `n // 2 + 1`, so after the increment, `right` becomes `n // 2 + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `n // 2 + 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`. If the character at index `right - 1` in the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is `trightZero - 1` and `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1`. Otherwise, `rightZero` is `trightZero` and `rightOne` is `trightOne - 2`.**
