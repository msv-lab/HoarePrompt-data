Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of the new `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of the new `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of the new `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of the new `s`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. If `left` is greater than 0, it remains greater than 0, and `right` remains `n`. If `left` is 0, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is either less than or equal to or greater than the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - left)`.**
