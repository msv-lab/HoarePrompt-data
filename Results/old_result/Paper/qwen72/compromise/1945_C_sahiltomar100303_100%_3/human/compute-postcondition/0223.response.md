Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the second half, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the second half, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**
