The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `rightOne` was 1 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` was not '0', and 0 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` was '0'. Therefore, the new value of `rightOne` will be 2 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` was not '0', and 1 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` was '0'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 2 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is 1 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` and `rightZero` are 0, `trightOne` is 1 if the character at position `mid + 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is 0.**
