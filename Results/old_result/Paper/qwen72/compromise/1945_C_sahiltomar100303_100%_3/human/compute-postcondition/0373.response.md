Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `right` is less than `n` and either `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks the character at the current `right` index in the string `s`:
  - If the character is '0', it increments `tleftZero` and decrements `trightZero`.
  - If the character is '1', it increments `tleftOne` and decrements `trightOne`.
- The `right` index is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- After all iterations, the loop will have processed all characters from `n // 2` to `n - 1` (inclusive).
- The final state of the variables will be:
  - `right` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters up to the end of the string.
  - `leftZero` will remain 0 because it is not updated in the loop.
  - `leftOne` will be equal to `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, as `tleftOne` is incremented for each '1' encountered from `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
  - `rightZero` will be 0 because all '0's have been moved to the left side.
  - `rightOne` will be 0 because all '1's have been moved to the left side.
