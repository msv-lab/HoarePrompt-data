Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the second half, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the second half, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftOne` is `leftOne`.**

The value of `trightOne` has been decremented by 1, so `tleftOne` is now equal to `leftOne`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
