Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, and `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n`, indicating the loop has completed.
- The variables `rightZero` and `trightZero` both count the total number of '0's in the second half of the string `s`.
- The variables `rightOne` and `trightOne` both count the total number of '1's in the second half of the string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftMove`, `tleftZero`, `leftZero`, `tleftOne`, `leftOne`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
