Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1, and `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, while `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` (plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0'), `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` (and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0'), `leftZero` is `tleftZero - 1` if `s[left - 1]` was '0', otherwise `leftOne` is `tleftOne - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` (plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0'), `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 3` and must be greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0'. If `s[left - 1]` was '0', `leftZero` is `tleftZero - 2` and `rightZero` is `trightZero + 1`. If `s[left - 1]` was not '0', `leftOne` is `tleftOne - 2` and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
