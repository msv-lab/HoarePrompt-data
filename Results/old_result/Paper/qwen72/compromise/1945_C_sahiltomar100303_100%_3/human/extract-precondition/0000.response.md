Precondition: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wanting to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wanting to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
