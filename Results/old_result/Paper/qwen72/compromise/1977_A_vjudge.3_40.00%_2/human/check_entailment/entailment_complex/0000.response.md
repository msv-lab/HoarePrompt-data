### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove a cube from the tower in one move.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Conditions for Correctness:**
   - If `n == m`, it means Nikita can simply add `m` cubes one by one, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it means Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means Nikita can add `n` cubes and then remove one, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, it means the parity of the number of moves and the number of cubes is the same, which allows for the possibility of reaching exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because adding or removing a cube changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.
   - If the parity of `n` and `m` is different, it means it's impossible to reach exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "No".

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - `if n == m`: This is correct.
     - `elif m > n`: This is correct.
     - `elif m == n - 1`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This is correct.
     - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This is correct.
     - `else`: This is correct, as it covers the remaining cases where the parity of `n` and `m` is different.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 1 and `m` is 1, it will print "Yes". If `n` is 1 and `m` is 2, it will print "No".

5. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The function processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the conditions it checks.

Correctness: **True**
