The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or rely on external inputs or variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 for each test case. The function's output is not specified in the example, but typically, such a function would return a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Since the output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the parameters alone:

Functionality: **The function `func` is designed to operate based on external inputs or variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 for each test case. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided, but it is expected to return a result based on these parameters.**
