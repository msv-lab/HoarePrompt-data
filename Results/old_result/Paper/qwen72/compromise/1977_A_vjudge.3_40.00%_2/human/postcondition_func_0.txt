The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 100`, and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 100`. Based on the values of `n` and `m`, it prints 'Yes' if `n == m`, `m == n - 1`, both `n` and `m` are even, or both `n` and `m` are odd. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, and the final state of `n` and `m` is undefined as they are reassigned in each iteration.
