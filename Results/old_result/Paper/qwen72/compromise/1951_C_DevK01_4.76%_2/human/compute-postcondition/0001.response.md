The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a dummy variable, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a dummy variable**
