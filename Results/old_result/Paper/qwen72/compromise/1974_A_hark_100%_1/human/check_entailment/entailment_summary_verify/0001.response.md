Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and called at the beginning of the program.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then iterates over each test case.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Case Handling:**
   - The program handles four cases:
     - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
       - The remaining space is calculated by `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This formula is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
       - The correct formula should be `x - (bxsfory * (15 - 4))`, which accounts for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
       - Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds it to the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct.
     - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
       - It directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.
     - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed, which is correct.

4. **Mathematical Calculations:**
   - The program uses `math.ceil` to ensure that the number of screens is always rounded up to the nearest integer, which is correct for this problem since partial screens are not allowed.
   - However, the calculation for the remaining space for 1x1 icons in Case 1 is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `x - (bxsfory * (15 - 4))` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case, which is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - Due to the incorrect calculation in Case 1, the output for some test cases will be incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0, or both are 0.

7. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is flawed due to the incorrect formula used in Case 1.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons in Case 1.

Final: **False**
